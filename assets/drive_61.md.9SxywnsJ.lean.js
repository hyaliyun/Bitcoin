Twin City South Fulton is considered a twin city with Fulton, Kentucky. Together, they used to host the International Banana Festival in celebration of the fact that the twin cities railroad maintained an icing station for a large percentage of bananas en route to northern destinations arriving from New Orleans. A two-ton banana pudding was marched through a parade and served at the end of the parade route. Recently this Banana Festival was brought back in 2011. In 2012, they had the 50th anniversary of the Banana Festival. This festival occurs towards the end of September and includes the pudding, seller booths, and concessions. History South Fulton was first known as Jacksonville, and was named aptly so since land in the area once belonged to Andrew Jackson. It is recorded that Andrew Jackson sold in northeast Weakley County in 1823. Jacksonville existed from about 1859 until 1895 when South Fulton was first chartered.

It originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, was passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and is still used‚Äîin a modified form‚Äîfor measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates. The number 60, a superior highly composite number, has twelve factors, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60, of which 2, 3, and 5 are prime numbers. With so many factors, many fractions involving sexagesimal numbers are simplified. For example, one hour can be divided evenly into sections of 30 minutes, 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 12 minutes, 10 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute. 60 is the smallest number that is divisible by every number from 1 to 6; that is, it is the lowest common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. :In this article, all sexagesimal digits are represented as decimal numbers, except where otherwise noted. For example, 10 means the number ten and 60 means the number sixty. Origin It is possible for people to count on their fingers to 12 using one hand only, with the thumb pointing to each finger bone on the four fingers in turn. A traditional counting system still in use in many regions of Asia works in this way, and could help to explain the occurrence of numeral systems based on 12 and 60 besides those based on 10, 20 and 5. In this system, one hand counts repeatedly to 12, displaying the number of iterations on the other, until five dozens, i. e. the 60, are full.. Translated from the French by David Bellos, E.F. Harding, Sophie Wood and Ian Monk. According to Otto Neugebauer, the origins of sexagesimal are not as simple, consistent, or singular in time as they are often portrayed. Throughout their many centuries of use, which continues today for specialized topics such as time, angles, and astronomical coordinate systems, sexagesimal notations have always contained a strong undercurrent of decimal notation, such as in how sexagesimal digits are written. Their use has also always included (and continues to include) inconsistencies in where and how various bases are to represent numbers even within a single text. The most powerful driver for rigorous, fully self-consistent use of sexagesimal has always been its mathematical advantages for writing and calculating fractions. In ancient texts this shows up in the fact that sexagesimal is used most uniformly and consistently in mathematical tables of data. Another practical factor that helped expand the use of sexagesimal in the past even if less consistently than in mathematical tables, was its decided advantages to merchants and buyers for making everyday financial transactions easier when they involved bargaining for and dividing up larger quantities of goods. The early shekel in particular was one-sixtieth of a mana, though the Greeks later coerced this relationship into the more base-10 compatible ratio of a shekel being one- fiftieth of a mina. Apart from mathematical tables, the inconsistencies in how numbers were represented within most texts extended all the way down to the most basic cuneiform symbols used to represent numeric quantities. For example, the cuneiform symbol for 1 was an ellipse made by applying the rounded end of the stylus at an angle to the clay, while the sexagesimal symbol for 60 was a larger oval or \\"big 1\\". But within the same texts in which these symbols were used, the number 10 was represented as a circle made by applying the round end of the style perpendicular to the clay, and a larger circle or \\"big 10\\" was used to represent 100. Such multi-base numeric quantity symbols could be mixed with each other and with abbreviations, even within a single number. The details and even the magnitudes implied (since zero was not used consistently) were idiomatic to the particular time periods, cultures, and quantities or concepts being represented. While such context-dependent representations of numeric quantities are easy to critique in retrospect, in modern times we still have dozens of regularly used examples of topic- dependent base mixing, including the recent innovation of adding decimal fractions to sexagesimal astronomical coordinates. Usage=Babylonian mathematics The sexagesimal system as used in ancient Mesopotamia was not a pure base-60 system, in the sense that it did not use 60 distinct symbols for its digits. Instead, the cuneiform digits used ten as a sub-base in the fashion of a sign-value notation: a sexagesimal digit was composed of a group of narrow, wedge-shaped marks representing units up to nine (20px, 20px, 20px, 20px, ..., 20px) and a group of wide, wedge-shaped marks representing up to five tens (20px, 20px, 20px, 20px, 20px). The value of the digit was the sum of the values of its component parts: center Numbers larger than 59 were indicated by multiple symbol blocks of this form in place value notation. Because there was no symbol for zero it is not always immediately obvious how a number should be interpreted, and its true value must sometimes have been determined by its context. For example, the symbols for 1 and 60 are identical.. Later Babylonian texts used a placeholder (File:Babylonian digit 0.svg) to represent zero, but only in the medial positions, and not on the right-hand side of the number, as we do in numbers like . Other historical usages In the Chinese calendar, a sexagenary cycle is commonly used, in which days or years are named by positions in a sequence of ten stems and in another sequence of 12 branches. The same stem and branch repeat every 60 steps through this cycle. Book VIII of Plato's Republic involves an allegory of marriage centered on the number 604 = and its divisors. This number has the particularly simple sexagesimal representation 1,0,0,0,0. Later scholars have invoked both Babylonian mathematics and music theory in an attempt to explain this passage.. Ptolemy's Almagest, a treatise on mathematical astronomy written in the second century AD, uses base 60 to express the fractional parts of numbers. In particular, his table of chords, which was essentially the only extensive trigonometric table for more than a millennium, has fractional parts of a degree in base 60\\\\. Medieval astronomers also used sexagesimal numbers to note time. Al-Biruni first subdivided the hour sexagesimally into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths in 1000 while discussing Jewish months. Around 1235 John of Sacrobosco continued this tradition, although Nothaft thought Sacrobosco was the first to do so. The Parisian version of the Alfonsine tables (ca. 1320) used the day as the basic unit of time, recording multiples and fractions of a day in base 60 notation. The sexagesimal number system continued to be frequently used by European astronomers for performing calculations as late as 1671. For instance, Jost B√ºrgi in Fundamentum Astronomiae (presented to Emperor Rudolf II in 1592), his colleague Ursus in Fundamentum Astronomicum, and possibly also Henry Briggs, used multiplication tables based on the sexagesimal system in the late 16th Century, to calculate sines. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century Tamil astronomers were found to make astronomical calculations, reckoning with shells using a mixture of decimal and sexagesimal notations developed by Hellenistic astronomers.; reprinted in Base-60 number systems have also been used in some other cultures that are unrelated to the Sumerians, for example by the Ekari people of Western New Guinea.. See especially chapter 4 . Modern usage Modern uses for the sexagesimal system include measuring angles, geographic coordinates, electronic navigation, and time. One hour of time is divided into 60 minutes, and one minute is divided into 60 seconds. Thus, a measurement of time such as 3:23:17 can be interpreted as a whole sexagesimal number (no sexagesimal point), meaning . However, each of the three sexagesimal digits in this number (3, 23, and 17) is written using the decimal system. Similarly, the practical unit of angular measure is the degree, of which there are 360 (six sixties) in a circle. There are 60 minutes of arc in a degree, and 60 arcseconds in a minute. = YAML = In version 1.1http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/ of the YAML data storage format, sexagesimals are supported for plain scalars, and formally specified both for integershttp://yaml.org/type/int.html and floating point numbers.http://yaml.org/type/float.html This has led to confusion, as e.g. some MAC addresses would be recognised as sexagesimals and loaded as integers, where others were not and loaded as strings. In YAML 1.2 support for sexagesimals was dropped. Notations In Hellenistic Greek astronomical texts, such as the writings of Ptolemy, sexagesimal numbers were written using Greek alphabetic numerals, with each sexagesimal digit being treated as a distinct number. Hellenistic astronomers adopted a new symbol for zero, , which morphed over the centuries into other forms, including the Greek letter omicron, Œø, normally meaning 70, but permissible in a sexagesimal system where the maximum value in any position is 59. The Greeks limited their use of sexagesimal numbers to the fractional part of a number. In medieval Latin texts, sexagesimal numbers were written using Arabic numerals; the different levels of fractions were denoted minuta (i.e., fraction), minuta secunda, minuta tertia, etc. By the seventeenth century it became common to denote the integer part of sexagesimal numbers by a superscripted zero, and the various fractional parts by one or more accent marks. John Wallis, in his Mathesis universalis, generalized this notation to include higher multiples of 60; giving as an example the number ; where the numbers to the left are multiplied by higher powers of 60, the numbers to the right are divided by powers of 60, and the number marked with the superscripted zero is multiplied by 1. This notation leads to the modern signs for degrees, minutes, and seconds. The same minute and second nomenclature is also used for units of time, and the modern notation for time with hours, minutes, and seconds written in decimal and separated from each other by colons may be interpreted as a form of sexagesimal notation. In some usage systems, each position past the sexagesimal point was numbered, using Latin or French roots: prime or primus, seconde or secundus, tierce, quatre, quinte, etc. To this day we call the second-order part of an hour or of a degree a \\"second\\". Until at least the 18th century, of a second was called a \\"tierce\\" or \\"third\\". In the 1930s, Otto Neugebauer introduced a modern notational system for Babylonian and Hellenistic numbers that substitutes modern decimal notation from 0 to 59 in each position, while using a semicolon (;) to separate the integral and fractional portions of the number and using a comma (,) to separate the positions within each portion. For example, the mean synodic month used by both Babylonian and Hellenistic astronomers and still used in the Hebrew calendar is 29;31,50,8,20 days. This notation is used in this article.  Fractions and irrational numbers = Fractions  In the sexagesimal system, any fraction in which the denominator is a regular number (having only 2, 3, and 5 in its prime factorization) may be expressed exactly. Shown here are all fractions of this type in which the denominator is less or equal to 60: : = 0;30 : = 0;20 : = 0;15 : = 0;12 : = 0;10 : = 0;7,30 : = 0;6,40 : = 0;6 : = 0;5 : = 0;4 : = 0;3,45 : = 0;3,20 : = 0;3 : = 0;2,30 : = 0;2,24 : = 0;2,13,20 : = 0;2 : = 0;1,52,30 : = 0;1,40 : = 0;1,30 : = 0;1,20 : = 0;1,15 : = 0;1,12 : = 0;1,6,40 : = 0;1 However numbers that are not regular form more complicated repeating fractions. For example: : = 0; (the bar indicates the sequence of sexagesimal digits 8,34,17 repeats infinitely many times) : = 0; : = 0; : = 0;4, : = 0; : = 0; : = 0; : = 0; The fact that the two numbers that are adjacent to sixty, 59 and 61, are both prime numbers implies that fractions that repeat with a period of one or two sexagesimal digits can only have regular number multiples of 59 or 61 as their denominators, and that other non-regular numbers have fractions that repeat with a longer period.  Irrational numbers  Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 showing the sexagesimal number approximating The representations of irrational numbers in any positional number system (including decimal and sexagesimal) neither terminate nor repeat. The square root of 2, the length of the diagonal of a unit square, was approximated by the Babylonians of the Old Babylonian Period () as :1;24,51,10=1+\\\\frac{24}{60}+\\\\frac{51}{60^2}+\\\\frac{10}{60^3}=\\\\frac{30547}{21600}\\\\approx 1.41421296\\\\ldots Because ‚âà ... is an irrational number, it cannot be expressed exactly in sexagesimal (or indeed any integer-base system), but its sexagesimal expansion does begin 1;24,51,10,7,46,6,4,44...

History Copperhill is located in a geological region known as the Copper Basin, which was the site of a major copper mining operation between the 1840s and 1987. Starting around the time of the Civil War, the production method for removing the Sulphur from the copper ore mined in the area required building bonfires, throwing in the ore, and burning off the Sulphur. This necessitated cutting most of the trees in the valley for the bonfires. The acid rain caused by the burning of the Sulphur inhibited additional vegetation from growing, and the topsoil consequently washed off the hilly terrain due to lack of vegetation to hold it. Though acid plants were later built to convert the Sulphur into a useful product, the result of the earlier activities was that for years, up until the 1980s, the area was denuded of any greenery, and the red clay soil remaining gave it a Martian appearance. The area has now been greatly reforested, due to a multimillion-dollar effort by the successor companies to the original copper company. The copper and acid plants have been permanently closed and most of the plant infrastructure already removed and sold overseas. Much of the scrap metals from the site have been removed and sold to China. Glenn Springs Holdings has cleaned and purified all the surrounding creeks and waterways, and water quality is now back to near pristine condition according to published EPA and Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation studies. The town these days is a tourist attraction, with near daily rail excursions from Blue Ridge, Georgia, on the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, and near daily rail excursions from The Gee Creek Wilderness on the Hiwassee River train route. Whitewater rafting on the Ocoee River also attracts many people and other outdoor activities such as Mountain Biking and Hiking are also popular in the area.

A truss bridge over the river at the state line links them to Blue Ridge Drive (Georgia 5) to the south-southwest. In the early morning hours of February 16, 1990, a major flood struck the towns, although it is now hard to see any damage from this flooding. The upstream Blue Ridge Dam was raised several feet by the Tennessee Valley Authority, thus greatly minimizing any potential future possible occurrence of flooding. There have been no further incidents with the river flooding. As a result of the state line, homes and businesses on the Copperhill side of town have area code 423, while those on the McCaysville side have area code 706.

The population was 427 at the 2000 census and 475 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Cleveland Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Ducktown is located in a geological region known as the Copper Basin, and was the center of a major copper-mining district from 1847 until 1987. The district also produced iron, sulfur and zinc as byproducts.Maurice Magee (1968) Geology and ore deposits of the Ducktown district, Tennessee, in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933-1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.207-241. Ducktown was the birthplace of Rockabilly Hall of Famer, Stan Beaver. Literary historian Ben Harris McClary suggests that a Ducktown-area farmer named William \\"Sut\\" Miller (d. 1858) was the inspiration for the George Washington Harris character, Sut Lovingood.Henning Cohen, \\"Mark Twain's Sut Lovingood,\\" Sut Lovingood Papers (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1962), pp. 19-24. Ducktown and several Ducktown-area features, such as Big Frog Mountain and the Ocoee River (\\"Oconee\\"), are mentioned in the Sut Lovingood tales. The pre-mining period The Cherokee inhabited the Copper Basin as early as the late 18th century, well before the arrival of the first Euro- American settlers. Their territory extended into northern Georgia. The Cherokee village of Gawonvyi (also known as Kawana)-- which means ‚Äúduck place‚Äù in English-- is believed to have been located at the confluence of the Ocoee River and Tumbling Creek. The village's name was recorded on Cherokee annuity distribution rolls as \\"Ducktown\\" in 1799. According to tradition, Ducktown was named after a Cherokee leader named Chief Duck.R.E. Barclay, Ducktown Back in Raht's Time (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1946), 4-5. In 1836, the Cherokee relinquished control of the Copper Basin to the U.S. government as part of lands they ceded in Tennessee and Georgia in the Treaty of New Echota. Although the U.S. removed many of the basin's Cherokee inhabitants in the march to Indian Territory, some avoided the roundup by hiding out in the surrounding mountains. They would later help build the Old Copper Road (now part of US-64). In the 1840s and 1850s, Ducktown was called Hiwassee or Hiawassee, after the Cherokee name for a major river in the area. This name was subsequently adopted for the city's first major mining operation.Barclay, pp. 8-9. Early mining years thumbA train bringing copper ore out of the Ducktown mines, 1939. Smelter fumes have destroyed all vegetation and eroded the land. Photo by Marion Post Wolcott. The copper was discovered in 1843 by a prospector, presumably panning for gold, who found nuggets of native copper. The first shipment of copper ore was taken out on muleback in 1847. More than 30 mining companies were incorporated between 1852 and 1855 to mine copper at Ducktown. Development was accelerated by a road built in 1853 connecting the area with Cleveland, Tennessee. The first smelter was built in the Ducktown district in 1854. Mining ceased when Union troops destroyed the copper refinery and mill at Cleveland, Tennessee in 1863. Mining resumed in 1866, and continued until 1878, when the mines had exhausted the shallow high-grade copper ores. Later years By 1906, the Tennessee Copper Company had begun constructing an acid reclamation plant near Copperhill, Tennessee to recover most of the sulfur in the form of sulfuric acid rather than releasing it to the atmosphere. Froth flotation was added in the 1920s. Geography Ducktown is situated at the center of the Copper Basin (sometimes called the Ducktown Basin), a broad valley located in the southern Appalachian Mountains near the intersection of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina. The Ducktown area is part of the Ocoee River watershed, which passes through the Copper Basin a few miles southwest of Ducktown before entering its gorge. Ducktown is centered just north of the junction of Tennessee State Route 68, which connects the city to Madisonville to the north and Copperhill to the south, and U.S. Route 64, which connects the city to Cleveland (via the Ocoee River Gorge) to the west and Murphy, North Carolina to the east. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The Ducktown Basin Museum, located on the site of the Burra Burra Mine in Ducktown, chronicles the geology and history of the mining activities in the basin.

Dayton is a city and county seat in Rhea County, Tennessee, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 7,191. The Dayton Urban Cluster, which includes developed areas adjacent to the city and extends south to Graysville, had 10,174 people in 2010. Dayton was the site of the Scopes Trial in 1925 dealing with the creation‚Äìevolution controversy. History Downtown Dayton, 1925 The community was originally settled circa 1820 as Smith's Crossroads. In 1877, the town was renamed Dayton, after Dayton, Ohio. The town was incorporated in 1903. Early industry included manufacture of pig iron. Scopes trial In 1925, the famous Scopes Trial was held in Dayton and, for a period of time, filled the town with hucksters of every description and journalists from around the world. The participants included William Jennings Bryan in the role of prosecutor and Clarence Darrow as the principal defense counsel. The trial was over the issue of whether evolution should be taught in public schools. John T. Scopes, the defendant in the trial, was a local science teacher who was recruited by George Rappleyea to begin to teach evolution in his science class, and at the provocation of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), despite it being against Tennessee law at that time. Rappleyea believed that this conflict would create an enormous amount of publicity for the town, and he was proven correct. The town bustled with activity as people began to flock from near and far to hear the verdict on this controversial issue. Although this trial is often represented as being pivotal in the movement to allow evolution to be taught in American schools, it actually marked the beginning of a major decline in the teaching of evolution which did not start to recover until the early 1960s. Likewise, the Butler Act, which Scopes was supposed to have violated‚Äîthough it was never invoked again‚Äîremained on the books until 1967, when it was repealed by the Tennessee Legislature. H. L. Mencken famously covered the trial for the Baltimore Sun and recruited Clarence Darrow to lead the defense team. Immediately after the trial, Bryan continued to edit and deliver speeches, traveling hundreds of miles that week. On July 26, 1925, he drove from Chattanooga to Dayton to attend a church service, ate a meal, and died (the result of diabetes and fatigue) in his sleep that afternoon--just five days after the Scopes trial ended.

The population was 1,411 at the 2000 census and 1,502 at the 2010 census. History Graysville Academy, established in 1892 in Graysville, was a Seventh-day Adventist institution that was later to become Southern Adventist University. Graysville is named for William Gray, an early settler who was appointed postmaster in 1875. The town expanded in the 1880s, when the arrival of the railroad brought coal extraction industries to the area. During this period, the Dayton Coal and Iron Company established a major operation at Graysville. Coal mined nearby was converted into coke, which in turn was used to fuel two blast furnaces to produce pig iron. This operation continued until the Great Depression brought about a general collapse in the industry in the 1930s.E.

History Spring City began as a stop along the Cincinnati Southern Railroad in the 1870s. The town was originally named Sulphur Springs, because of the mass amount of sulphur in the water. Sometime later it became \\"Rheaville,\\" and later became incorporated with nearby Rhea Springs, and took on the name Rhea Springs. Due to an explosion, much of the town flooded or burnt, and the town relocated to its current location and was renamed Spring City, in honor of the original settlement, Sulphur Springs. The original location now lies at the bottom of a nearby section of Watts Bar Lake. Spring City thrived as a railroad shipping hub during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Kingston is adjacent to Watts Bar Lake. History Kingston has its roots in Fort Southwest Point, which was built just south of present-day Kingston in 1792. At the time, Southwest Point was on the fringe of the legal settlement area for Euro-Americans. A Cherokee village, headed by Chief Tollunteeskee, was situated just across the river, at what is now Rockwood. In 1805, Colonel Return J. Meigs, who operated out of Southwest Point, was appointed Cherokee Agent, effectively moving the agency from the Tellico Blockhouse to Southwest Point. The city of Kingston was established on October 23, 1799, as part of an effort to partition Knox County (the initial effort to form a separate county failed, but succeeded two years later).Snyder Roberts, \\"Thumbnail Sketch of Early Roane County History ,\\" 1969.

The North China Plain is shown in dark. The Yellow River is shown as \\"R√≠o Amarillo\\". The North China Plain () is a large-scale downfaulted rift basin formed in the late Paleogene and Neogene and then modified by the deposits of the Yellow River. It is the largest alluvial plain of China. The plain is bordered to the north by the Yanshan Mountains, to the west by the Taihang Mountains, to the south by the Dabie and Tianmu Mountains, and to the east by the Yellow Sea. The Yellow River flows through the middle of the plain into the Bohai Sea. Below the Sanmenxia Dam is the multipurpose Xiaolangdi Dam, located in the river's last valley before the North China Plain, a great delta created from silt dropped at the Yellow River's mouth over the millennia. The North China Plain extends over much of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, and merges with the Yangtze Delta in northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The Yellow River meanders over the fertile, densely populated plain emptying into the Bohai Sea. The plain is one of China's most important agricultural regions, producing corn, sorghum, winter wheat, vegetables, and cotton. Its nickname is \\"Land of the yellow earth\\". The southern part of the plain is traditionally referred to as the Central Plain (), which formed the cradle of Chinese civilization.BASIC INFORMATION ON CHINA The plain covers an area of about , most of which is less than above sea level. This flat yellow-soil plain is the main area of sorghum, millet, maize, and cotton production in China. Wheat, sesame seed, and peanuts are also grown here. The plain is one of the most densely populated regions in the world. Beijing, the national capital, is located on the northeast edge of the plain, with Tianjin, an important industrial city and commercial port, near its northeast coast. Shengli Oil Field in Shandong is an important petroleum base. Historical significance The geography of the North China Plain has had profound cultural and political implications. Unlike areas to the south of the Yangtze, the plain generally runs uninterrupted by mountains and has far fewer rivers, and as a result communication by horse is rapid within the plain. As a result, the spoken language is relatively uniform in contrast to the plethora of languages and dialects in southern China. In addition the possibility of rapid communication has meant that the political center of China has tended to be located here.Ramsey, S. Robert, The Languages of China. Princeton University Press (1987), pp. 19-26. Because the fertile soil of the North China Plain gradually merges with the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria, Inner Mongolia, and Northeast China, the plain has been prone to invasion from nomadic or semi-nomadic ethnic groups originating from those regions, prompting the construction of the Great Wall of China. Although the soil of the North China Plain is fertile, the weather is unpredictable, being at the intersection of humid winds from the Pacific and dry winds from the interior of the Asian continent. This makes the plain prone to both floods and drought. Moreover, the flatness of the plain promotes massive flooding when river works are damaged. Many historians have proposed that these factors have encouraged the development of a centralized Chinese state to manage granaries, maintain hydraulic works, and administer fortifications against the steppe peoples. (The \\"hydraulic society\\" school holds that early states developed in the valleys of the Nile, Euphrates, Indus and Yellow Rivers due to the need to supervise large numbers of laborers to build irrigation canals and control floods.)

Roane Iron Company The Roane Iron Company furnace site at the end of Rockwood Street; the small building on the left is all that remains of the once vast iron works Union general John T. Wilder, who in the 1850s had managed a foundry in Indiana, noted the iron ore and coal deposits of the Cumberland Plateau region while operating in the area during the Civil War. After the war, Wilder and Ohio-born Knoxville Iron Company founder Hiram Chamberlain (1835-1916) purchased at what is now Rockwood, selecting the location due to the ore and coal resources at the base of Walden Ridge, the proximity to the Tennessee River, and an assumption that the encroaching railroads would descend the Plateau at nearby Emory Gap. Wilder and Chamberlain enlisted several other investors from Indiana and Ohio, and the Roane Iron Company was chartered on June 18, 1867.William Moore, \\"Preoccupied Paternalism: The Roane Iron Company In Her Company Town-- Rockwood, Tennessee.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications Vol. 39 (1967), pp. 56-70. By late 1868, the company had constructed a blast furnace with a capacity of 15 tons per day between the ridge and the end of what is now Rockwood Street.John Benhart, Appalachian Aspirations: The Geography of Urbanization and Development in the Upper Tennessee River Valley, 1865-1900 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2007), pp. 5-7. The company mined coal and iron ore along the ridge, which it transported by narrow-gauge rail to the furnace site. The coal was delivered to coking ovens, where it was converted into coke, and the coke was then used to generate the temperatures needed to convert the iron ore into pig iron. The pig iron was then shipped by river to rolling mills in Knoxville and Chattanooga, and was used primarily in railroad construction. In the early 1880s, Roane Iron purchased a rolling mill in Chattanooga and experimented with steel production, but the Walden Ridge ore proved to be too low-quality for such a process, and the company abandoned its steel venture in 1889.Benhart, pp. 34-41. Roane Iron's Rockwood furnace employed a mix of local labor (both caucasian and African-American) and immigrants (especially Welsh immigrants), and did not practice wage discrimination. The company paid workers either cash, which was issued on paydays, or scrip, which could be issued anytime at the worker's request. Other than a miners' strike in 1904, Roane Iron experienced relatively few labor disputes, even though labor organizations were active in Rockwood. A series of mining accidents-- namely a 1926 mine explosion-- damaged the company's image and led to out-of-control workers' compensation payments, however, and in 1929 Roane Iron shut down operations. Development of Rockwood Worried that the region's Confederate-sympathizers might shun an operation led by a well-known Union general, Wilder decided to name Roane Iron's company town after one of its lesser-known Indiana investors, William O. Rockwood. In spite of the name, William Rockwood played only a minor role in Roane Iron's affairs, and the early development of the town was largely the work of Wilder and Chamberlain. Unlike the \\"boom\\" towns in nearby Cardiff and Harriman, Rockwood's growth was gradual. Rockwood's population grew from 696 in 1870 to 1,011 in 1880. By 1890, the city's population had swelled to 2,305. A parade in Rockwood in 1940 For the first 50 years of its existence, Rockwood was polarized by the temperance issue. Wilder, a prohibitionist, banned alcoholic beverages on company property, and tried in vain to prevent drunkenness in the town throughout the 1870s. Saloons became commonplace in Rockwood in the 1880s, however, and Roane Iron began to struggle with absenteeism, as many employees worked for just a few days per week in order to make enough money for a \\"weekend of drinking and fighting.\\" In 1887, after the state's \\"four-mile\\" law effectively banned saloons in unincorporated areas, a section of the town incorporated as \\"East Rockwood\\" to dodge the law. Rockwood, which incorporated in 1890, passed an ordinance banning the sale of alcohol in 1903, but the ordinance didn't apply to railroads, and the so-called \\"jug train\\" from Chattanooga continued supplying Rockwood with liquor until the statewide prohibition law took effect in 1909. Noting the success of land auctions in nearby Cardiff and Harriman, Roane Iron held its own land auction for Rockwood in May 1890, selling several hundred lots and raising $600,000. To promote the city, the company laid out new streets, built new hotels, and allowed general stores to set up shop in the city and compete with the company store. These de-paternalization measures helped Rockwood survive the Panic of 1893, which doomed neighboring Cardiff. 20th century In the early 20th century, Rockwood's economy further diversified. Former Roane Iron employee James Tarwater founded Rockwood Mills, which manufactured hosiery, in 1905. Another former Roane Iron employee, Sewell Howard, established Rockwood Stove Works in 1916. After Roane Iron's collapse in 1929, Rockwood struggled with unemployment. At the outbreak of World War II, however, the Tennessee Products Corporation reopened the iron works to produce ferromanganese for the wartime effort. Like other Roane County communities, Rockwood's economy was boosted by the government's construction of nearby Oak Ridge during World War II. Notable people * Harry T.

The economy was based on services to surrounding farmers; the main crop in the area was tobacco. By the 1960s, crops were more diversified and more farmers had cars, enabling them to travel to the county seat of Springfield, about nine miles away.

That area was at the southern edge of what became known as the Transylvania Purchase, land purchased in 1775 from the Cherokee by Richard Henderson, a North Carolina land speculator seeking to establish a 14th colony. Although Transylvania, the proposed 14th colony, was never recognized, the area was settled by immigrants in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. David Naive settled there in 1825, and the area became known as Naive‚Äôs Crossroads. During subsequent years, the county's involvement in the production of barrels and whiskey led to the establishment of one or more cooper shops in the community, making barrels for the nearby Red River mills. The presence of coopers led to the community's present name. Coopertown was officially incorporated in 1996, a decision taken by the citizens of the community in response to a proposal to locate a landfill in the community. In August 2005, Coopertown Middle School opened, serving grades 6 to 8, and in 2007, grades 4 and 5 would move to the middle school.

It is located southeast of Knoxville and had a population of 3,944 at the 2010 Census and an estimated U.S. Census population of 4,144 in 2018. It is a popular vacation resort, as it rests on the border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park along U.S. Route 441, which connects to Cherokee, North Carolina, on the southeast side of the national park. Prior to incorporation, the town was known as White Oak Flats, or just simply White Oak. History= Early history  The William \\"Old Billy\\" and Martha Jane Huskey Ogle Cabin in Gatlinburg Downtown Gatlinburg For centuries, Cherokee hunters, as well as other Native American hunters before the Cherokee, used a footpath known as Indian Gap Trail to access the abundant game in the forests and coves of the Smokies.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 322‚Äì323. This trail connected the Great Indian Warpath with Rutherford Indian Trace, following the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River from modern-day Sevierville through modern-day Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and the Sugarlands, crossing the crest of the Smokies along the slopes of Mount Collins, and descending into North Carolina along the banks of the Oconaluftee River.Strutin, 322‚Äì323. US-441 largely follows this same route today, although it crests at Newfound Gap rather than Indian Gap. Although various 18th-century European and early American hunters and fur trappers probably traversed or camped in the flats where Gatlinburg is now situated, it was Edgefield, South Carolina, native William Ogle (1751‚Äì1803) who first decided to permanently settle in the area.Gladys Trentham Russell, Smoky Mountain Family Album (Alcoa, Tennessee: Gladys Trentham Russell, 1984), 6. With the help of the Cherokee, Ogle cut, hewed, and notched logs in the flats, planning to erect a cabin the following year.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18. He returned home to Edgefield to retrieve his family and grow one final crop for supplies. However, shortly after his arrival in Edgefield, a malaria epidemic swept the low country, and Ogle succumbed to the disease in 1803.Russell, 6. His widow, Martha Huskey Ogle (1756‚Äì1827), moved the family to Virginia, where she had relatives. Some time around 1806, Martha Huskey Ogle made the journey over Indian Gap Trail to what is now Gatlinburg with her brother, Peter Huskey, her daughter, Rebecca, and her daughter's husband, James McCarter. William Ogle's notched logs awaited them, and they erected a cabin near the confluence of Baskins Creek and the West Fork of the Little Pigeon shortly after their arrival. The cabin still stands today near the heart of Gatlinburg. James and Rebecca McCarter settled in the Cartertown district of Gatlinburg.Zeno Wall, \\"Gatlinburg\\", Newport (Newport, Tennessee: Ideal Publishing Company, 1970), 132. White Oak Flats Cemetery In the decade following the arrival of the Ogles, McCarters, and Huskeys in what came to be known as White Oak Flats, a steady stream of settlers moved into the area. Most were veterans of the American Revolution or War of 1812 who had converted the tracts they had received for service in war into deeds.Wall, 128. Among these early settlers were Timothy Reagan (c. 1750‚Äì1830), John Ownby, Jr. (1791‚Äì1857), and Henry Bohanon (1760‚Äì1842).Donald Reagan, Smoky Mountain Clans (Gatlinburg: Donald B.

Radford Gatlin and the Civil War  In 1856, a post office was established in the general store of Radford Gatlin (c. 1798‚Äì1880), giving the town the name \\"Gatlinburg.\\"Abramson, 644. Despite the fact that the town bore his name, Gatlin, who didn't arrive in the flats until around 1854, constantly bickered with his neighbors.J.A. Sharp, \\"Radford Gatlin: Gatlinburg's First Tourist\\" Accessed: May 19, 2007. By 1857, a full-blown feud had erupted between the Gatlins and the Ogles, probably over Gatlin's attempts to divert the town's main road. The eve of the U.S. Civil War found Gatlin, who became a Confederate sympathizer, at odds with the residents of the flats, who were mostly pro-Union, and he was forced out in 1859.Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 123‚Äì124. Despite its anti-slavery sentiments, Gatlinburg, like most Smoky Mountain communities, tried to remain neutral during the war. This changed when a company of Confederate Colonel William Holland Thomas' Legion occupied the town to protect the salt peter mines at Alum Cave, near the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Federal forces marched south from Knoxville and Sevierville to drive out Thomas' men, who had built a small fort on Burg Hill.Wall, 128‚Äì132. Lucinda Oakley Ogle, whose grandfather witnessed the ensuing skirmish, later recounted her grandfather's recollections: > ... he told me about when he was a sixteen year old boy during the Civil War > and would hide under a big cliff on Turkey Nest Ridge and watch the Blue > Coats ride their horses around the graveyard hill, shooting their cannon > toward Burg Hill where the Grey Coats had a fort and would ride their horses > around the Burg Hill ...Lucinda Oakley Ogle, Jerry Wear (editor), > Sugarlands: A Lost Community In Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, > Tennessee: Sevierville Heritage Committee, 1986), 57. As the Union forces converged on the town, the outnumbered Confederates were forced to retreat across the Smokies to North Carolina. Confederate forces did not return, although sporadic small raids continued until the end of the war.  Early 20th century  In the 1880s, the invention of the band saw and the logging railroad led to a boom in the lumber industry. As forests throughout the Southeastern United States were harvested, lumber companies pushed deeper into the mountain areas of the Appalachian highlands. In 1901, Colonel W.B. Townsend established the Little River Lumber Company in Tuckaleechee Cove to the west, and lumber interests began buying up logging rights to vast tracts of forest in the Smokies.Frome, 165‚Äì166. Andrew Jackson Huff (1878‚Äì1949), originally of Greene County, was a pivotal figure in Gatlinburg at this time. Huff erected a sawmill in Gatlinburg in 1900,Frome, 161. and local residents began supplementing their income by providing lodging to loggers and other lumber company officials. Tourists also began to trickle into the area, drawn to the Smokies by the writings of authors such as Mary Noailles Murfree and Horace Kephart, who wrote extensively about the region's natural wonders. In 1912, the Pi Beta Phi women's fraternity established a settlement school (now Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts) in Gatlinburg after a survey of the region found the town to be most in need of educational facilities in the area.Pearl Cashell Jackson, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (University of Texas, 1927), 14. Although skeptical locals were initially worried that the fraternity might be religious propagandists or opportunists, the school's enrollment grew from 33 to 134 in its first year of operation.Jackson, 11, 39. Along with providing basic education to children in the area, the school's staff created a small market for local crafts. The journals and letters of the Pi Beta Phi settlement school's staff are a valuable source of information about daily life in Gatlinburg in the early 1900s. Phyllis Higinbotham, a nurse from Toronto who worked at the school for six years, wrote of the mountain peoples' confusion over the role of a nurse, their penchant for calling on her for minute issues, and her difficulties with Appalachian customs: > I soon found that people weren't used to hurrying, and that it takes a long > time of patient waiting and general conversation to find out what they have > really come for, or to get a history of the cases when making a visit.

Higinbotham complained that there was an unhealthy \\"lack of variety\\" in the mountain peoples' diet and that they weren't open to new suggestions. Food was often \\"too starchy,\\" \\"not well cooked,\\" and supplemented with certain excesses: > One of the doctors was called to several cases of honey poisoning. The men > had robbed some bee gums, eaten a pound or two of each and been knocked > unconscious where they stood.Higinbotham, 27. Evelyn Bishop, a Pi Beta Phi who arrived at the school in 1913, reported that the mountain peoples' relative isolation from American society allowed them to retain folklore that reflected their English and Scots-Irish ancestries, such as Elizabethan Era ballads: > Many times it is the ballad that the child learns first, no Mother Goose > melodies are as familiar, and it is strange indeed to listen to a little tot > singing of the courtly days of old, the knights and 'ladyes' and probably > the tragic death of the lover.Evelyn Bishop, \\"Folk Lore\\", Pi Beta Phi > Settlement School (University of Texas, 1927), 31. Such isolation attracted folklorists such as Cecil Sharp of London to the area in the years following World War I.Bishop, 32‚Äì35 Sharp's collection of Appalachian ballads was published in 1932.  National park  Gatlinburg Trail entering Gatlinburg from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Extensive logging in the early 1900s led to increased calls by conservationists for federal action, and in 1911, Congress passed the Weeks Act to allow for the purchase of land for national forests. Authors such as Horace Kephart and Knoxville-area businesses began advocating for the creation of a national park in the Smokies that would be similar to Yellowstone or Yosemite in the Western United States. With the purchase of in the Little River Lumber Company tract in 1926, the movement quickly became a reality.Frome, 166‚Äì191. Andrew Huff spearheaded the movement in the Gatlinburg area, and he opened the first hotel in Gatlinburg ‚Äì the Mountain View Hotel ‚Äì in 1916.Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 33. His son, Jack, established LeConte Lodge atop Mount Le Conte in 1926.Brewer, 110. In spite of resistance from lumberers at Elkmont and difficulties with the Tennessee legislature, Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened in 1934. The park radically changed Gatlinburg. When the Pi Beta Phis arrived in 1912, Gatlinburg was a small hamlet with six houses, a blacksmith shop, a general store, a Baptist church, and a greater community of 600 individuals, most of whom lived in log cabins.Jackson, 11. In 1934, the first year the park was open, an estimated 40,000 visitors passed through the city. Within a year, this number had increased exponentially to 500,000. From 1940 to 1950, the cost of land in Gatlinburg increased from $50 to $8,000 per acre.North Callahan, Smoky Mountain Country (New York: Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1952), 222. While the park's arrival benefited Gatlinburg and made many of the town's residents wealthy, the tourism explosion led to problems with air quality and urban sprawl. Even in modern times, the town's infrastructure is often pushed to the limit on peak vacation days and must consistently adapt to accommodate the growing number of tourists. Fire of 1992 On the night of July 14, 1992, Gatlinburg gained national attention when an entire city block burned to the ground due to faulty wiring in a light fixture. The Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum was consumed by the fire, along with an arcade, haunted house, and souvenir shop. The blaze was stopped before it could consume the adjacent 32-story Gatlinburg Space Needle. Known to locals as \\"Rebel Corner,\\" the block was completely rebuilt and reopened to visitors in 1995. Few artifacts from the Ripley's Museum were salvaged, and those that survived are clearly marked with that designation in the new museum. The fire prompted new downtown building codes and a new downtown fire station. Ripley's has caught fire twice since it reopened, once in 2000 and again in 2003. Both of those fires, coincidentally, were caused by faulty light fixtures. The 2000 fire caused no damage, and the 2003 fire was contained to the building's exterior, with the museum suffering minimal damage, primarily cosmetic. Fire of 2016 Starting in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park at Chimney Tops, a moderately contained wildfire was compounded by very strong winds ‚Äì with gusts recorded up to 87 miles per hour ‚Äì and extremely dry conditions due to drought, causing it to spread down into Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Pittman Center, and other nearby areas. It forced mass evacuations, and Governor Bill Haslam ordered the National Guard to the area. The center of Gatlinburg's tourist district escaped heavy damage, but the surrounding wooded region was called \\"the apocalypse\\" by a fire department lieutenant.Amy Vellucci and Jamie Satterfield, \\"Tennessee Wildfires: 'It's the Apocalypse on Both Sides (of Downtown),'\\" WFAA.com, November 29, 2016. Approximately 14,000 people were evacuated that evening, more than 2,400 structures were damaged or destroyed, and damages totaled more than $500 million. Fourteen lives were lost in the fires, some local citizens and some visiting tourists. Following the fires, the town of Gatlinburg was shut down and considered a crime scene. The city reopened to residents only after a few days but maintained a strict curfew for more than a week, only reopening to the public after the curfew was lifted.\\"$500M in Damages Expected Due to Gatlinburg Fires,\\" News Channel 3, December 13, 2016. In June 2017, the Sevier County district attorney dropped the charges against the two juveniles due to an inability to prove their actions led to the devastation that occurred in Gatlinburg five days later. According to D.A. James Dunn in an official statement, other factors played a key role, particularly the wind: > But for the winds that reached speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour, it is > highly unlikely and improbable that the Chimney Tops II fire would have left > the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and reached Gatlinburg. In May 2018, two Gatlinburg residents filed a $14.8 million lawsuit against the federal government for personal losses suffered in the fire.

History=Early history alt= The name \\"Pigeon Forge\\" comes from an iron forge built by Isaac Love (1783‚Äì1854) some time around 1820. The name of this forge referred to its location along the Little Pigeon River, in the vicinity of what is now the Old Mill. The name of the river comes from the flocks of passenger pigeons that frequented its banks at the time of the first Euro- American settlers' arrival.J.A. Sharp, \\"The Historic Beginnings of Pigeon Forge\\" The Sevier County Library History Center Website. Retrieved: September 15, 2007. For centuries, the Cherokee used the valley where Pigeon Forge is now located as a hunting ground. A Cherokee footpath known as \\"Indian Gap Trail\\" crossed the Great Smokies from North Carolina and passed through the Pigeon Forge valley en route to its junction with Great Indian Warpath in modern Sevierville. (US-441 closely parallels this ancient trail, although it crests the mountains at Newfound Gap rather than Indian Gap). From Sevierville, Great Indian Warpath headed west toward the Overhill Cherokee towns along the Little Tennessee River.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 322-323. 18th century Indian Gap Trail brought the first Europeans to the Pigeon Forge area in the early 18th century. Along with hunters and trappers from North Carolina, traders from Virginia passed through the valley before 1750. Some time after 1783, Colonel Samuel Wear became one of the first permanent white settlers in the Pigeon Forge area. A veteran of the American Revolution, Wear erected a stockade near the confluence of Walden Creek and Little Pigeon River (now Pigeon Forge City Park) in 1792. This \\"fort\\" provided a safe stopover for early pioneers in the Sevier County area. Wear later served as a member of the committee that drafted Tennessee's state constitution.J.G.M. Ramsey, Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City, Tennessee: Overmountain Press, 1999), 652. In 1785, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, ceding much of what is now Sevier County to the United States.Goodspeed Publishing Company, \\"The History of Sevier County ,\\" The History of Tennessee, 1887. Retrieved: September 15, 2007. Among the first to take advantage of this was Robert Shields (1740‚Äì1802), who received a survey for a tract of land in the Pigeon Forge area from the Watauga Land Office in 1786. Shields, who was also a veteran of the Revolution, established a small fort along Middle Creek near what is now Dollywood.Beulah Linn, \\"The Horatio Butler House,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 20, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 13. Shields' son later wrote that the fort was long and wide, with walls constructed with \\"heavy logs.\\" The fort contained living quarters for six families, with a common kitchen at one end and a common living room at the other. As his family grew, Shields constructed separate houses for his children, one of which was purchased by Horatio Butler in 1797 and remained with his descendants until it was torn down in 1994. Although the Shields Fort was too far from the main Cherokee trails to ever experience a serious assault, the Wear Fort straddled Indian Gap Trail, making it a target for small bands of Cherokee warriors. After the Cherokee attacked his fort in 1793, a frustrated Wear led a band of 60 frontiersmen across the northwestern Smokies into the Overhill Cherokee region, where they attacked and destroyed the town of Tallassee (near modern- day Calderwood Dam), killing at least 15 Cherokees and capturing several others. In 1794, the Cherokee fired on Wear and his two sons just outside Calvin's Blockhouse (near Maryville), but they both escaped unharmed.J.G.M. Ramsey, Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City, Tennessee: Overmountain Press, 1999), 591. Although treaties negotiated at Tellico Blockhouse in 1794 and 1798 brought calm to the region, sporadic fighting between Cherokees and the settlers continued. One notable incident occurred in 1802, when Tavenor Runyan (1787‚Äì1802), the son of Isaac Barefoot Runyan (1749‚Äì1845) and Margaret RamboDescendants of Isaac Barefoot Runyan by Marie Runyan Wright, Gallway Press 1980 (who had settled near the heart of modern Pigeon Forge), was killed by a Cherokee warrior. The recently elected Governor Archibald Roane was forced to personally intervene to prevent retaliatory strikes. 19th century Bishop Francis Asbury monument at Shiloh Memorial Cemetery. Like many Appalachian communities, religion played a major role in the early history of Pigeon Forge. In the early 19th century, circuit riders preached in the valley, creating a large Methodist following that remains to the present day. On October 20, 1808, Bishop Francis Asbury delivered a sermon at what is now Shiloh Memorial Cemetery in the northern half of Pigeon Forge, where a crude log church was erected.Information obtained from Shiloh Memorial Cemetery Association plaque at Shiloh Memorial Cemetery in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The first \\"tourists\\" to visit Pigeon Forge came for the extended revivals that were held in the Middle Creek area on the grounds of what is now Middle Creek Methodist Church as early as 1822. These revivals could last for weeks at a time.Beulah Linn, \\"The Isaac Trotter Papers,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 2 (Summer 1986): 33. In 1810, Revolutionary War veteran Mordecai Lewis obtained a land grant along the Little Pigeon River near the heart of what is now Pigeon Forge. In 1817, Lewis' son-in-law, Isaac Love (1783‚àí1854), established the iron forge for which the city was eventually named. The complex included a bloomery furnace and water-powered trip hammer to smelt and mold ore into iron bars. Love erected the Pigeon Forge Mill in 1830, and on May 29, 1841, Love's son, William, established a post office ‚Äì which he named \\"Pigeon Forge\\" ‚Äì for the mill and the small community that had developed in its vicinity. Local businessman John Sevier Trotter (1807‚àí1884) purchased the mill and furnace in 1849 and subsequently made numerous modifications, including the addition of a sawmill.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), pp. 24-25, 30, 44. Although the iron furnace was sold and relocated in the 1880s, the Pigeon Forge Mill ‚Äì usually called \\"Old Mill\\" ‚Äì still stands and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1870s, a health resort was established in Pigeon Forge at Henderson Springs, adjacent to the Fort Wear site on the town's north side.C. Brenden Martin, \\"Pigeon Forge, Tennessee,\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 667. It was common during this period for the residents of large urban areas to visit mountain springs, the waters of which were believed to have health- restoring qualities. 20th century In the early 20th century, Pigeon Forge was an isolated mountain hamlet with no major roads. The nearest railroad station was in Sevierville. Bridges were also rare, with the only major water crossings being a string of fords along the Little Pigeon.Beulah Linn, \\"The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Journal 22, no. 2 (Summer 1996): 3.Pearl Cashell Jackson, pi beta phi settlement school (University of Texas, 1927), 14. When Great Smoky Mountains National Park opened in 1934, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported no tourism-oriented businesses in Pigeon Forge. By the 1950s, improvements to US-441 led to the establishment of a few campgrounds and lodges, but they did not generate major revenue. During this period, however, two factors in nearby Gatlinburg led to the eventual commercial boom Pigeon Forge experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. First, surrounded by high mountain ridges, Gatlinburg had limited land resources. Second, its land resources were largely controlled by a few local families who thwarted attempts by outside businesses to take advantage of the town's prime location. Thus, outside entrepreneurs were forced to look elsewhere. Pigeon Forge, located just north of Gatlinburg along US-441, became a target. In 1961, shortly after Pigeon Forge officially incorporated, North Carolina brothers Grover and Harry Robbins opened Rebel Railroad in the town's Middle Creek area. The railroad simulated a ride on a Confederate steam train that was under attack by Union soldiers during the Civil War, playing upon the centennial anniversary of the war. After the Union assault was beaten back, the railroad came to a stop at a mock frontier mountain town, complete with blacksmith shop, general store, and saloon. By 1964, interest in the Civil War Centennial was beginning to die down, so the Robbins brothers decided to rename the railroad Goldrush Junction. The attraction was reworked with a \\"Wild West\\" theme replacing the Civil War theme, in a similar fashion to the Robbins' other tourist train ride in North Carolina, Tweetsie Railroad. Goldrush Junction was much more successful than Rebel Railroad, prompting the Robbinses to buy a log flume amusement ride and erect it on the property in 1967.Hollis, Tim. \\"Tweetsie and Dolly rush for the Gold.\\" The Land of the Smokies: Great Mountain Memories. 1st ed. Jackson, MS: The University Press of Mississippi, 2007. 124‚Äì129. According to a park tourist brochure from the time, the ride was \\"brought to Goldrush Junction from the New York World's Fair, where it was one of the most successful attractions.\\"Goldrush Junction tourist brochure. In 1969, after Pigeon Forge issued a zoning plan assigning the entire strip along US-441 for tourism use, Art Modell (owner of the Cleveland Browns) purchased Goldrush Junction. In 1976, Modell sold it to the Herschend Brothers of Branson, Missouri. The Herschends renamed the park Silver Dollar City after their successful theme park in Branson.C. Brenden Martin and Camille Wells, \\"Dollywood,\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 639. The Ozark mountain theme of the Branson location was easily reapplied as an Appalachian theme in Pigeon Forge, and the park's attendance began to climb. In 1982, hoping to capitalize on the publicity generated by the Knoxville World's Fair, Pigeon Forge initiated an aggressive economic plan that centered around theme parks, outlet malls, and live music venues. The first outlet mall, Factory Merchants, opened that same year. By 1987, there were four outlet malls in Pigeon Forge, and by the early 1990s, outlet malls provided 44% of the town's gross revenue.Margaret Foraker, \\"Economic Dependency and Tourism\\", Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 640. The increasing number of tourist attractions brought competition for Silver Dollar City and its chief competitor in Pigeon Forge, Magic World, which had constructed a theme park on the slopes of Pine Mountain in the city's south section. In 1985, the Herschends approached entertainer Dolly Parton (who was born in nearby Sevierville) with a proposal for a partnership in the promotion and operation of Silver Dollar City. After lengthy negotiations, Parton became a majority partner in the enterprise, and Silver Dollar City was renamed Dollywood to launch a major marketing campaign. Magic World folded in 1994. 21st century Although the commercial boom in Pigeon Forge vastly increased the town's revenue, it had several undesirable effects. As land value increased, many farmers could no longer afford the accompanying high property taxes and were forced to sell their land. The high cost of living in Pigeon Forge is difficult to offset with the low wage jobs that often accompany the tourist industry.Margaret Foraker, \\"Economic Dependency and Tourism,\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 640. Dollywood continued expansion into the 21st century, adding a separate water park in 2001. In 2016, the area was affected by the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.

Geography The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River.Pigeon Forge is located at (35.793946, ‚àí83.564124) on the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.6 square miles (30.0 km), all of which is land. The West Fork of the Little Pigeon River flows north from its source high on the slopes of Mount Collins through Sevier County before linking up with the Middle Fork in Sevierville. Pigeon Forge occupies a narrow valley along this river between Sevierville and Gatlinburg. High ridges surround Pigeon Forge on three sides, with Pine Mountain to the west, Shields Mountain to the east, and Cove Mountain to the south. A bend in the Little Pigeon provides the city's northern border with Sevierville, and a narrow gorge cut by the river between Cove Mountain and Shields Mountain acts as the city's boundary with Gatlinburg. U.S. Route 441, known as \\"The Parkway\\", runs through the middle of Pigeon Forge en route to Gatlinburg and Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where it crests at Newfound Gap before descending to Cherokee, North Carolina. The six-lane strip along US-441 contains most of Pigeon Forge's tourist attractions. U.S. Route 321 (known as Wears Valley Road in Pigeon Forge) connects the town with Wears Valley and Townsend to the west. Teaster Lane runs along the eastern side of the city and serves as a local four-lane road bypassing some of the Parkway and is relatively undeveloped, except a few shopping centers. TN-449 serves as a bypass for both Sevierville and most of Pigeon Forge and directly connects with Dollywood.  Climate  Pigeon Forge has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb) with cool winters and hot summers. Precipitation is heavy year round, peaking during the months of May‚ÄìJuly, with October being the driest month, having only 2.67 inches (68 mm) of average annual precipitation.

Notable people * Samuel Wear (1753‚Äì1817): A Revolutionary War veteran, Wear co-founded the \\"Lost State of Franklin\\" and helped draft Tennessee's state constitution. He established a stockade called Wears Fort in the area that became Pigeon Forge. * Dolly Parton (1946‚Äì): A country music singer and songwriter who has written thousands of songs, Parton has a variety of business interests in the tourism industry in Pigeon Forge, including joint ownership of attractions like Dollywood and Dolly Parton's Stampede.  Alcoholic beverages  Unlike neighboring Gatlinburg and Sevierville, Pigeon Forge remained a dry jurisdiction in the state (Tennessee is dry by default) for many years, with only a few select premises allowed to sell low-alcohol beers and some wines. Certain sectors of the population, including religious leaders, opposed legalizing liquor, warning of the social consequences, while others argued that the city was losing tax dollars to neighboring cities by not selling alcohol. Referendums to permit liquor-by- the-drink sales inside the city limits failed in 2009 and 2011. Another liquor-by-the-drink referendum appeared to have won by a 100-vote margin in a contentious 2012 vote, in which the number of ballots cast exceeded the number of eligible voters by more than 300. In court depositions taken in connection with a lawsuit to overturn the election, one registrar testified that her instructions were to allow everyone listed on her roster to vote on the referendum, regardless of whether they lived inside the city limits. Poll worker Sarah Ownby said in her deposition she was \\"100 percent sure\\" ballots were cast by people not entitled to vote on the issue. Ownby also testified some voters who were eligible to vote in the referendum were not allowed to do so. On January 10, 2013, Sevier County Chancellor Telford Forgety ruled that the 2012 liquor-by-the-drink referendum would be invalidated due to its questionable results. The chancellor ordered that a new vote be held within 45 to 60 days.Balloch, Jim. (January 10, 2013). \\"Judge rules Pigeon Forge liquor vote must be scrapped, orders new election\\". The Knoxville News-Sentinel: Retrieved November 1, 2013. On March 13, 2013, liquor-by-the drink passed in Pigeon Forge by a vote of 952 to 798. As a result, authorized businesses can now obtain on-premise consumption licenses to sell and dispense beverages with an alcohol content greater than 8%. This includes liquors as well as high- alcohol content beers and wines.

Dolly on Dolly: interviews and encounters with Dolly Parton. Chicago Review Press. . History Burnett Memorial Chapel Like much of Sevier County, Emert's Cove was a Cherokee hunting ground before the arrival of Euro- American settlers. After the Battle of Boyds Creek and several violent incidents between the Cherokee and the settlers to the west in what is now Cocke County, the Cherokee were induced to sign the Treaty of Dumplin Creek in 1785, ceding what is now Sevier County to the State of Franklin.Treaty of Dumplin Creek, hmdb.orgThe Treaty of Dumplin Creek, loststate.weebly.com Among the first Euro-American settlers to move into the newly gained territory was Frederick Emert (1754‚Äì1829), who arrived with his family sometime between 1785 and 1793.Charles Elder and Randy Elder (editors), \\"Sevier County,\\" Goodspeed's History of East Tennessee (Nashville: Elder Book Publishers, 1972). Emert was born in Pennsylvania to German immigrants. He fought in the American Revolution for the Continental Army, and probably saw action at the Battle of Brandywine Creek. In 2000, the residents of Pittman Center erected the Emert's Cove Covered Bridge in his honor.Historical marker at the west end of Emert's Cove Covered Bridge Other settlers arrived in Emert's Cove with Emert in 1785. Among them was Johan Martin Shultz (1740-1787), a Revolutionary War surgeon that had served alongside Emert and John Sevier in the \\"Overmountain Men\\" in the Battle of King's Mountain. Shultz's son, Martin S.E. Shultz, would go on to marry Emert's daughter, Barbara Ann.H. Michael Shultz Jr., \\"From Brandenburg to Appalachia: The Shultz Family Story\\" Another important settler was Daniel Wesley Reagan (1803‚Äì1892), whose parents and grandparents were among the first settlers in what is now Gatlinburg.

The Pittman Community Center Pittman Community Center in 1938 In 1910, a survey of Tennessee found Sevier County to be most in need of educational facilities.Pearl Cashell Jackson, Pi Beta Phi Settlement School (University of Texas, 1927), 14. In spite of the establishment of a settlement school in Gatlinburg by the Pi Beta Phi fraternity in 1912, education in the region was still appallingly lacking. To help remedy this situation, Dr. John Burnett, a Methodist minister who visited the Smokies in 1919, envisioned the establishment a large-scale school in the area that would operate with virtually no tuition rates. Later that year, the Methodist Episcopal Church endorsed Burnett's plan at its annual meeting, and with the help of Reverend Eli Pittman of Elmira, New York, Burnett secured $15,000 for the project. In 1920, Burnett purchased Garfield Scott's farm just above the confluence of Webb Creek and the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River. This plot of land would become the core of the new school's campus.Margaret Ann Roth, \\"Pittman Center,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 3, no. 4 (September 1977): 5.

The buildings included a general store, post office, and a small hospital. The Pittman School supported itself by canning tomatoes and growing apples, with students doing all the maintenance work. In 1955, the Sevier County Board of Education purchased the Pittman School, and the school was combined with the Pi Beta Phi High School in Gatlinburg to form Gatlinburg-Pittman High School in 1963. The only building remaining from the Pittman school is the Home Economics building, which the Methodist Episcopal Church gave to the town after its incorporation for use as its city hall. In 1996, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Municipal incorporation In 1974 the community incorporated as the town of Pittman Center, which includes both the former Pittman Community Center campus and Emert's Cove.

Pittman Center spans most of Emert's Cove, which is located just north of the Greenbrier section of the Smokies. The cove cuts into Webb Mountain, a low ridge that runs roughly parallel to the national park boundary. The main section of Pittman Center, which includes its city hall and maintenance buildings, an elementary school, and Burnett Memorial Chapel, is situated just above the confluence of Webb Creek and the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon at the northern tip of the cove.

This mound was approximately high and across. An excavation in 1881 unearthed burial sites, arrowheads, a marble pipe, glass beads, pottery, and engraved objects.William Holmes, \\"Illustrated Catalogue of a Portion of the Collection Made During the Field Season of 1881.\\" Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1881-82 (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1884), 427-510.

At the time of this first excavation, the mound was located on a farm owned by the McMahan family, and was thus given the name \\"McMahan Indian Mound.\\" By the early 18th century, the Cherokee controlled much of the Tennessee side of the Smokies and had established a series of settlements along the Little Tennessee River. A section of the Great Indian Warpath forked at the mouth of Boyd's Creek, just north of Sevierville. The main branch crossed the French Broad and continued along Dumplin Creek to the Nolichucky basin in northeastern Tennessee. The other branch, known as the Tuckaleechee and Southeastern Trail, turned south along the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River. This second branch forked again at modern-day Pigeon Forge, with the main trail turning east en route to Little River and the other branch, known as Indian Gap Trail, crossing the crest of the Smokies to the south and descending into the Oconaluftee area of North Carolina.Robbie Jones, The Historic Architecture of Sevier County, Tennessee (Sevierville, Tenn.: Smoky Mountain Historical Society, 1997), 3-7. The various Cherokee trails crossing Sevier County brought the first Euro- American traders and settlers to the area. Early Euro-American settlement Plaque honoring Sevierville pioneer Spencer Clack at the Sevier County Courthouse European long hunters and traders arrived in the Sevierville area in the mid-18th century. Isaac Thomas (c. 1735‚Äì1818), the most notable of these early traders, was well respected by the Cherokee and may have lived at the Overhill town of Chota at one time.\\"Isaac Thomas & Elizabeth Massengill.\\" April 13, 2001.

Europeans like Thomas were mainly in the area in search of animal furs, which they exchanged for manufactured goods. As settlers began to trickle into East Tennessee, relations with the Cherokee began to turn hostile. During the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee, who had aligned themselves with the British, launched sporadic attacks against the sparse settlements in the Tennessee Valley. In December 1780, Col. John Sevier, fresh off a victory against the British at King's Mountain, launched a punitive expedition against the Cherokee. Sevier defeated the Cherokee at the Battle of Boyd's Creek and proceeded to destroy several Cherokee settlements along the Little Tennessee. A temporary truce secured by James White in 1783 led to an influx of Euro-American settlers in the French Broad valley.Goodspeed Publishing Company, \\"Sevier County .\\" History of Tennessee (1887), B32-35.

Hugh Henry (1756‚Äì1838) erected a small fort near the mouth of Dumplin Creek in 1782 known as Henry's Station. He was joined the following year by Samuel Newell (1754‚Äì1841), who established Newell's Station along Boyd's Creek, and Joshua Gist, who settled near the creek's mouth. Other early forts in the area included Willson's Station at the confluence of the East and Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon and Wear's Fort at the junction of the Southeastern and Tuckaleechee Trail and Indian Gap Trail.J.G.M. Ramsey, The Annals of Tennessee (Johnson City, Tenn.: Tennessee Overmountain Press, 1999), 369.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 3, 11. The Cherokee signed away all rights to what is now Sevier County in the 1785 Treaty of Dumplin Creek, which was negotiated at Henry's Station. In 1783, Isaac Thomas established a farm, trading post, and tavern at the confluence of the West Fork and the Little Pigeon River. He was joined shortly thereafter by Spencer Clack (1740‚Äì1832) and James McMahan, and a community known as \\"Forks of the Little Pigeon\\" developed around them. In 1789, Reverend Richard Wood (1756‚Äì1831) established Forks-of-the-River Baptist Church, which reported a congregation of 22 in 1790.

In 1792, Andrew Evans purchased a tract of land near the mouth of Boyd's Creek and built a ferry near the site of the old ford. In 1798, he sold the farm to John Brabson, and it became known as Brabson's Ferry Plantation. In the early 1790s, Thomas Buckingham established a large farm between Boyd's Creek and Sevierville. He went on to become the county's first sheriff. In the early 19th century, Timothy Chandler and his son, John Chandler (1786‚Äì1875), established the Wheatlands plantation in Boyd's Creek.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 14, 24. As towns situated along the French Broad are connected via waterway to New Orleans, flatboat trade flourished along the river in the early 19th century. In 1793, James Hubbert, who lived along Dumplin Creek, established Hubbert's Flat Landing to trade with flatboats moving up and down the river.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 17. In the early 19th century, Knoxville and Asheville were connected via Route 17, a crude road that followed the banks of the French Broad. This new road gave Tennessee's cattle drovers greater access to markets along the east coast. In 1820, a stagecoach road connected Sevierville with Maryville to the west.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 19. Sevierville's status as a county seat along these early roads helped it grow. By 1833, the town had a population of 150, including two doctors, two carpenters, a tanner, two tailors, a shoemaker, three stores, a hatter, two taverns, and two mills.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 21. Distilleries were popular means of supplemental income. By 1850, John Chandler's distillery was producing 6,000 gallons of whiskey per year.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 29. A notable late arrival in Sevierville was Dr. Robert H. Hodsden (1806‚Äì1864), who was an attending physician for the Trail of Tears. In 1846, Hodsden began construction on a plantation near Fair Garden, just outside Sevierville to the east. Known as Rose Glen, this plantation was worth $28,000 in 1860, making it one of the most valuable in the county.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 22, 29. In 1856, a fire swept through Sevierville, burning a recently constructed courthouse, 41 houses, and several shops in the downtown area. The county lost nearly all of the vital records of its early settlers.M.A. Rawlings, \\"Sevierville Fire of 1856,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 12, no. 4 (Winter of 1986), 95. The Civil War William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow delivers an anti-secession speech in Sevierville in 1861 Slavery was not common in Sevier County, although it did occur, especially at the large plantations along the French Broad River. Even before the American Civil War, Sevierville ‚Äì a hotbed of abolitionist activity ‚Äì was home to a relatively large community of free African-Americans.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 27. In 1861, only 3.8% of the residents of Sevier County voted in favor of secession from the Union.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 33. In late 1861, a pro-secession speech delivered by Henry Foote sparked an angry response in Sevierville and was followed by a series of explosive anti-secession speeches. The following year, pro-Union Knoxville newspaper editor Parson Brownlow gave a rousing anti-secession speech in Sevierville en route to a hideout in Wears Valley. Brownlow's audience remained gathered throughout the night after a rumor spread that Confederate forces were approaching.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 35. Union supporters in Sevier County were harassed and threatened throughout the war, even after Union forces under Ambrose Burnside occupied Knoxville in September 1863. Sevierville, situated at a major crossroads south of Knoxville, suffered consistent harassment, looting, and confiscation of property by both Union and Confederate forces moving through the town in 1863 and 1864. Vance Newman, a Union recruiting officer living in Sevierville at the time, later recalled: > A guard of rebel soldiers in 1864 threatened to burn my house, and the rebel > soldiers so often threatened to take my life that I cannot particularize. > They were always after me because of my Union sentiments.U.S. National > Archives Microfilm Publication P2257.

After Confederate General James Longstreet failed to retake Knoxville in the Battle of Fort Sanders, Union and Confederate forces quickly initiated a series of maneuvers to gain control of the strategic fords along the French Broad, culminating in an engagement near Hodsden's farm at Fair Garden in January 1864. Although the Union forces were victorious, they were later forced to retreat due to lack of supplies. A state of general anarchy ensued that continued until the end of the war. On October 30, 1864, Sevierville resident Terressa McCown wrote in her diary: > The robbers have come at last, they robbed my husband of his pocketbook, > money and papers and pocket knife.

Postwar-present House at 217 Cedar in Sevierville, designed by Lewis Buckner Sevierville recovered quickly from the war, with a number of new houses and businesses being built in the 1870s. Two members of the town's African-American community -- house builder Lewis Buckner (1856‚Äì1924) and brickmason Isaac Dockery (1832‚Äì1910) -- played a prominent role in Sevierville's post-war construction boom.

The group wore white hoods to conceal their identities and used Ku Klux Klan-like tactics, although they were not considered a racist entity. The Whitecaps initially threatened women accused of prostitution, and the group began launching nightly attacks in the mid-1890s. In 1893, Sevierville physician J.A. Henderson took over an anti-Whitecap group, which he renamed the \\"Blue Bills.\\" The two vigilante groups clashed at Henderson Springs in 1894, with deaths occurring on both sides. In 1896, the Whitecaps' murder of a young Sevierville couple led to widespread outrage, and in 1898, the Tennessee State Legislature banned \\"extra-legal conspiracies\\" and vigilante groups. Due to this measure and the efforts of Sevier County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Davis, the Whitecaps largely vanished by the end of the century.Jones, Historic Architecture of Sevier County, 63-64.

Geography  The confluence of the West Fork of the Little Pigeon River (left) and the Little Pigeon River (right) Sevierville is located at (35.878, -83.570). In the town's eastern section, the Little Pigeon River is formed by the confluence of its East Fork and Middle Fork, both of which flow down from their sources high in the Great Smoky Mountains. Five miles (8 km) downstream to the west, the Little Pigeon absorbs its West Fork before turning north and flowing for another five miles (8 km) to its mouth along the French Broad River. Sevierville is centered on the stretch of land between these two junctions of the East and Middle Fork and the West Fork, known traditionally as Forks-of-the-Pigeon or Forks-of-the- River. Situated in an area where the Foothills of the Great Smokies give way to the Tennessee Valley, Sevierville has long acted as a nexus between Knoxville to the north and the Appalachian towns in the mountains to the south. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is located approximately ten miles south of Sevierville. Due to its hilly terrain and the relatively poor roads of 19th-century Sevier County, a number of smaller communities developed independently along the outskirts of Sevierville. These include Harrisburg and Fair Garden to the east and Catlettsburg and Boyd's Creek to the north. In addition, the United States Postal Service associates the name \\"Sevierville\\" with ZIP codes for much of Sevier County, including the town of Pittman Center and other geographically extensive areas located outside Sevierville's city limits. Several major state and federal highways intersect in Sevierville. U.S. Route 441, commonly called \\"The Parkway,\\" connects Sevierville with Knoxville to the north and the national park and Cherokee, North Carolina, to the south. The Sevierville section of U.S. 441 has been named \\"Forks-of-the- River Parkway.\\" State Route 66, also called Winfield Dunn Parkway, connects Sevierville with Interstate 40 to the north. U.S. Route 411 traverses Sevierville from east to west, connecting Sevierville with Blount and Cocke counties. State Route 416 connects Sevierville with Pittman Center and U.S. Route 321 at the park boundary to the southeast.

The population was 2,569 at the 2000 census and 11,517 at the 2010 census, for a gain of 348.3% during the decade.

History Arlington has been called Shelby County's best-kept secret, as it has remained a small quiet rural town for two centuries. Settlers came to the area in the 1830s, and many of their descendants still live in the town. Originally known as Haysville, the town was named after the original landowner, Samuel Jackson Hays, a nephew of President Andrew Jackson. The area began to grow with the development of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad and the creation of Withe Depot within its boundaries. By 1856, about 200 people called Haysville home. The outbreak of yellow fever in Memphis in 1878 contributed to the stagnant population as the town fathers quarantined the area, forbidding outsiders from entering the town. The town was incorporated as Haysville in 1878. In 1883 the town's name was changed to Arlington due to the post office being unable to use the name Haysville. In 1900 the town was incorporated again. Captain Henry Pittman, who lived in Haysville, had visited Washington, D.C. and Arlington National Cemetery and was inspired to call the town Arlington. The economic crash of 1929 led to a small economic depression in the town, but Arlington's economy gradually grew out of it due to the major change of highway 70 opening the town to outside businesses.

It had been officially incorporated on November 1, 1866, with a population of less than 100 under the inaugural mayorship of Bryan Wither. The city derived its name from Major Gabriel M. Bartlett, a planter and pioneer settler of the area, whose homeplace was located on the old Raleigh- Somerville Road (Stage Road) at the present location of Bartlett Station Plaza.

The population was 38,844 at the 2010 census. Germantown is a suburb of Memphis, bordering it to the east-southeast. Germantown's economy is dominated by the retail and commercial service sectors; there is no heavy industry in Germantown. In the city center is the \\"Old Germantown\\" neighborhood, anchored by a railroad depot (a 1948 reproduction of the 1868 original) and railroad tracks that recall the community's earliest days of development as an outpost along the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. The city hosts many horse shows and competitions annually, most notably the Germantown Charity Horse Show in June. Other major annual events include the Germantown Festival, an arts and crafts fair, in early September. Germantown has the lowest crime rate for any city its size in the State of Tennessee and the police and fire departments have average emergency response time of five minutes (police just under 4 minutes & fire department 5.2 minutes). The parks and recreation department is nationally accredited. The Arbor Day Foundation has designated Germantown a \\"Tree City USA\\" for 23 consecutive years.City of Germantown - FY15 Budget Page 18 Only 3.2% of Germantown citizens are below the poverty line. Geography Germantown is located at (35.089023, ‚àí89.793997). It is part of the Memphis metropolitan area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water. History Germantown was founded along the Chickasaw Trace on a ridge between the Wolf River and Nonconnah Creek, about 16 miles east of the Mississippi River. The first white settlers arrived in Germantown about 1825. Between 1825 and 1830, Miss Frances Wright established Nashoba Plantation, a utopian community intended to educate emancipated slaves and teach them a trade. By 1830, the first store was opened as more settlers moved into the area. The community became known as Pea Ridge in 1833. Town lots were laid out in 1834 by surveyor N. T. German. The name was changed to Germantown in 1836. This coincidentally also reflected the settling of German families. The town was incorporated in 1841. The Memphis- Charleston Railroad was built through the community in 1852. Germantown experienced setbacks through the period of the Civil War (1861-1865); the yellow fever epidemics reduced its population to a few hundred. The town rebounded slowly. Churches destroyed in the war were rebuilt, schools were constructed and the population began to return around the turn of the century. The city name was briefly changed to Neshoba, a Chickasaw word meaning 'wolf', during World War I, because of widespread anti-German sentiment in the United States at that time. During the twentieth century, the community derived its strength through involvement of citizens, as evidenced in the churches, garden clubs and civic organizations. The Poplar Pike Improvement Association and the Germantown Civic Club played vital roles in the physical and social development of the community. In the last half of the century, after WWII the population grew from about 400 to more than 40,000. Over several decades, elected and civic leadership, with support of citizens, worked proactively to control suburban growth through development regulations, aesthetic controls and strategic planning efforts.City of Germantown Web Site http://www.germantown-tn.gov/gcsearch.aspx?q=history  Historical Sites  \\"Old Germantown\\" is centered around the railroad depot in downtown Germantown on Germantown Road. This was chosen as a central location by settlers in the late 19th century due to its high ground and central location. The depot was rebuilt in 1948 to replace the original structure from 1868. The depot is now home to the Germantown Train Museum. There are signs to commemorate historical sites and parks in \\"Old Germantown.\\" Fort Germantown, located on Honey Tree Drive off of Poplar Pike is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It was at this site that 250 Union Soldiers built their fortification from the ground in order to guard the Memphis and Charleston railroad during the Civil War. Now, there are replicas of Howitzer cannons to mark the fort. The John Gray House, located in Municipal Park, built prior to 1851 is one of the oldest brick homes in Shelby County. Originally located in Eads, TN, it was moved to Germantown in 1989 to prevent demolition. Government The City of Germantown operates under a Mayor-Alderman form of government. The mayor and five aldermen are elected for four year terms and are part-time positions. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen is the legislative and policy-making body of the City. The mayor does not vote except to break a tie.

As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 10,176. Millington was granted the title \\"Flag City Tennessee\\" by the Tennessee State Legislature. The Naval Support Activity Mid-South is located at the former Memphis Naval Air Station, which was changed functions from a training base to an administrative one in 1993. There is also a general aviation airport that features the third longest runway in Tennessee. Geography Millington is at (35.336566, ‚àí89.902132). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.13%, is water. The city is located in the Memphis Metropolitan Area, about north of Memphis. The metropolitan area OF MEMPHIS has a population of approximately 1.2 million people. Millington is close to the Meeman-Shelby Forest State Park, Fort Pillow State Park, and the Mississippi River. History The book Millington, the First Hundred Years by Faye Ellis Osteen (compiled of many stories that can not be proven fact or fictions, relies on individual witnesses and stories handed down by local families) and published by the Millington Centennial Committee outlines the history of Millington from its beginnings to the present. In 1878, Mr. and Mrs. George Millington donated a large area of land to a group of settlers for the purpose of starting a town. Mr. Millington requested that the new town be named in his honor. In 1888 the First Baptist Church was founded. It has over 5000 members. Its church is one of the largest buildings in Millington. In 1890, the first industry came to town. Since that time job growth has been sporadic and unfocused. Millington was officially chartered by the State of Tennessee in 1903. In 1917 the US military began its initial presence in Millington. Park Field was established as a pilot training facility. With the conclusion of World War I in 1918, military pilot training ceased. It was not until 1942, with the outbreak of World War II that the military would renew its interest in Millington. In 1928 Millington Telephone was established. This business brought modern communications to Millington and the surrounding region. At the outset of World War II the US Navy established the current airport as a training facility for Navy pilots. Consistently for many decades over 15,000 military personnel were assigned to Millington. The Navy brought prosperity to the community on an ongoing basis. In the 1980s the Base Realignment and Closure Commission began the process of downsizing the Millington Navy facility. Flight training was moved out of Millington. However, all US Navy personnel functions were relocated to the community. At present the military and associated private contracting creates a $335 million annual economic benefit to the region. In 1986 USA Stadium was developed by Mr. W. S. \\"Babe\\" Howard. This sporting facility brought recognition to Millington. International baseball was played here. The Stadium continues to be an economic asset for the community. In 1993 the Millington Regional Jetport was opened as a general aviation airport. It currently is the backup airport for Federal Express, or FedEx. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 10,176 people, 3,814 households, and 2,699 families residing in the city. The population density was 321.7 people per square mile (258.7/km2). There were 4,408 housing units at an average housing density of 258.2 per square mile (99.7/2).

Naval Support Activity Mid-South Aerial view of the Naval Air Station Memphis in the mid-1940s Millington is home to the Naval Support Activity Mid-South (NAVSUPPACT) naval station, one of the largest single employers in the state of Tennessee, with more than 7,500 military, civilian, and contractor employees on . The naval base hosts many tenant organizations, notably the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS). Formerly known as the Naval Air Station (NAS) Memphis, a major technical training center for the United States Navy and Marine Corps comprising over , the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission report resulted in significant changes to the base's mission and its re-designation in 1995 as the Naval Support Activity Memphis. The airfield was turned over to the city of Millington, which is now the Millington Regional Jetport. In 1998, the name of the naval air station was changed to Naval Support Activity Mid-South to better reflect its current mission and the Navy's approach to regionalization. Many military retirees, who live in and around Millington in order to have access to base facilities, contribute to the local economy. This site was originally established in November 1917 as Park Field, an Army Signal Corps Aviation School used to train pilots for service with the Allied Forces during World War I. By February 1918, flight operations were in full swing, but only until November of that year when the Armistice was signed. Two days after the signing, training operations were ceased. At that time the airfield began pioneering airmail routes throughout Tennessee and the surrounding states. In March 1920, the government officially purchased Park Field. However, the airfield continued to decline until it was little more than a storage area for aircraft and parts. Ironically, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 breathed new life into Park Field. During the 1930s the field served as a transient camp for unemployed workers. In 1937 the Resettlement Administration took over the land and developed model farms used to demonstrate what could be achieved with correctly managed land. Park Field remained under this agency's jurisdiction until the outbreak of World War II. Just as the onset of World War I had given Park Field its birth in 1917, the declaration of war on December 8, 1941, had similar results, heralding the arrival of naval aviation to the Memphis area. In February 1942, the Navy Shore Station Development Board recommended approval of a reserve aviation base on the former site of Park Field. The Naval Training Station was commissioned along with the Naval Reserve Aviation Base in 1942. On January 1, 1943 the name was changed from Naval Reserve Aviation Base to Naval Air Station Memphis. The main role of Naval Air Station Memphis was to provide aviation maintenance and pilot training. During this period of time more than 20,000 students were trained annually. Pilot training for Student Naval Aviators was discontinued after World War II, but NAS Memphis continued to thrive as home of Naval Air Technical Training Center Memphis (NATTC Memphis), providing initial and advanced technical training to various aviation operations, aviation maintenance and aviation support specialities coded under Navy enlisted aviation ratings and Marine Corps enlisted aviation Military Occupational Specialities. Training activities by these \\"A\\" Schools and \\"C\\" Schools at NATTC Memphis continued until 1993 when BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure Commission) recommended that the training schools under NATTC transfer to NAS Pensacola, Florida and occupy spaces being vacated by the former Naval Aviation Depot Pensacola (NADEP Pensacola) that was also being closed by BRAC action. During the same time period BRAC also recommended that BUPERS (Bureau of Naval Personnel) move from Virginia to Millington.

The population was 2,306 at the 2010 census. It is located on the Cumberland River, which was important to its early development. It is likely best known as the hometown of former Vice President and Senator Al Gore of the Democratic Party and his father, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. The younger Gore announced his 1988 and 2000 presidential bids, as well as his 1992 vice-presidential bid, from the steps of the Smith County Courthouse. History The earliest known European-American settler in what is now Carthage was William Walton (1760‚Äì1816), who arrived in the late 1780s after the United States achieved independence in the American Revolutionary War.\\"The History of Smith County\\", Smith County Chamber of Commerce, Retrieved: 17 January 2013. Circa 1800, Walton directed the construction of the Walton Road (Cumberland Turnpike), an early stagecoach route connecting the Knoxville area in the east with Middle Tennessee. The road, which was roughly paralleled later by the construction of what is now U.S. 70, was influential to the development and early settlement of the Cumberland region.W. Calvin Dickenson, \\"Walton Road\\", The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 17 January 2013. Walton operated a ferry across the Cumberland River and a tavern nearby along the road, around which a small community developed. In 1804, Walton's community was chosen as the county seat of the newly formed Smith County after a heated election, and the town of Carthage was laid out shortly thereafter.Sue Maggart, \\"Smith County\\", The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 17 January 2013. Carthage's location at the confluence of the Caney Fork and Cumberland rivers made it an important shipping and steamboat port throughout the first half of the 19th century. The area was developed for tobacco and hemp crops, as well as blooded livestock. Goods were shipped downstream to Nashville. During the Civil War, Carthage became an important post in the Eastern Highland Rim area of Tennessee. Carthage was selected as part of the route Confederate General Braxton Bragg marched the Army of Mississippi through on his Confederate Heartland Offensive into Kentucky. Later on March 6, 1863,Official Record of the War of the Rebellion, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part II, No. 110 Union Brigadier General George Crook established a Union outpost in Carthage to serve as a base for his effort to clear out the considerable Confederate guerrilla insurgency from East Tennessee through Middle Tennessee.

During a major expedition into East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, a Union Army unit attacked Confederate troops at Blountville. The town was shelled in the fighting and the courthouse was burned in the battle, which forced the Confederates to withdraw. The courthouse was rebuilt within the old walls in 1866. The current courthouse dates from a major construction that was done in 1920; it also includes additions made in 1958. If Blountville were an incorporated town, it would qualify as the second oldest municipality in Tennessee (second only to Jonesborough); however, it was unincorporated at one point in order to avoid having redundant government services for such a small area and population. This unique status has led to some odd results, including a lawsuit in which it was ruled that neighboring Kingsport was not allowed to annex areas of Sullivan County within a defined distance of the courthouse, in effect ensuring that the county seat could not be annexed out of existence.

The population was 30,278 at the 2010 census and 42,918 in 2019. Named for U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, the city was established on the Cumberland River and made the county seat of Sumner County in 1802. It is located about 30.6 miles northeast of the state capital of Nashville, Tennessee. Several national companies have facilities or headquarters in Gallatin, including Gap, Inc., RR Donnelley, Beretta and Servpro Industries, Inc. Gallatin was formerly the headquarters of Dot Records. The city is also the site of Volunteer State Community College, a two-year college with more than 70 degree programs. In 2017, Gallatin was named \\"The Nicest Place In America\\" by Reader's Digest. History Gallatin was established in 1802 as the permanent county seat of Sumner County, Tennessee, in what is called the Middle Tennessee region. The town was named after Albert Gallatin, Secretary of Treasury to Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Andrew Jackson became one of the first to purchase a lot when the town was surveyed and platted in 1803. The town was built around a traditional plan of an open square. Jackson founded the first general store in Gallatin.Sumner County Fact Book 2007‚Äì2008. The News Examiner & The Hendersonville Star News. 2007. In 1803, the first county courthouse and jail were built on the central town square. In 1815, the town was incorporated. In the mid-20th century, it operated under a charter established by a 1953 Private Act of the State Legislature. During the secession crisis just before the American Civil War, the citizens of Gallatin hoped to remain neutral; they were opposed to secession from the Union. Once the fighting began, however, they gave almost unanimous support to the Confederacy and volunteered to serve in defense of their state. The Union Army captured Gallatin in February 1862, following Ulysses S. Grant's capture of Fort Donelson. Gallatin was strategic because of the railroad and its location on the Cumberland River, both of which the Union Army sought to control. In July 1862, General John Hunt Morgan recaptured Gallatin and held it until the Confederate forces fell back to Chattanooga in October. In November 1862, Union General Eleazar A. Paine retook the town, and Union troops occupied it throughout the remainder of the war. Paine was notoriously cruel and was replaced in command before the end of the war because of his behavior. Alice Williamson, a 16-year-old girl, kept a diary during this time and described Paine's execution of alleged spies in the town square.Alice Williamson Diary, Duke University Special Collections Library, accessed October 11, 2007 Following the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, enslaved African Americans left plantations with their families to join the Union troops. They established a \\"contraband camp\\" at Gallatin. The slaves were provided food and housing, and put to work. Schools were set up in the camp so that both adults and children could learn to read and write.John F. Baker, Jr., The Washingtons of Wessyngton Plantation: Stories of My Family's Journey to Freedom, New York: Atria Books, 2009, p. 185 The long enemy occupation drained the area of resources. Union troops lived off the land, confiscating livestock and crops from local farms. By the end of the war, widespread social and economic breakdown and dislocation existed in the area, accompanied by a rise in crime. Occupation forces of the Union Army remained in Gallatin for some time after the war, still living off the land.Durham, Walter T. Rebellion Revisited: A History of Sumner County, Tennessee from 1861 to 1870, Franklin, Tennessee: Hillsboro Press, 1999, 2nd edition) In the aftermath of the war, many freedmen moved from the farms into town, to gather in black communities away from white oversight. At the same time, many white residents moved from town out to farms to avoid the occupying troops. The area took many years to recover from the disruption of the war years. Its continued reliance on agriculture slowed the economy, and planters and other employers struggled with the shift to a free labor system. In summer 1873, Gallatin was devastated by an epidemic of cholera. In the single month of June, 68 people died, including many children.\\"Gallatin Sexton Records for the Year 1873\\", Rootsweb, accessed May 13, 2008 The epidemic swept through the South, with the disease brought by immigrants arriving in New Orleans, and spread by passengers traveling in the region by steamboat and rail. The poor sanitation of the period resulted in contamination of water sources. Sumner County had an estimated 120 deaths that year from cholera, with four-fifths of them suffered by African Americans.John M. Woodworth, \\"The Cholera Epidemic of 1873 in the United States\\", Sumner County, pp. 159-163. Reports Prepared Under the Direction of the Surgeon-General of the Army. Nashville had 603 fatal cases from June 7 to 29, with 72 people dying on the day of highest fatalities.J. C. Peters, M.D., \\"The South Western Cholera: 1873\\", The Sanitarian, September 1873, National Institutes of Health exhibit, accessed May 13, 2008 Gradually through the late 19th century, Gallatin and its surroundings regained some steady growth. The area was primarily agricultural until the middle of the 20th century. By 1970, industrialization and urbanization had resulted in half the county population being considered urban (including suburbs). In 1992, Gallatin was surpassed by Hendersonville as the largest city in the county, though the former remains the county seat. Today, it serves in part as a bedroom commuter suburb to the larger city and state capital of Nashville, some 30 miles to the southwest. On April 7, 2006, a tornado struck the city, killing nine people and injuring 150. Volunteer State Community College sustained major damage. This tornado was part of the April 6‚Äì8, 2006 Tornado Outbreak.

The population was 189 at the 2010 census, down from 207 in 2000. History Mitchellville began with the establishment of a farm by Ezekiel Marshall in 1814. The community that developed around the farm was originally known as Mitchell's Cross Roads after Hiram Mitchell, who owned land near the intersection of two early roads. With the arrival of the railroad in 1859, the name of the community was changed to Mitchellville Station. The city incorporated in 1909, and thrived as a railroad stop throughout the first half of the 20th century. The city began to decline as rail traffic decreased in the 1950s, however, and never fully recovered from a destructive tornado in 1955.Jennifer Easton, \\"Mitchellville Fights Against Obscurity,\\" The Tennessean, 1 December 2014.

The population was 11,486 in 2010 according estimates by the U.S. census bureau and in 2019 the population was 13,030. Portland is a part of the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Portland is located on the Highland Rim in extreme northern Middle Tennessee. This region has always been known for excellent agricultural soils, a spectacular wildlife environment and an enjoyable climate. People were originally attracted from the tobacco belt in Virginia and the Carolinas to the Highland Rim for land speculation and production of dark tobacco. The Highland Rim offered ideal climate and soil conditions for growing dark tobacco. This lucrative crop increased the value of the land, which benefited land speculators in the area. Eventually these speculators moved on to attempt profits elsewhere. The farmers, however, remained. The oldest local settlement in Portland is Fountain Head, which is located a couple of miles south of Portland. This settlement was founded 1792 by the James Gwin family. Within a century, it grew to include a mill, tobacco factory, post office, a Louisville and Nashville Railroad depot, and a number of local retail stores. William Nolan built a school near Shun Pike in what is now Portland. This stimulated community growth. Portland was originally called Richland. In 1859, the L&N; Railroad opened the Nashville-Bowling Green route through Portland. In the same year, a train depot was built in Richland along the railroad on property owned by Thomas Buntin. Buntin was appointed as the depot's first agent and later became Richland's first postmaster. The depot stimulated development in the village. Even today, the railroad runs directly through the center of town. The first public high school in Sumner County was originally started as a seminary in 1874. It was later named Sumner County High School and opened in 1915. In 1887, there were two towns in Tennessee named Richland. Officials of the L&N; railroad were worried that a telegraph mix-up might result in a train wreck. Postal customers complained of inconvenience as mail was frequently misdirected between the two Richlands. The Railroad administrators and postal authorities decided that Richland in Sumner County would be renamed as Portland to avoid this confusion. The new name was effective on April 10, 1888. Portland was incorporated in April 1904 by legislation passed by the Tennessee Assembly. In the second decade of the 21st century, Portland is growing at a fast pace buoyed by the growth of the Nashville Metropolitan Area. Daido America operates its US headquarters in Portland.

Smith, Sr. who gave the initial five acres for the Depot grounds. The new town was named for Mr. Bright, the first conductor on the Memphis Division of the said road. The new town grew quickly. By the late 1870s, Brighton had two dry goods stores, three grocery stores, two saloons, two blacksmith shops, two wagon shops, one brick yard, one steam saw and grist mill, one steam cotton gin, a Baptist church, two physicians, and a population of approximately 100. In 1883, the veterans of the 7th Tennessee Cavalry, Confederate States of America made Brighton the permanent site of their annual reunion. At Brighton, the veterans reunion took on new dimensions and it grew into a reunion of all Confederate veterans of Tipton County and the surrounding region. Over the years, attendance of this annual August event grew, peaking at 15,000 in 1897. The Tipton County Confederate Veterans Reunion, as it came to be known, continued to be held at Brighton until 1940. Brighton was incorporated by the Tennessee General Assembly in 1913 and the town today continues to operate under the same charter.

Retrieved: 6 December 2013. Located northeast of Memphis, Covington is part of the Memphis, Tennessee Metropolitan Area. History The Covington area was originally inhabited by Native Americans of various tribes. They used the nearby Mississippi River as a trading route among numerous American Indian nations, who for more than 1,000 years conducted continent-deep trading between the upper river and the Southeast. Evidence of such trading has been found in materials and items excavated from numerous archeological sites. Tipton County is one of five present-day counties of the State of Tennessee that border the Mississippi River. The first Europeans to explore this area were attached to the noted expedition of the French Canadians Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet in 1673. This expedition went down the Mississippi from present-day Wisconsin to the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then back upriver to Lake Michigan. The Arkansas River represents part of the border between present-day Arkansas and Mississippi. It is likely that de Soto and his men passed near here circa 1541. During the 19th century, because this entire area consists of fertile floodplains and a climate of long, hot summers, and adequate rainfall, the Covington area and the rest of West Tennessee were developed for cotton plantations. This became the primary commodity crop across the South in the 19th century, generating great wealth for many large planters. African- American slaves were brought to Western Tennessee by planters relocating here, or forced here by sale in the domestic slave trade. West Tennessee was the center of large-scale slavery in Tennessee, and Memphis had a major slave market. Planters and farmers in Middle Tennessee also held slaves, although in fewer number. Farmers in the eastern part of the state mostly developed small subsistence farms and held few slaves. During the Civil War, Union Army and Union Navy fought to gain control of strategic areas along the Mississippi River in order to control its traffic and split the Confederate States in two. The Confederate Army resisted, but the Union Army defeated and occupied forces in Tipton and other counties of Tennessee and northeastern Arkansas. The war ended early in the Covington area, and Tennessee was occupied by Union forces from 1862. Starting in the 1870s during the Reconstruction era, the state legislature supported railroad construction in the region, to improve transporting crops to market. The Memphis and Paducah Railroad completed its tracks to Covington in July 1873. The first telegraph line between Memphis and Covington was completed in 1882. In 1894, electric power was installed in Covington. The city established a municipal water system in 1898 to provide residents with pure drinking water. Twentieth-century improvements included street paving in 1922. Since 1929, a natural gas company has operated to provide cooking gas and wintertime heating to homes and business in Covington. The time that telephone service was installed in Covington is not known. Following the invention of the automobile, during the 1910s and 1920s the United States began to construct more intercity paved highways in various regions of the county. These developed into the U.S. Numbered Highway System, and U.S. Route 51 was established. This highway connects Memphis and points south with Chicago, via Covington and Cairo, Illinois. Covington is a small town with access to a major north-south highway of commerce and travel. Both black and white tenant farmers and sharecroppers in West Tennessee struggled with poverty as a result of lower cotton prices during the Great Depression, which added to social tensions between ethnic groups. Whites maintained their political supremacy, having disenfranchised most blacks at the turn of the 20th century. After an armed altercation during a July 1937 police raid on an illegal gambling site, Albert Gooden was arrested as a suspect in the death of a sheriff's deputy. Because of lynching threats, the sheriff took the African- American man to be held in custody in Memphis. A month later, when the sheriff was secretly transporting Gooden back to Covington to stand trial, his car was stopped on an isolated road. Masked men took Gooden away. His body was found the next day, half in the river and shot more than 30 times. The governor offered a $5000 reward, but no one was prosecuted for the lynching. Gooden was the first man to be lynched in Tipton County since the late 19th century; his was one of several lynchings in the nation that year. It was covered by The New York Times and other major newspapers.Abayomi Azikiwe, \\"Two Case Studies in Race Terror During the Great Depression in Southwest Tennessee\\", Pambana Journal, Winter 1998, Wayne State University The South Main Historic District in Covington includes about 50 houses from the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, along with commercial structures of historic interest.

History The town of Erwin received its name by a mail mishap. On December 5, 1879, the name of the town was Ervin, in honor of D.J.N. Ervin, who had donated of land for the county seat. A typo made by post office officials caused the name to be recorded as Erwin. The mistake was never corrected. Erwin earned some notoriety in 1916 when the only known public execution of an elephant in Tennessee occurred in the community.http://blueridgecountry.com/archive/favorites/mary-the- elephant/http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/murderous-mary-1916/ Mary, an elephant in Sparks World Famous Shows traveling circus, had killed her handler, Walter Eldridge, in nearby Kingsport after the inexperienced trainer allegedly struck Mary on the head with a hook. News of a killer elephant spread via rumors and sensationalist news stories, and calls for Mary's execution began. Some towns announced they would turn the circus away if it showed up with the elephant. So Mary's owner, Charlie Sparks, decided to execute Mary by hanging in order to appease the crowds. Erwin was a little more than 35 miles south of Kingsport, and as home to the region's largest railway yard they happened to have a 100-ton crane car that could lift the five-ton elephant. Surrounding communities decided that Erwin was the best place to carry out the execution and Erwin obliged, even though the town itself was against it. An estimated 2,500 people turned out at the local railway yard to see Mary hoisted by a crane to meet her demise. Playwright George Brant won the 2008 Keene Prize for Literature for his a one-act play titled ‚ÄúElephant‚Äôs Graveyard‚Äù, depicting this story. The town has recently implemented a yearly festival to help raise funds that go exclusively to The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald.

Jonesborough is part of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area - commonly known as the \\"Tri-Cities\\" region. History Jonesborough was founded in 1779, 17 years before Tennessee became a state and while the area was under the jurisdiction of North Carolina. It was named after North Carolina legislator, Willie Jones, who had supported the state's westward expansion across the Appalachian Mountains.\\"Historic Jonesborough - A Little History; Jonesborough.com; retrieved 5-1-2008. Jonesborough Historic District The town was renamed \\"Jonesboro\\" for a period of time, but it has been changed back to the original spelling. Jonesborough was originally a part of the Washington District. In 1784, it became the capital of the autonomous State of Franklin (ostensibly named after American founding father, Benjamin Franklin). Congress, however, never recognized Franklin, which was re-claimed by North Carolina in late 1788. Jonesborough is often considered to be the center of the abolitionist movement within the states that would join the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Elihu Embree printed his publication, The Emancipator, from Jonesborough. Publication began in 1820, making The Emancipator the first American periodical to be dedicated exclusively to the issue of the abolition of slavery. While Tennessee would later join the Confederacy, most east Tennesseans had Unionist leanings. They were generally subsistence farmers and held relatively few slaves compared to landowners in Middle Tennessee or the plantation areas of the Delta near the Mississippi River. In the 1840s, Jonesborough became the second hometown to the Jonesborough Whig, a newspaper published by William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, after Brownlow relocated the paper from Elizabethton, Tennessee, where it had been in publication for approximately two years. Brownlow and rival editor/Methodist circuit rider Landon Carter Haynes brawled in the streets of Jonesborough in May 1840. Over the next several years, the two newspapermen bashed one another in their respective papers, each managing at times to thwart the other's political ambitions. Haynes left the newspaper business in 1845, and Brownlow, who later was elected as governor, moved the Whig to Knoxville in 1849.James Bellamy, \\"The Political Career of Landon Carter Haynes,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 28 (1956), pp. 105-107. Modern tourism The Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough. Today, Jonesborough attracts heritage tourism because of its historical status as Tennessee's oldest town and its significant historic preservation efforts that have preserved a rich architectural fabric. The town's museum describes the local heritage of tobacco farming. The historic Chester Inn, built in 1797, still stands in downtown Jonesborough. The Jonesborough Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The oldest surviving building, the Christopher Taylor House (built in 1777 about a mile outside of the original town limits), was relocated to a lot within the historic district. Jonesborough is the home to the International Storytelling Center, which holds the annual National Storytelling Festival on the first full weekend in October. The festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling, and has been drawing people from around the world for more than 35 years. Large tents are pitched in parks around town, and storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the main tent to perform. Occasionally, performances are interrupted for a moment by passing Norfolk Southern Railway trains. Past storytellers included Carmen Agra Deedy, Syd Lieberman, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival inspired the development of a successful storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.Storytelling Degree information; East Tennessee State University online. Geography Jonesborough is situated in an area where the watershed of the Watauga River meets the watershed of the Nolichucky River.

Local legends The Christopher Taylor House, built c. 1777 A local legend holds that the ghost of Andrew Jackson occasionally appears in the vicinity of a historic cabin in a town park. In 1788, future U.S. president Jackson spent several months in Jonesborough awaiting a caravan. During this time, he lodged in a cabin belonging to Major Christopher Taylor, which was located about a mile outside of town. In 1974, this cabin was removed from its original spot and reconstructed in the town's park. The ghost supposedly walks up to the front door and disappears into the building. The ghost has also been reportedly seen walking down the street, in the direction of the old courthouse.\\"The Christopher Taylor House\\" ; Haunt Masters; Haunted Jonesborough; by Charles Edwin Price; retrieved 5-1-2008.

While the railroad, which intersected the L&N; system at Iron City, was originally to extend northward to Hohenwald, plans for extension beyond Collinwood never materialized, and the city became the railroad's western terminus.Richard Quin and Miranda Roche, National Register of Historic Places Inventory Form for Collinwood Railroad Station, September 1987, Sec. 8, pp. 1-4.Bob Rains, \\"Wayne County,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Accessed 9 November 2016. The Collinwood Land Company advertised lots for the new city in June 1913, and by the following year, about 300 people were living in the city. Most of the residents worked for the railroad or in the local lumber industry. During World War I, Collinwood's economy boomed, and its population swelled to over 2,000. A wood alcohol (methanol) distillation plant and blast furnace were constructed in the years following the war, but as demand for these products fell, the economy collapsed and the city began to decline. The tracks connecting Collinwood with the L&N; system were abandoned in the late 1930s. The Collinwood Railroad Station, built in 1916, still stands near the city of the city, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The station, which mostly follows design patterns typical of L&N; depots of the period, is the last major remnant of the area's railroad history. The station now serves as a library and museum.

The Sparta Rock House Sparta nearly became the capital of the state of Tennessee, as, early in the history of Tennessee, the state legislature voted to choose a location for the permanent state capital. The final vote resulted in a near tie between Sparta and Nashville. Sparta lost to Nashville by one vote. Sparta grew quickly due to its location along the stage road between Knoxville and Nashville. In the 1830s, brothers Barlow and Madison Fisk built the Sparta Rock House, which served as an inn along the stage road. The Rock House, strategically situated in an area where the Cumberland Plateau gives way to the Calfkiller valley, was a common stopover for figures important to the early history of the state, including Andrew Jackson and Sam Houston.Tennessee Historical Commission marker 2D 35 on US-70 in Sparta, Tennessee.

The population was 5,861 at the 2010 census. It was established in 1797 by William Nolen, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. Located in Middle Tennessee, it is approximately twenty-two miles southeast of Nashville. The town was re- incorporated in 1996. Geography Nolensville is located at (35.956786, -86.666967). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History This area was settled by European Americans after the American Revolutionary War, when pioneers began to move west of the Appalachian Mountains. William Nolen, a war veteran, his wife, Sarah, and their five children were passing through the area in 1797 when their wagon wheel broke. Surveying his surroundings, Nolen noted the rich soil and abundance of natural resources. He decided to settle here and the community was later named for him as Nolensville.History, Town of Nolensville website, accessed July 8, 2011 William Nolen purchased a portion of a land grant made to Jason Thompson, on which Nolensville later developed. Nolen's historic house was moved to a new location in 2009. In the early 19th century, a large migration from Rockingham, North Carolina, brought the Adams, Allen, Barnes, Cyrus, Fields, Glenn, Irion, Johnson, Peay, Scales, Taylor, Vernon, Wisener, Williams, and other families to the area. Built along Mill Creek, the town was incorporated in 1839. Foraging and skirmishing took place here during the Civil War. Gen. John Wharton's Confederate cavalry unit was stationed in town briefly and Gen. Joseph Wheeler's command captured a Union supply train here on December 30, 1862. A small group of soldiers from the 2nd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry successfully defended a Union wagon train against a much larger Confederate cavalry force in February 1863, with several of them earning the Medal of Honor for their actions.Home of the Brave From the post- Reconstruction period into the early 20th century, whites lynched a total of five African Americans in Williamson County. They did not allow the legal system to prosecute these men, but conducted extra-judicial murder.Lynching in America/ Supplement: Lynchings by County , Equal Justice Initiative, 2015, p. 6 Among the victims was 15-year-old Samuel Smith, an African American who was lynched in Nolensville in December 1924. He was arrested there for shooting and wounding Ike Eastwood at his house, after Eastwood shot Smith's uncle; the grocer also shot and wounded Smith. Smith was taken for treatment to a hospital in Nashville. A group of masked men took him from the hospital and, with a larger mob, back 22 miles to Nolensville. There the mob hanged the youth near Eastwood's house and shot him multiple times. Although the Nashville Chamber of Commerce offered a $5000 reward in the case, no one was convicted of Smith's murder. On June 5, 2017, a plaque was installed in his memory at St. Anselm Episcopal Church in Nashville, Tennessee; it memorialized two other local lynching victims as well.

The population was 1,229 at the 2010 census. History Two theories are given as to how Frankston got its name. The one most accepted (and shown on the city's official website) is that Frankston was named for Frankie Miller, a young woman who donated land for the downtown city park. An alternate theory for the name of the town was that Frankston was named after Frank Miller, who owned the land when the railway was built. The Miller house still stands as a historical landmark in the southeast part of town, on ACR 19. The state bought the land from him and named the city in his honor.

Economic development Andrews is a city built on oil and soil. After the first oil well was drilled (1929) by Deep Rock Oil Company on Missourian Charles E. Ogden's property, Andrews County became one of the major oil-producing counties in Texas, having produced in excess of of oil. The cyclical nature of the oil business (as well as diminishing production on existing wells), though, has caused the community to look into new means of economic development, such as waste disposal, which in some areas has caused controversy. Waste Control Specialists (WCS), owned by Harold Simmons and headquartered in Dallas, Texas, operates a site in Andrews County on the border with New Mexico. The company was awarded a license to dispose of radioactive waste by the TCEQ in 2009. The permit allows for disposal of radioactive materials such as uranium, plutonium and thorium from commercial power plants, academic institutions, and medical schools.https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/texas-site-begins-taking-federal- nuclear-waste-19343196#.UblWMfk3vg0 The company finished construction on the project in 2011 and started disposing of waste in 2012. Two radioactive waste landfills are at the site. The 30-acre compact site is owned and regulated by the State of Texas for use by Texas, Vermont, and up to 36 other states. The 90-acre federal site is owned by the United States federal government and is used for Department of Energy and other federal waste. The company employs 130 people or about 1% of the total labor force in Andrews. For years, a dispute has been simmering concerning to which state these waste sites belong: Texas or New Mexico? The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between 2.29 and 3.77 miles too far west of that line, making the waste sites, along with the current towns of Farwell, Texline, and part of Glenrio, appear to be within the State of Texas. New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was surveyed on the correct meridian. New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the waste sites for all purposes are taxed and governed by Texas. The city was set to be the location of the now defunct $400 million HT3R project. In 1972, Andrews became the site of the first Kirby Company vacuum cleaner factory outside of the original location in Ohio. It is often referred to as \\"Kirby West\\" to signify the westward expansion of the company, which employs about 200 people.

As of the 2010 census, this South Texas coastal fishing community had a population of 1,358. The town is named for George Ware Fulton, a land developer in the area. Geography Fulton is located at , on the western shore of Aransas Bay. It is bordered to the south by the city of Rockport, the county seat. Texas State Highway 35 passes through the center of the town, leading north across the inlet of Copano Bay. Corpus Christi is to the southwest, and Port Lavaca is to the northeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 42.77%, is water. History Site of former meatpacking plant Sign on the Fulton waterfront Fishing boats in Fulton harbor Fulton was founded in 1866, and named by George Ware Fulton, Sr., whose wife Harriet Smith Fulton inherited 11,000 acres on the northern end of the Live Oak Peninsula, including the area where Mr. Fulton created the town he named for himself. Fulton had been a teacher in Indiana and decided to come to Texas by flatboat with 60 other men during the war for independence between Texas and Mexico. After the long trip to Texas, George Fulton found that the war was over but he joined the Army of the Republic of Texas for a few months. He worked for Henry Smith, the first Governor of Texas, and married Smith's daughter, Harriet. They raised a family and moved around the country as George found jobs supervising rail roads and building bridges. When Harriet inherited 48,000 acres of Texas coast, they moved back to live on the Live Oak Peninsula. After ten years, the Fultons built a large house, now known as the Fulton Mansion, just south of the town. The Fultons owned thousands of cattle wandering on their extensive lands, and formed a cattle company with others. Mr. Fulton built slaughter houses, and patented a chilled slaughter house, the first in the world. The town quickly became the site for many slaughterhouses as cattle from south Texas were driven to Fulton. The cattle slaughterhouses lasted until the 1880s, when railroads reached the area and provided ways to ship live cattle to population centers such as Chicago. In 1930, some evidence of a prehistoric settlement was found in the Fulton area, possibly Karankawan. On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Fulton at category 4 intensity.

The population was 8,766 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat. Rockport is adjacent to the town of Fulton, and many refer to the combined communities as \\"Rockport- Fulton\\"; however, Rockport and Fulton are legally separate municipalities. History=Rockport's Founding Following the Civil War, a number of people considered developing the Live Oak Peninsula. Joseph F. Smith, who had founded the nearby town of St. Mary's in 1850, joined with Thomas H. Mathis and his cousin J.M. Mathis, who were agents of the Morgan Steamship line, and built a wharf at the site of what would later become the town of Rockport, in 1867. The same year, George W. Fulton and his wife, Texas heiress and Joseph Smith's cousin, Harriet Smith Fulton moved to her extensive land holdings on the peninsula. Fulton also took an interest in the development of Rockport, as well as creating the town of Fulton farther up the coastline. In response, a nascent cattle-slaughtering and packing operation at the wharf expanded rapidly, allowing Rockport to be officially incorporated as a town in 1870; its name arising from the rock ledge that runs along the shore. Thomas Mathis became Rockport's first mayor after being appointed by the governor. A year later in 1871, the town achieved \\"city\\" status after continued growth. Early Years' Boom & Bust In 1871, the Mathis cousins teamed up with local ranching families of George W. Fulton and Thomas M. Coleman to raise and slaughter cattle for shipment out of the city's wharf on their steamship line. The partnership proved highly successful, and continued to draw people and businesses to the city. The national Panic of 1873 took its share of the town's prosperity and caused a slump for the next few years. The meat packing market was slow to recover, and the Mathis cousins abandoned the ranching partnership in 1879. Fulton and Coleman then re-formed their ranching partnership, an organization that continued into the 1930s. For many years Fulton and others petitioned for the railroad to extend their lines to Rockport to provide a second source of transportation and break the Morgan Line's monopoly on the Coastal Bend ports. After offering free rights of way across the Coleman-Fulton ranch, and hundreds of acres in town lots, finally, in 1888 the railroad arrived. The Morgan Steamship company now had competition, and as the local cattle ranchers began shipping live cattle by train, The Morgan Line withdrew from serving the Coastal Bend. Another brief growth spurt began and soon ended, here and across Texas, due to some bad winters and the development of the cattle industry in the mid-west. The railroad, however, brought tourists, and the city's economy grew with several large hotels catering to that industry. Rockport's economy soon came to be dominated by shipbuilding and tourism toward the end of the 19th century. At the same time, the railroad offered speedy transportation for crops, and a land boom caused by farming followed until brought to a halt with the national Panic of 1893. 20th Century Rockport's economy continued struggling into the early 20th century and took another hit in 1919 when a major hurricane decimated the region. A slow recovery ensued stalling additional development. The city's fortunes however began to improve in 1925 following the establishment of a lucrative shrimping industry which grew further during the 1930s and benefited from the construction of a harbor in 1935. Shrimping activity decreased during World War II but recovered thereafter, boosting the town along with an important boat-building industry that developed in this period as well. By the century's end, shrimping continued to be an important part of the Rockport economy alongside fishing and tourism. 21st CenturyHurricane Harvey= On August 25, 2017 Hurricane Harvey (name now retired) made landfall near the city as a Category 4 storm on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale.

The school board has voted to consolidate with Olney ISD, the neighboring school district in Olney, Texas (about 12 miles southeast), subject to voter approval on May 13, 2006. Proponents argued that the school (which had only 63 students, including only one in seventh grade) simply cannot continue to function, and consolidation with the neighboring district (which had nearly 800 students) would provide more opportunities for educational achievement.

Pleasanton honors its cowboy heritage with the \\"Mr. Cowboy\\" sculpture in front of City Hall and across from the giant oak tree downtown. The roots of the cattle kingdom can be traced to Atascosa County in the 1860s, which calls itself \\"the birthplace of the cowboys.\\" The sculpture is a gift from Ben and Mona Parker. The Longhorn Museum in east Pleasanton on Highway 97 contains artifacts and memorabilia of the cowboy years. The Cowboy Homecoming, begun in 1966, is an annual event held at the Atascosa River Park in Pleasanton. History Pleasanton was established in 1858 when conflicts with the Native Americans caused the settlers to move the location of the county seat from Amphion. The settlers chose the current townsite because of its location at the mouth of Bonita Creek. John Bowen (died 1867), San Antonio's first Anglo-American postmaster, founded and named the town of Pleasanton after his good friend and fellow early Texas Settler John Pleasants. At one time Pleasanton had two newspapers, the Pleasanton Picayune, which became the Pleasanton Express in 1909, and the Pleasanton Reporter. The county seat was relocated from Pleasanton to Jourdanton in 1910. Pleasanton was incorporated in 1917. Along with San Antonio, Uvalde, Crystal City, Carrizo Springs, and Corpus Christi, Pleasanton was a major stop on the now-defunct San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad, which operated from 1909 until it was merged into the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1956. The rail headquarters was located in a modern two-story depot in North Pleasanton beginning in 1913. However, headquarters closed in 1926, and later the SAU&G;, or the Sausage Line as it was called, was merged into the Missouri Pacific. The headquarters depot has been razed, but an earlier depot in Pleasanton is displayed at the Longhorn Museum. The remaining San Antonio-to-Corpus Christi freight line is under the Union Pacific system. In November 1957, the citizens of Pleasanton voted overwhelmingly to desegregate the public schools. This came some two months after the crisis at Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. Some three dozen African American pupils were then integrated into the Pleasanton school.Civil Rights Chronicles, p. 158 Geography and climate Pleasanton is located at (28.966953, -98.484937), about south of downtown San Antonio, south-southwest of Austin and north by north-northwest of Corpus Christi.

Austin, with the help of Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, to be the main site in Texas for American colonization. Founded in 1824 as San Felipe de Austin, the town served as the capital of Stephen F. Austin's first colony and the founding site of the Texas Rangers. James (Jack) Cummins was appointed as the first alcalde or mayor. By 1828, San Felipe had been surveyed, with Calle Commercio laid out as the main commercial street. Austin and his secretary, Samuel May Williams, both resided in log cabins on the square. There were about 30 buildings, and at least one of these was a wood-framed structure. Also on the square was the tavern of Jonathan Peyton. By 1835, the town's population had increased to around 600. It was home to the first post office and one of the earliest newspapers and land offices in Texas. San Felipe was second only to San Antonio as a commercial center of Texas. The Texas conventions of 1832 and 1833 and the Consultation of November 3, 1835, were held here. San Felipe acted as the capital for the provisional government of Texas until the Convention of 1836.

The town of Muleshoe was founded in 1913 when the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway built an line from Farwell, Texas, to Lubbock through northern Bailey County. In 1926, Muleshoe was incorporated. The population was 5,158 at the 2010 census. The county seat of Bailey County, it is home to the National Mule Memorial. The Muleshoe Heritage Center located off the combined U.S. Routes 70 and 84 is a popular museum which commemorates the importance of ranching to West Texas. The complex has several unique buildings originally from Bailey County that display the living conditions of the area in the late-19th century and the early to mid-20th century. The Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge is located some to the south on State Highway 214. Founded in 1935, the refuge is the oldest of its kind in the state of Texas. It is a wintering area for migratory waterfowl flying from Canada to Mexico. It contains the largest number of sandhill cranes in North America.Texas Historical Commission marker, Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge, 1985 History Muleshoe, circa 1914-1915 The name Muleshoe can be traced in the region to Henry Black when he registered a brand on November 12, 1860. In 1877, Black purchased three houses on in Stephens County, naming it Muleshoe Ranch. Later, he built a large ranch house and a log schoolhouse, and established a small cemetery for family members. Muleshoe Ranch was supposedly named after the owner found a mule shoe in the soil. On April 23, 1906, the Gulf, Santa Fe and Northwestern Railway Company and the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway Company merged and were chartered to construct a railway between Lubbock and Farwell on the New Mexico border. From 1901 to 1915, communities along the future railway contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to construction.Hunt, William R. \\"Muleshoe, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed November 8, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Muleshoe was founded in 1913 when the Pecos and Northern Texas Railway laid rails across northern Bailey County; residents borrowed the name from the nearby Muleshoe Ranch. Soon after the railroad passed through Muleshoe, the town expanded rapidly. In 1917, Muleshoe became the county seat after the county was organized, but it was not incorporated until 1926. Muleshoe continued to grow quickly, and by 1930, 800 residents were in the town. Three decades later, Muleshoe tripled in population to 3,871. In 1970, Muleshoe reached its pinnacle at over 5,000 residents, 200 businesses, two hospitals, two banks, a library, a newspaper, and a radio station. Main Street in downtown Muleshoe During the 1970s and 1980s, the population stagnated, and by the 1990s, Muleshoe's population began to decrease. The population went from 5,048 in 1988 to 4,530 in 2000. The once lively and vibrant Main Street is now quiet with many abandoned buildings. Many of the businesses that once called Main Street home are now on American Boulevard (US Highway 84/70). During the early 1960s, Texas residents were eager to build a memorial to the mule for its strength and sparse eating habits, traits which endeared it to the pioneers. In war, the mule carried cannon; in peace, it hauled freight. Its small hooves allowed it to scale rocky areas.Texas Historical Commission marker, National Mule Memorial The Mule Memorial was first displayed on July 4, 1965 near the intersection of US 70/84. Muleshoe is the home of the world's largest mule shoe found at the Muleshoe Heritage Center. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Muleshoe lies on the western extreme of the Central Time Zone, just east of the Mountain Time Zone. Muleshoe is situated on the Great Plains in an area where the plains reach their highest altitude at the foot of the Rocky Mountains known as the High Plains; more specifically, it is located on the South Plains in a region known as the Llano Estacado. The area topology is gently rolling plains with a large number of playa lakes on top of a large plateau. Many of the playa lakes have dried out due to the water exploitation of the Ogallala Aquifer that helped supply water to the lakes during dry seasons. Soil types vary from dark brown playa-lake silt to iron-rich clay to sandy soil; topsoil and subsoil layers vary, as well. Most of the area contains a layer of caliche; in some areas, no topsoil or subsoil reveals the layer of caliche, while other places have up to 4 ft of topsoil or subsoil combined. Muleshoe lies over the largest aquifer in the United States, the Ogallala Aquifer. The aquifer provides all of the city's water and is essential for the agriculture for the surrounding area. The aquifer is being depleted at an increasing rate over the years; this has triggered many changes in agriculture in efforts to preserve this natural resource. The physical characteristics of the region makes Muleshoe an ideal place for agriculture. Much of the natural habitat of grasslands and shrubs has been replaced by cash crops and livestock, but a few areas of native fauna (called Conservation Reserve Program) are preserved. About south of Muleshoe, is a system of sink lakes is found at the Muleshoe National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is a wintering area for large numbers of migratory waterfowl and sandhill cranes, and preserves much of the native wildlife.

Rainfall is low; the town and vicinity receive less than of rainfall annually. High summer temperatures (average July temperature above 90 ¬∞F) precipitation moisture is rapidly lost to evaporation. Muleshoe experiences steady, and sometimes intense, winds from the north and west in the fall and winter and winds from the south or west in the spring and summer. The winds add a considerable wind chill factor in the winter. Shortgrass prairie, prickly pear cacti, and scrub vegetation are the most common flora to be seen around town. Agriculture in the forms of cattle ranching, dairy farming, and wheat and cotton farming are the most prevalent in the area.

Map of city in 1887 History Spanish soldiers lived temporarily at the current site of Bastrop as early as 1804, when a fort was established where the Old San Antonio Road crossed the Colorado River and named Puesta del Colorado. Bastrop's namesake, Felipe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, was a commoner named Philip Hendrik Nering Bogel, who was wanted for embezzlement in his native country of the Netherlands. In Texas, he assisted Moses and Stephen F. Austin in obtaining land grants in Texas and served as Austin's land commissioner. In 1827, Austin located about 100 families in an area adjacent to his earlier Mexican contracts. Austin arranged for Mexican officials to name a new town there after the baron who died the same year. Historic buildings with restaurants and shops line Main Street in Bastrop. On June 8, 1832, the town was platted along conventional Mexican lines, with a square in the center and blocks set aside for public buildings. The town was named Bastrop, but two years later, the Coahuila y Tejas legislature renamed it Mina in honor of Francisco Javier Mina, a Mexican revolutionary hero and martyr. The town was incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Texas on December 18, 1837, and the name was changed back to Bastrop. Overlooking the center of the town is the Lost Pines Forest. Composed of loblolly pines (Pinus taeda), the forest is the center of the westernmost stand of the southern pine forest. As the only timber available in the area, the forest contributed to the local economy. Bastrop began supplying Austin with lumber in 1839 and then San Antonio, the western Texas frontier, and parts of Mexico. A fire in 1862 destroyed most of downtown Bastrop's commercial buildings and the county courthouse. As a result, most current downtown structures postdate the Civil War. In 1979, the National Register of Historic Places admitted 131 Bastrop buildings and sites to its listings. This earned Bastrop the title of the \\"Most Historic Small Town in Texas\\". 2011 fire On September 4, 2011, two wildfires started when trees fell on power lines. The first fire started in the community of Circle D-KC Estates near Bastrop State Park, and the other fire started about north. The two fires merged into the Bastrop County Complex fire. On September 6, two lives were lost, as well as 600 homes with no containment. On September 7, firefighters on the ground were able to get 30% containment. On September 11, fire crews had the fire 50% contained and had already lost more than 1,500 homes. On September 17, light rainfall in the area helped fire crews fight the flames. The fire was 85% contained. The fire burned until October 10, when fire officials declared the fire 100% contained. This was the worst and most destructive wildfire in Texas history, as it destroyed 1,691 homes, killed two people, and caused $325 million of insured property damage. The drought in Texas at the time combined with strong winds from the Gulf of Mexico caused by Tropical Storm Lee helped fuel the fire.

The population was 3,817 at the 2010 census. Smithville is part of the metropolitan area. History Dr. Thomas Jefferson Gazley arrived in 1827 and set the pace of development for Smithville by building the first house and establishing the first store, which served incoming settlers and the friendly Lipan and Tonkawa Indians. He later served in the Mexican government and helped write the Texas Declaration of Independence and the first Constitution, and became a true Texas hero. William Smith's family arrived several years after Dr. Gazley. They also owned a store and were early influences on the area, including the naming of Smithville where about seventeen families lived on the south bank of the Colorado River. Local businessman, Murray Burleson, persuaded the approaching railroad to erect a Terminus here and the TB&H; steamed through in 1887. The Missouri, Kansas & Texas took over the Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railroad in 1891. In 1894, the MK&T; established central shops in Smithville, giving rise to growth which resulted in Smithville becoming the largest town in Bastrop County for nearly fifty years. This population created markets for homes, stores, and other necessities as it grew from a frontier village to a town. The Hill family moved retail marketing here and established the first bank. The need for infrastructure systems attracted the Buescher brothers to come and create the first utilities. Partnerships of prominent, able men involved in land-based activities united the Bueschers, Powells, Cooks, Eaglestons, Turneys, Rabbs, Buntes and others to establish cotton gins, general stores, drugstores, lumber and brick yards and to develop numerous churches and fraternal organizations such as the Masons and the Oddfellows and to provide medical care for this now flourishing community. In 1895, this thriving town was officially incorporated into the City of Smithville. Almost immediately, the city fathers recognized the importance of education by creating the Smithville School District; and Smithville has been fortunate during its development to have forward-thinking men and women who were stalwart and industrious and who paved the way to the fine city and enviable way of life its citizens enjoy today.

Education Seymour is served by the Seymour Independent School District. History Seymour in 1890 Seymour was founded by settlers from Oregon, who called the town Oregon City; it was originally located where the Western Trail crossed the Brazos River, which flows just south of the townsite. A post office was established in 1879, when the town's name was changed to honor local cowboy Seymour Munday, after whom nearby Munday was also named. The census of 1880 shows 78 people living in the 901 square mile county. The first settlers were ranchers. During those years, the Millett Brothers established a large ranch with the headquarters some 10 miles south of Seymour on Miller Creek. There were about 50 men in the Millett outfit and some of these were reported to be outlaws. It was not unusual for some of the cowboys to ride into town and proceed to \\"shoot it up\\". The Milletts realized that law had come to Baylor County in 1884 and sold the ranch. It was the largest transaction ever made in northwest Texas at that time. The purchasers used the Hashknife Ranch brand, which is still in use in the county. Commerce, a newspaper, a hotel, and the county courthouse all followed soon after, as did violence between cowboys and settlers. The town experienced two distinct economic booms: the first, short- lived, was with the construction of the Wichita Valley rail line in 1880, and the second was due to the discovery of oil in 1906. The population grew from 500 in 1884 to almost 3800 in 1950; it remained at about that level for more than 30 years, but has declined since to 2,740 in the 2010 census. Agribusiness, as well as some tourism from nearby Lake Kemp, has overtaken oil as the driving factor of the local economy. The Old Settlers Reunion and Rodeo has been held each July since 1896. The town calls itself \\"the crossroads of North Texas\\" because it is located at the junction of five highways: U.S. highways 82, 277, 183, and 283, and State Highway 114. On August 12, 1936, the temperature at Seymour reached , the highest temperature ever recorded in the state of Texas.

It is the county seat of Bee County and home to the main campus of Coastal Bend College. The area around the city contains three prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Many of the stately homes, commercial buildings, and schools in the area, including the Bee County Courthouse, were designed by architect William Charles Stephenson, who came to Beeville in 1908 from Buffalo, New York. Beeville is a National Main Street City. Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore, and son Lincoln, took up residence in the city during the time Rushmore was being sculpted. History and culture The original site on the Poesta River was first settled by the Burke, Carroll and Heffernan families in the 1830s. Present-day Beeville was established on a 150-acre land donation made by Ann Burke in May 1859 after the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States. It was first named \\"Maryville\\" for pioneer Mary Heffernan. It was renamed \\"Beeville\\" after Barnard E. Bee, Sr., who had served as Secretary of State and Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas. It was called \\"Beeville- on-the-Poesta\\", with a nearby community \\"Beeville-on-the-Medio\\" seven miles (11 km) to the west. The first post office opened in 1859. In 1886, the first railroad was constructed through Beeville, stimulating the growth of the economy and population. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company operated these railroads until the early 1970s. Beeville was incorporated as a town in 1890, but the incorporation was dissolved the following year. Beeville was reincorporated as a town again in 1908. The city streets were paved in 1921. The Rialto Theater, one of the Beeville structures designed by W. C. Stephenson, cost $25,000. The Rialto opened on August 19, 1922, with the silent film The Three Musketeers starring Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. Admission was twenty-five cents for adults and ten cents for children. The theater is now used for special occasions and live performances. The Texas oil boom brought in many new residents, which grew the population of the city to 4,806 in 1930. By 1950, the population more than doubled to 9,348. The United States Navy operated the Beeville Naval Air Station, which trained Navy airplane pilots during World War II from 1943 through 1946. The base was reopened in 1952 as Naval Air Station Chase Field, continuing in operation until 1992. Beeville was served by Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) during the 1950s. TTa operated scheduled passenger flights with Douglas DC-3 prop airliners from Chase Field with service to Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Harlingen, Houston, San Antonio and other destinations in Texas. In 1967, the town was inundated by of rain during Hurricane Beulah. Today, the city of around 14,000 residents is enjoying something of a boom from the Eagle Ford Shale oil extraction project.

The city is on the Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and Waco and is the seat of Bell County. The population was 22,885 in 2019 according to a US Census Estimate. the metro region had a population of 450,051. Although the county seat and a sizable city itself, Belton is by far the smallest of the three principal cities in Bell County, even appearing as more of a suburb of Temple. History Belton c. 1881 Belton and Bell County have been the site of human habitation since at least 6000 BC. Evidence of early inhabitants, including campsites, kitchen middens and burial mounds from the late prehistoric era have been discovered in the Stillhouse Hollow Lake and Belton Lake areas. The earliest inhabitants were the Tonkawa, who traditionally followed buffalo by foot. Belton was also home to the Lipan Apache, Wacos, Nadaco, Kiowas and Comanche. By the 1840s most tribes had been pushed out by settlements, but skirmishes with the Commanches existed until the early 1870s. Belton was first settled 1850 and named Nolanville, taking the name of nearby Nolan Springs which were named for Texan explorer Philip Nolan. In 1851, it changed its name to Belton after being named the county seat of newly created Bell County named after Texas' governor, Peter Hansborough Bell. In 1860, the population was 300, the largest in the county. During the run up to the civil war, Belton had a large pro-Union minority. A Whig Party paper and anti-secession paper called \\"The Independent\\" was published there and the city voted overwhelmingly for Sam Houston for governor, who was strongly against Texas secession.The Belton Independent Nonetheless, in 1861 Bell County voted for secession and many residents fought in the Confederate Army. After the civil war, Belton experienced unrest. Several pro-union sympathizers were lynched in 1866 and Federal troops were called in to protect the Federal Judge serving in the city. After reconstruction, the city, close to a major feeder of the Chisholm Trail, served as growing business center for the region. In 1868, Martha McWhirter, a prominent figure in Belton's non-sectarian Union Sunday School, created the Woman's Commonwealth, the only Texas women's commune of the 1800s. The commune started several business ventures including a successful hotel. In 1899, the group sold their holdings and relocated to Maryland. Texas State Historical Association - Belton Woman's Commonwealth The town experienced rapid growth in the 1880s with the building of the courthouse, Baylor Female College buildings, and a \\"railroad war\\" in which, by 1881, Belton was bypassed by the railroad which built Temple as the local junction and depot town. In 1904, the town reported a population of 3,700. The town began to thrive and reached a population of 6,500 in 1928. However the town was decimated by the Great Depression and was down to a population of 3,779 only three years later in 1931. The town began to recover in the run up to World War II as Fort Hood was opened nearby in 1942. Encompassing over 200,000 acres and almost 90,000 troops, this brought a large population and a lot of economic activity to the area. By 1950, the city's population was back up to 6,246 and by 1990 had reached 12,476. Geography Beach at Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Center.

Water Control and Improvement District No. 4 was established on land near the Killeen city limits and the military post in 1955, and included the land owned by Pinckney R. Cox and Harley Kern, two hog farmers. These two men subdivided their land in 1957 and began selling lots.

Following a petition for an incorporation election, the city was established on September 24, 1960, and Cox was elected mayor. Kern had died before the incorporation, and the Harker in Harker Heights was a concatenation of Harley Kern's name as a tribute to one of the original landowners.

The population was 4,259 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Killeen-Temple-Fort Hood Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Nolanville reached its peak as a town between 1890 and 1900, when it went into a holding pattern. A weekly newspaper, the Item, was started by 1896. The first telephone service in Nolanville was started, using barbed wire for lines. Two lines were used, a south and a north, with Nolan Creek serving as the dividing line. Nolanville School, one of the larger rural schools in the county in the early 20th century, had 90 pupils in 1903. The first automobile appeared between 1900 and 1910. The automobile caused Nolanville businesses to decline because it made the trip to Belton or Killeen so much easier. In 1921, a new two-story brick school was built, and in 1938, the original part of the present school plant was built. By the mid-1940s, the community had 150 to 200 residents, but began to decline after the end of World War II. After dropping to 50 inhabitants in the 1950s, the town began to revive in the 1960s and had 200 residents and six businesses when it incorporated on March 27, 1961.

Nolanville Common School District #50 ceased to exist in the spring of 1972, when it was annexed to the Killeen Independent School District by the Bell County Board of School Trustees. This action was requested by the Nolanville Board of School Trustees. The Nolanville Common School District was one of only three remaining common school districts in Bell County at that time. It was also uncommon for a school to consolidate because its enrollment and academic needs were greater than its capacity rather than because enrollment had dropped. By 1974, Nolanville's population was 1,050. It had grown to 1,834 in 1990 and 2,150 in 2000, then jumped to 4,259 as of the 2010 census. The city became home rule in the 2011 election.

The first record of white settlers in the area occurred in 1834, but by 1836, the pioneer settlers abandoned the area due to frequent Indian attacks and the invasion by General Santa Anna and the Mexican Army.History of Salado The first permanent Anglo-American settler at Salado was Archibald Willingham in 1850. In 1852, the Salado Post Office was established. In 1859, the Salado College Joint Stock Company was created by Col. Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson, who donated 320 acres north and south of the springs to be broken into lots and form the village of Salado, with the proceeds of the sale going to form Salado College. The college operated from 1860-1885 and 1895-1913; the former college building was occupied by the Thomas Arnold High School. From 1866 to 1885, the famous Chisholm Trail cattle drives passed through this area, with the Stagecoach Inn being one of the stops. In 1867, Salado incorporated to build a bridge across Salado Creek. By 1884, Salado had a population of 900, seven churches, 14 stores, two hotels, two blacksmiths, and three cotton gins.

Located off Interstate 35, Temple is north of Austin, south of Waco and 27 miles east of Killeen. The primary economic drivers are the extensive medical community (mostly due to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center ‚Äì Temple) and goods distribution based on its central location between the Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston metropolitan areas, and proximity to larger neighbors Austin and Waco. History Temple was founded as a railroad town in 1881 by the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad. It was incorporated in 1882.Britanica. 1984 Edition. Vol. IX, p. 879 The town was named after a Santa Fe Railroad official, Bernard Moore Temple. Temple was a civil engineer and former surveyor with the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company. In 1882, the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad built through the town, and soon after, the Santa Fe railroad made Temple a division point. In its early years, Temple was a town of shacks and tents with a large number of saloons and tough characters found in the early West. Locally, it was nicknamed \\"Tanglefoot\\", because some residents found that the combination of muddy streets and liquor made walking through the town challenging. After the town was incorporated in 1882, two private schools were founded in the city; the Temple Academy was organized and public school was established in 1884. In 1893, the annual Temple Stag Party began, growing out of a private Thanksgiving celebration attended by the town's leading men. It was held until 1923. The Temple Railroad and Heritage Museum, on the second floor of the Santa Fe Railroad station at 315 West Avenue B, commemorates the significance of railroads for the city.

Temple would be a stop along the line, regardless of where that connection between the two lines would be. The next year in 2010, TxDOT received a federal grant to conduct a study for a line connecting Oklahoma City with San Antonio, and Temple was in the pathway of that line. In 2013, a consultant for the Texas High Speed Rail Corporation stated that the only two connections being considered for the two lines were a connection in Temple and a connection in San Antonio; they expected to make that decision by the end of 2014. The organization also indicated that they plan to have the high-speed rail in operation by 2025. If that connection occurred in Temple, the Killeen ‚Äì Temple ‚Äì Fort Hood metropolitan area, with a population of 420,375, would be within about 45 minutes of Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio.

It is part of the San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan statistical area. Its population was 7,341 at the 2010 census. History According to anthropologists, the area was occupied seasonally from about 5,000 BC by small bands of nomadic Native American tribes in search of food and game. The Lipan Apache moved into the area in the late 17th century and occupied it throughout the 18th century. However, the Lipan were forced from the area in the early 1820s by the Comanche Indians. A small farming and ranching community began to develop in the area shortly after the Texas Revolution in the late 1830s. The ranches suffered occasional attacks by the Comanches until the late 1870s. In 1858, a Scottish immigrant, Dr. George Marnoch, purchased the land that later became the site of the town. Marnoch's home at one time served as a stagecoach stop and a post office for cowboys driving their cattle from Bandera to auction in San Antonio. His heirs sold a portion of their property in 1880 to a Swiss immigrant, Arnold Gugger, who built a home and mercantile store around which the town of Helotes arose. In 1908, Gugger sold his property to Bert Hileman, who opened the town's first dance hall. He was also instrumental in getting old Bandera Road paved and opening the town's first filling station. He sold his property in downtown Helotes in 1919, when the town's population declined. In 1946, the manager of San Antonio's Majestic Theatre, John T. Floore, opened the landmark John T. Floore Country Store, which is actually a dance hall (or \\"honky tonk\\") that draws top country music talent, including Willie Nelson, who still plays the venue on occasion. Floore also financed the first annual Helotes Cornyval festival in the 1960s, which was held to celebrate the opening of a new post office. Corn played an important role in the heritage of Helotes. The local Native Americans planted corn (maize outside the US) in the fertile valleys of the area, and feed corn was a major crop grown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The town name is derived from the Spanish word elote, which can mean \\"ear of maize\\", \\"corncob\\", or simply \\"corn\\", but exactly how the town came to be called Helotes is still a subject of debate. As the urban sprawl of San Antonio expanded and approached the outskirts of Helotes in the 1970s. After a decade of planning and negotiation, Helotes became an incorporated city in October 1981. To this day, residents struggle with the dilemma of maintaining the city's rugged country charm, while at the same time allowing for the development of modern suburban facilities and businesses. Helotes was the hometown of the late Texas State Senator Frank L. Madla, who died after his home on the south side of San Antonio caught fire on November 24, 2006. 1953 tornado On April 28, 1953, the town was hit by a violent wide F4 tornado struck the city, damaging or destroying multiple structures. Two people were killed and 15 others were injured. Overview Helotes' historic Zion Lutheran Church When Helotes incorporated in 1981, very little was in the town. Now with a population over 7,000, Helotes is becoming one of the most desirable suburbs of San Antonio. Helotes itself includes the newly renovated Old Town Helotes. Completed in 2011, Old Town Helotes is the revitalized downtown, which includes John T. Floore's Country Store, All That Glitters, L&M; Feed and Supply, Mander Automotive Service, First Baptist Church of Helotes, Elf Hardware, Helotes Tactical Firearms, Helotes Creek Winery, and El Chaparral Mexican Restaurant. Helotes is home to Oak Valley golf course, the first golf course in South Texas to be fully lit at night. The Morales family built the golf course on their vast acres of land acquired by Lorenzo Morales, a pillar of the community. He was extremely influential in settling Helotes. The Cornyval Festival is an annual city tradition bringing in local vendors and thousands of area residents to celebrate the namesake of the town. Geography Helotes is located in northwestern Bexar County in the valley of Helotes Creek where it exits from the Texas Hill Country. The city is about northwest of downtown San Antonio. Texas State Highway 16 runs through the community, leading northwest to Bandera. The Charles W. Anderson Loop, the outer beltway around San Antonio, is southeast of the center of Helotes.

History  The Town of Hollywood Park was officially incorporated on December 7, 1955, after residents were concerned about losing the neighborhood's autonomy to San Antonio. The community has a distinctly rural feel and residents often build homes they intend to live in for the rest of their lives. Many of the community's leaders of today are the children and grandchildren of some of the original residents. The Police Department was established in 1955 soon after the town was incorporated. John Nelson was hired as its first Police Chief. The police car was a Ford Fairlane 500. Shortly thereafter, a few volunteer part-time policemen joined the force. When the town was formed, water hoses had to stay connected at each residence and ready to use in case of a fire. In 1958, a group of men joined together and a couple of volunteers attended the Firefighters School at Texas A&M; University, and the Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department was founded. That year all the firemen had was a small pump unit. Robert Oakes, as general chairman, and many volunteers organized the first Hollywood Park Volunteer Fire Department Benefit Barbeque held June 22, 1968, at Raymond Russell Park. Volunteers prepared all the food. 746 people went through the serving line. The event was held for many years at Raymond Russell Park with games for the entire family and a live band. Funds were raised for equipment and to purchase 20 new two-way portable alerting units. Fred T. Keepers, Jr. was Fire Chief from 1967 ‚Äî 1978. By 1969, eighteen dedicated volunteers provided protection for the 612 residents of Hollywood Park, Hill Country Village, as well as over a large area of ranchlands in the northernmost sections of Bexar County. The City provided the firemen with bright yellow uniforms, but they got no other compensation for their duty. The largest fire occurred in August 1968 when a grass fire erupted near Hwy 281 and burned off 3,000 acres. By 1973, there were 29 volunteers. A new Rescue Unit was purchased through fund raising projects and donations. In 1971, Mr. Voigt - a rancher who owned the land the town was built on - donated $10,000 to the Town of Hollywood Park to build the Voigt Center, naming Alverne Halloran as custodian, until the town matched funds to begin building. The 3,000 sq. ft. recreation building was finally built in 1974, and the grand opening and dedication was held on October 20, 1974. This was a day of fun and entertainment with games, food and drink offered. The City Council designated this day as \\"E.E.Voigt Day\\" in honor of the occasion. Mayor Felix Forshage opened the ceremony. Mr. Voigt introduced his family and spoke of the origin of the park. Tennis courts and a covered picnic area were built in 1975 with an additional $5,000 donation from Mr. Voigt for the tennis courts. A children's playground was added later. In addition to the homes originally built in Hollywood Park, two additional sections were added later to include The Gardens of Hollywood Park and The Enclave of Hollywood Park.  Past mayors  B.K.

History Kirby was founded as an agricultural community by German immigrants in the early 1900s. Its name derived from the Kirby yard of the Southern Pacific Railroad that crossed through the town. In 1920 the population was around 18 people, made up of mostly farmers. At this time German was a commonly spoken language. In the 1950s, the composition of the city shifted from mostly agricultural to military as individuals settled in homes to commute to work at Randolph AFB. The population grew to 600 at this point, and German was less commonly spoken. In 1955 the city was incorporated. A two-year-long drought began in 1957, which ultimately caused many farm failures. Unable to make a profit, the farmers decided to sell their land to the city. Homes and roads were constructed on the purchased land, and the city was further transformed into the suburban area it is today.Lopez, Raquel.Small Town Research Project , Palo Alto College, 2006-05-31.

The current mayor is Lisa Pierce. The charter also identifies a city manager to be directed by the council, and accountable for the operation of the city.City of Kirby , April 10, 2008 Education Residents of Kirby are zoned to Judson Independent School District. They are zoned to : * Hopkins Elementary School * Kirby Middle School * Karen Wagner High School Description Kirby is located in eastern Bexar County. The northern and southern sections of the city differ both in culture and appearance. The city has a large community sector and much support for the city comes from the public. Kirby takes full advantage of its natural resources found both in the neighborhoods and the agricultural sector alike. Northern Kirby The northern section of the city contains the Kirby Manor and Old Town neighborhoods. It includes Kirby Middle School, Old Seguin Road, FM 78, Gibbs Sprawl Road as well as the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. Because of the railroad tracks, Kirby has been dubbed \\"The hobo capital of Texas.\\" A consistent population of homeless people live under the 410 overpass. Southern Kirby The southern section of the city contains Hopkins Elementary School named after longtime principal Joseph Hopkins. This area of the city is divided between a strictly agricultural sector between Hopkins Elementary and Candlewood Elementary and the homes of the astronaut streets on the other side of Binz Engleman Road. Ackerman is the main road here; it leads to Interstate 10. Community sector Kirby is characterized as strictly a suburban area of San Antonio. Kirby has its own fire and police departments. The City Hall is located on Bauman Street. This is also where Kirby Municipal Court is located. The Police Department and New Fire Station are located on Ackerman Rd. The city has two parks on both sides of Binz Engleman separated by Ackerman. The western half of the park consists of mostly baseball fields, and the eastern section is accommodated with a full range of recreational activities. Natural resources Pecans are common throughout Kirby Kirby is a major producer of pecans, which grow naturally in the soil. Pecans produce in large quantities between September and November. Certain trees do not produce every four years. 1996, 2000, and 2004 were all years with low pecan production. Rosillo Creek is the main water stream in Kirby. It once provided the farmers in the agricultural sector with water to irrigate their crops. The creek flows from under the railroad tracks on Gibbs Sprawl Road and further downstream divides Hopkins and Candlewood Elementaries before emptying into Salado Creek in southeastern Bexar County. Neighborhoods The neighborhoods of Kirby include Kirby Manor, Old Town, Kirby Terrace, and the Springfield Manor (Astronaut Streets). Kirby Manor Kirby Manor is located within Old Seguin Road to its north, Ackerman Road to its east and Binz Engleman Road to its south. The houses of Kirby Manor were built between the 1950s and 1960s. The citizens are a mix of the native settlers in this area and the newer crowd of young people moving in from other San Antonio suburbs and urban areas to start a life. Kirby Manor's proximity to the police station on Ackerman is the main reason why this area has a lower crime rate than the other areas of Kirby. Old Town Old Town is located between Old Seguin Road and FM 78. Its eastern and western boundaries include Gibbs Sprawl Road and Kirby Middle School, respectively. This is the area where the first homes of Kirby were built. The area is also where Kirby City Hall is located, the former Kirby Post Office and the old Kirby Fire Department were located. The inhabitants of this area are increasingly becoming younger as the older citizens die off, but there is still a large elderly population. Springfield Manor Springfield Manor (Astronaut Streets) is the westernmost section of Kirby. The area is given this name due to the streets, which are named after famous astronauts. This is the newest section of Kirby and has a large population. To its north is FM 78, to its south is Ackerman Road, to its west is Springfield Road and to its east is Binz Engleman Road. Kirby Terrace Kirby Terrace is across from Hopkins (formally Kirby) Elementary, bordered on one side by Ackerman Road.

It is located less than 20 miles south of Downtown San Antonio and is part of the metropolitan area. The population was 1,631 at the 2010 census. History English speaking European settlers had already arrived in the area by the early 1800s. Somerset was named for an organized settlement that had been begun in 1848, in what is now Atascosa County, by a group of Baptist families from Somerset, Kentucky. The present site was named Somerset when the First Townsite Company was formed on the Artesian Belt Railroad right-of-way on May 25, 1909, by A. M. Pyron, Carl Kurz, and Jonas A. Kerr. In 1913, while drilling for artesian water, Kurz discovered oil. A boom followed. The Somerset oilfield extended from Somerset to below Pleasanton and was the largest known shallow field in the world at that time. Two oil refineries in the field and a pipeline into San Antonio handled the high-gravity crude. The town grew rapidly from fifty residents in 1925 to 700 in 1928; it was served by a state bank, a ten-room hotel, and several machine and blacksmith shops. A post office opened there in 1920. A nearby lignite coal mine also added to the booming economy of the area. During the 1920s farmers turned from cotton to dryland fruit and vegetable farming. In 1931, the Somerset Fruit Growers Exchange building was dedicated, and between truck farming, oil, and coal, the town prospered until the mid-1930s, when diminishing oil returns and the Great Depression caused a decline. In 1931 the town reported twenty businesses; by 1958 there were only eight. In 1920, the Somerset Independent School District was formed from at least five other school districts: Wildman, Senior, Bexar, Old Rock (Old Somerset area), and Oak Island. The Somerset Police Department was created in 1972 followed by the city being incorporated in 1973. Somerset has a mayor-council form of city government.

History Clifton was founded in the winter of 1852‚Äì1853, when the families of Frank Kell, Joseph A. Kemp, Samuel and Monroe Locker, and T. A. McSpadden settled in the vicinity. The town was named Cliff Town after the surrounding limestone cliffs. Over the years the name was altered to Clifton. The site was originally on the banks of Clear Branch. The Masonic lodge hall and a log schoolhouse were the first public buildings. The post office was established in 1859. The First Presbyterian Church of Clifton was organized in 1861 and is the county's oldest church in continuous service. The Baptists built the first church building in Clifton in 1884‚Äì85. After the Civil War, Joel Martin Stinnett (1806-1875), the grandfather of Joseph Kemp, built a flour mill powered by the Bosque River. In 1868, this mill was replaced by a limestone mill, which was converted to the electric power plant that provided the first electricity for Clifton homes and businesses. A three-story school known as Rock School was built about 1870 and served the community for more than twenty years. In 1893, a new building was constructed on property donated to the Clifton school system. In 1880 the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway built a station a mile south of Clifton. Merchants moved their businesses closer to the railroad station, and the town thrived as a business and trade center. The Merchant Exchange and Flour Mill, the first steam flour mill in the Bosque valley, was established in 1887 or 1888. The Clifton Record, a newspaper that began publishing in 1895 under the ownership of W. C. O'Brian, continued to serve the community. Clifton served as the county seat between 1890 and 1892. Clifton Lutheran College, later known as Clifton College, opened in 1896. The community was incorporated in 1901. An earlier attempt at incorporation in 1891 failed when the election results were declared invalid. A fire on December 23, 1906, destroyed a large portion of the business district, which was eventually rebuilt. The Clifton Volunteer Fire Department was organized in 1907. The town's need for a hospital was met by Dr. V. D. Goodall and Dr. S. L. Witcher, who formed the Goodall-Witcher Hospital in 1938, which is still operating today along with the Clifton Clinic. The Lutheran Sunset Home for the elderly was established in Clifton in 1954. In 1991, the Bosque River flooded much of the town due to torrential rains. The town had an estimated population of 204 in 1904 and 3,542 in 2000. It now has a population of 3,442. On December 21, 1929, a weather station near Clifton recorded 24 inches of snowfall. This is the greatest daily snowfall recorded for anywhere in Texas. On January 15, 2017 an EF1 Tornado struck Clifton damaging at least 25 homes. Although no injuries were reported, the heaviest damage was in town near the intersection of Pecan and Avenue G. Culture In May 1997, the Texas Legislature officially designated Clifton as the Norwegian Capital of Texas. Clifton and the surrounding area was settled by Norwegian immigrants in the mid-19th century. The nearby community of Norse is the final resting place of Cleng Peerson, commonly recognized as the \\"Father of Norwegian Immigration to America.\\" The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway.Early Norwegians in Texas (Royal Norwegian Consulate General in Houston) Visitors to Clifton may explore the vast collection of pioneer Norwegian articles at the Bosque Memorial Museum, or take the Cleng Peerson Memorial Highway west to the Norse Historic District. Sites along the route include many 19th century homes and churches. Among them is Our Savior's Lutheran Church, which was established in 1869. The church is the annual site of the Norse Smorgasbord, a feast of traditional foods introduced to the area by Norwegian settlers. Further down the road a Lutefisk dinner is held annually in Cranfills Gap, near the site of the historic St. Olaf Kirke, often called the Old Rock Church. Norse, Texas (Handbook of Texas) Clifton celebrates its Norwegian heritage each year with the Norwegian Country Christmas Tour, held the first Saturday of December. The daylong event features demonstrations of Norwegian crafts, tours of homes and buildings harkening back to the days of the early settlers, and many other related activities. The 1999 tour was a featured Road Trip appearing in the November 1999 issue of Texas Highways.Clifton, the Norwegian Capital of Texas (Texas (Lone Star State Dictionary) The City of Clifton was officially designated a Cultural District by the Texas Commission on the Arts and the State of Texas on Saturday, October 22, 2011. Clifton is home to the Bosque Arts Center. Housed in a restored three-story building that was the former Main Hall of Clifton College, the organization offers a local outlet for visual and performing arts unique for a city of Clifton's size.

Cranfills Mountain is in the western part of the city, rising above the city center. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History The area in which Cranfills Gap is located was originally settled by and named for George Eaton Cranfill in 1851. Norwegian settlers in and around the community, who were mostly Lutheran, built St. Olaf Kirke (kirke is Norwegian for \\"church\\") in a rural area just outside Cranfills Gap. St. Olaf Kirke, commonly referred to as The Rock Church, is a small Lutheran church located in the unincorporated rural community of Norse, Texas. Among the pioneers in Norse was Cleng Peerson. The founder of Norse was Ole Canuteson (Ole Knudsen) from the Stavanger region of Norway. In 1917, as the congregation of that church began to grow, a new church was built for the congregation inside the city.Early Norwegians in Texas (Norwegian Consulate General Houston) http://www.norway.org/misc/print.aspx?article={c95a6190-1eba-491a-86f5-1be6da87fa9d} The city slowly grew to its peak population of 600 in 1940. During World War II, Cranfills Gap was the first city to sell more than its quota of war bonds for the Fourth War Loan Drive. While as many as 25 businesses operated within \\"the gap\\", as locals commonly refer to it, the population and the business activity slowly dwindled to roughly nine businesses in 1980 and a population of 269 in 1990. On December 3, 2008, KXXV-TV in nearby Waco reported on its website that Cranfills Gap had been selected for participation in an advertising campaign for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The selection process compared hundreds of rural communities from across the USA seeking \\"the most unique all-American town in all of the 50 states.\\"\\"Entire Town Going to Vegas!\\" by Eric Gemmell, KXXV-TV Waco, online news article, retrieved 2008-12-04 Cranfills Gap was first contacted by the LVCVA in October 2008 when the town was placed on the list of ten candidate communities. A film crew and LVCVA representative visited the town for a few days and interviewed residents about the town, their impressions of and experience with Las Vegas, and their opinions about the ongoing selection process. In November 2008, Cranfills Gap Chamber of Commerce members were notified that the LVCVA had shortened the list to two finalists including their town. Another LVCVA delegation was dispatched to Cranfills Gap for a closer look. The visitors stayed for about a week and conducted a fresh set of interviews and observed the community at work and play. Although the LVCVA had initially intended to send 150 residents from the winning locality to Sin City, the Cranfills Gap Chamber of Commerce and elected officials struck a feasible compromise with their visitors: if selected, Cranfills Gap would make every effort to provide one hundred adult men and women for the LVCVA's project. During the first week of December 2008, Cranfills Gap and local media were notified by LVCVA that the town had won the nationwide search and 100 of its residents would be sent on a free trip to Las Vegas during the weekend of December 5‚Äì7, 2008. Cranfills Gap City Council member Ron Hubbard told the press that he sincerely hoped Cranfills Gap would reap benefits from the ad campaign beyond just plane tickets and memories. \\"With that national recognition, maybe people will come visit, see what we're all about,\\" said Hubbard.

The territory around Maud, known before the Republic of Texas era as the Red River Country, was among the earliest settled areas, but Spanish claims to the land, outlaws from the Neutral Ground, and general lawlessness discouraged extensive development. After the railroad reached the site in 1870, a community gradually began to emerge. The town was named for Maud Knapp, daughter of Samuel D. Knapp, the first postmaster and the donor of land for the townsite. A post office opened in 1881, closed the next year, then reopened in 1893. By 1910, the population of the town had reached 300, and by 1940 it had grown to 750. During World War II the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were built north of the community. These two facilities provided jobs for many Maud citizens.

It was named after an early store keeper, W.J. Boston. It is part of the Texarkana metropolitan area. The population was 4,550 at the 2010 census. History The Red River Expedition (1806) was stopped by the Spanish in the vicinity of the town. When the Missouri Pacific Railroad was being constructed north of the village of Boston (now Old Boston) in the summer of 1876, it was clear to many businessmen in the town that it would suffer a serious decline as a consequence of its distance from the line. At a mass meeting, J. H. Smelser, a local resident and surveyor for the railroad, was selected to meet with railroad officials to secure the location of a depot at a point on the line nearest to Boston. The negotiations were successful, and in September 1876, lots were laid out and put up for sale on that the railroad had purchased. Because most of those engaged in the project were from Boston, the new town was named New Boston. A post office was established in 1877 with L. C. DeMorse as postmaster. The town grew rapidly, and by 1884, it had 400 residents, two churches, a school, several mills and gins, and a newspaper, the New Boston Herald, edited by W. W. West. A furniture factory and another newspaper, the Bowie County Populist, were added in the 1890s. By 1900, the town had a population of 762. It grew slowly until the late 1920s, when a short-lived boom raised the population from 869 in 1925 to 1,300 in 1929. The population fell to 949 by 1931. During World War II, the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant and the Red River Army Depot were constructed just southeast of New Boston. The two massive military installations were probably responsible for the town's rapid growth in the 1940s. The population grew from 1,111 in 1940, then to 2,688 in 1950. In 1980, it reached 4,628. Although an International Paper mill, the Barry Telford state prison and a few smaller factories provided some industrial base for the town, New Boston depends heavily on the two military installations for its continued prosperity. The town had 5,057 residents in 1990 and 4,550 residents in 2010. New Boston is known for its Pioneer Days Festival and Rodeo.

It grew up in the mid-1870s around a sawmill operated by two men named Daniels and Spence, who named the community Ingersoll, in honor of the agnostic Robert Ingersoll. A post office was established in 1881, and by 1884 the town had an estimated population of fifty. In 1886 a big revival meeting was held in the town, which resulted in about 110 conversions. Shortly after the meeting residents of the town, no longer wishing to honor the agnostic, decided that the name of the town should be changed. They had just completed a new well that yielded red water, and the town was renamed for this feature. The name of the post office was not officially changed until 1894. Although the population of the town swelled to an estimated 300 by 1892, by 1900 it had fallen to 128. It reached 250 in the 1920s.

Per having met a daughter of one of Wake Village's original designers, she informed me that the layout design of Wake Village, which features the main circle with streets originating and radiating from it, was deliberate in its design.

Education Bailey's Prairie is zoned to schools in the Angleton Independent School District. History According to The Handbook of Texas, Bailey had been living in Texas for several years before Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred original families arrived. Born in North Carolina in 1779, Bailey was married at a young age, and the couple had six children. After his first wife died, he married her sister, Hannah, and fathered five more children. Bailey moved to Kentucky and apparently served in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Supposedly, he was prosecuted for forgery before he left the state. He next lived in Tennessee and fought in the War of 1812, after which he headed to Texas to settle land that would later become part of Brazoria County, specifically Bailey's Prairie. Bailey allegedly bought his land from the Spanish government. After Mexico won its independence from Spain however, the Mexican authorities refused to recognize his claim that the land belonged to him. Bailey would not give up his home even though Austin ordered him to leave. Though Bailey and Austin apparently disliked each another, Austin recognized Bailey's squatter's claim to the land. He was given a league and a labor of ground on the east bank of the Brazos River and was commissioned as a captain in the local militia. At that time, Texans were loyal Mexican citizens, and Bailey took the oath to defend the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Bailey gained a reputation as a troublemaker, one who regularly engaged in brawls and was evidently a constant thorn in Austin's side. He died of cholera on December 6, 1832.

According to legend, the ghost, carrying a lantern, roams across the flat land of Brazoria County at night in constant search for a jug of whiskey which was to have been buried with Bailey. The ghost appears as a bouncing white ball of light floating about four to six feet off the ground. Many claim to have seen this phenomenon known as \\"Bailey's Light,\\" but no one knows its cause. The light has been known to \\"chase\\" vehicles travelling on the highway late at night or in the early morning hours. In his will, Bailey demanded that he be buried standing upright and facing west. According to legend, he also wanted his rifle at his side and the jug of whiskey at his feet. The slaves who dug his grave were said to have stolen the whiskey. Other versions of the legend maintain that his wife, Hannah, threw the jug of liquor in the field so that it would not be buried with her husband, which would have been an affront to God. Media The actor Paul Fix plays Bailey in the 1969 episode \\"Here Stands Bailey\\" of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor not long before Taylor's own death.

Calvit's plantation later became the Herndon sugar plantation, owned by John H. Herndon, who married Calvit's only daughter.Diana J. Kleiner. The History of Texas Online After the American Civil War, Joseph Pegan, Soloman J. Clute, and several relatives including George and John Clute, founded a community near the plantation site. In 1881, the name Clute was adopted when both plantations were bought by Solomon J. Clute. George was described as, \\"a little Yankee from New York with a long, white beard.\\" The other founders of Clute have also been described as northerners. The Clutes acquired additional land from Herndon, who put it up for auction in the 1870s. A deed dated March 17, 1886, transferred ownership from Soloman Clute to George Clute for property known as Clute's Place. Soloman administered the community until 1888 or 1889, when it was sold. The Eagle Island Plantation of William H. Wharton occupied the site of present Restwood Memorial Park. In 1933 Clute had only two businesses and a population of ten.

File:Sweeny TX Hospital.jpgSweeny Community Hospital on FM 1459 History Sweeny's settlement, though not under this name, began before Texas was even a Republic. Imla Keep, a doctor and member of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred colonists, received title to a league and labor of land that included the site of Sweeny on July 24, 1824. Keep eventually returned to Louisiana, and Martin Varner acquired the land. The land was named for John Sweeny, a Tennessee colonist who arrived with family members and 250 slaves in the area in 1833. He came after his sons, William Burrell and Thomas Jefferson Sweeny, had purchased land grants near the townsite. They purchased the land grants for the price of a load of mules, and came to examine their new land holdings in 1831. John Sweeny settled nearby, and in 1835, purchased the original Imla Keep League from Varner and constructed a house on the site. The home, today the Sweeny Plantation, a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, was occupied by original family members through the 1990s. The original home was built in 1837 by slaves using only bricks, nails, and cypress and ash wood from the land. There were also 30 slave cabins made of cypress wood. The plantation had its own sawmill, sugar house, cotton gin, blacksmith shop, commissary, and a kiln for brick manufacture. The town was named for John Sweeny. The original town stood in a forest of hardwoods with soil twenty feet deep. Sweeny was briefly called Adamston when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the area in 1905 and laid a side track lined with gardens to the community. A post office was established in 1895, closed in 1897, and was reestablished in 1909 as Sweeny. Sweeny's cotton gin and general store were built by 1908, a school was organized in 1911 with eleven students, and church services were held in 1912, when a Civic Club was founded to promote civic and social improvements. Around 1910 the R. D. McDonald Bernard River Land Development Company, which later gave a plot of land to each church denomination, purchased acreage in the area, cut it into lots, and sold it. Burton D. Hurd platted the townsite in 1911. His Burton D. Hurd Industrial Land Company promoted ten-acre suburban garden farms in the area with the slogan, \\"Soil Richer Than the Valley of the River Nile\\" to prospective settlers. By 1914 the community had a hotel, a flour mill, three general stores, a cotton gin, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a population of 200. In the 1920s Sweeny shipped cotton, vegetables, live-oak parts for ships, and, for a time, bullfrogs raised by area farmers. In 1918 it had a brick factory and an orange orchard. Sweeny had an independent school system by 1912; school enrollment reached 236 by 1927, and by 1937 the community had three black schools and an all-grade white school with six teachers. The Ku Klux Klan operated briefly and held one cross-burning in the community. In 1934, oil was discovered in Old Ocean, creating development which made Sweeny prosper. In 1942, a government carbon black plant was built which was taken over by Phillips Petroleum, which developed the facilities into a refinery, natural gas liquids center, and petrochemicals complex with pipelines to markets in the eastern United States. In 2000, Phillips Petroleum merged with Conoco Inc. to form ConocoPhillips. Sweeny's population in the latter 20th century has fluctuated from 3,087 to 3,699.http://www.khou.com/story/news/local/2014/07/24/12396014/ File:Sweeny TX Levi Jordan Plantation.jpgLevi Jordan Plantation State Historic Site on FM 521 File:Sweeny TX VFW Post 8551 Howitzer.jpg155 mm Howitzer at VFW Post 8551 on FM 1459 Timeline of Sweeny Welcome sign in front of City Hall Education Schools are part of the Sweeny Independent School District which serves the city of Sweeny as well as outlying areas including Churchill, Shady Acres, River's End and Old Ocean.

History Columbia was established in 1826 by Josiah Hughes Bell when the town was laid out two miles west of Marion, later known as East Columbia. Columbia was briefly the capital of the Republic of Texas from September to December 1836. The town hosted the First Congress of the Republic of Texas when Sam Houston became president on October 22, 1836. The House of Representatives and Senate each met in private homes. The First Congress voted to move the capital to Houston on November 30 because Columbia lacked living quarters for government officials. On December 27, 1836, Stephen F. Austin died at the home of George B. McKinstry in Columbia. The town, which became known as West Columbia, saw its commerce decline after the government moved away. A post office was set up in 1905. When oil was discovered in the West Columbia oil field in 1918, the town became a center for cotton, oil, rice and sulphur. By 1928, the town's population rose to 2,500, but the ill-effects of the Great Depression caused the number of residents to fall to about 1,000. In 1940 there were 1,573 persons living in West Columbia and 50 businesses. During the 1950s, the population increased to 2,100. By the 1960s big oil companies had a considerable presence near town and the area boasted the most cattle in the state. In 1960 West Columbia had 2,947 residents, in 1970 it had 3,335 and in 1990 it had 4,372. In the next two decades the population dipped slightly.

It is located in the heart of the Brazos Valley (East and Central Texas). As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 76,201. As of July 2019, the estimated population was 86,276. Bryan borders the city of College Station, which lies to its south. Together they are referred to as the Bryan‚ÄìCollege Station metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 250,069. History Bryan welcome sign The area around Bryan was part of a land grant to Moses Austin by Spain. Austin's son, Stephen F. Austin, helped bring settlers to the area. Among the settlers was William Joel Bryan, the nephew of Stephen Austin. In 1866 the county seat of Brazos County was changed from Boonville to Bryan, and a post office was opened. In 1867, after many delays caused by the Civil War, the Houston and Texas Central Railroad, which had only previously gotten as far as Millican, finally reached Bryan. A short time later, in 1871, the city of Bryan became incorporated. Just south of Bryan, Texas A&M; College opened in 1876 in what later would be known as College Station. The following year, 1877 saw the establishment of the Bryan Independent School District. Keeping up with progress in the rest of the country, Bryan added electric lighting and a waterworks to its community in 1889. The fifth Brazos County courthouse was built in 1892, and by the turn of the century, in 1900, the International-Great Northern Railroad stopped in Bryan. Using a generous grant of $10,000 from Andrew Carnegie, the Carnegie Library of Bryan opened its doors in 1902. A bell, made in 1905 and rung in 1918 to signal the end of World War I is still located out front today. In 1910 the town built an interurban railroad to College Station. By 1923 the line was abandoned. The first Jewish place of worship, the Temple Freda synagogue, was opened in 1913.\\"Bryan, Texas\\" , found in the Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities, During the 1930s the town of North Oakwood merged with Bryan. Now Bryan and College Station are \\"twin\\" cities. In 1936 State Highway 6 was built, running right through town. In 2006 the Texas A&M; University System announced that the new Texas A&M; Health Science Center campus would be built in Bryan near the new Traditions Golf Course development. A fire at the El Dorado Chemical Co. in 2009 caused the evacuation of 70,000 residents due to the burning of ammonium nitrate, possibly causing minor respiratory problems. However, the city requested that only \\"anyone who can smell smoke or see smoke to evacuate their homes and businesses\\" and did not enforce an evacuation except for 500 homes in the nearby vicinity of the fire. Less than 1,000 residents chose to evacuate, taking shelter at Texas A&M; University, which closed its campus for the day to ease traffic problems. City fire officials chose to let the fire burn down before tackling it, since the chemicals were water reactive.KBTX 6pm broadcast The evacuation, which started at 2:30 pm CST ended at 7 pm, except for a small, defined area immediately around the fire, where approximately 100 Bryan residents lived. In the end, only 500 residents were under a mandatory evacuation, and 35 people were treated for respiratory problems from the smoke. Officials from El Dorado said there was never any danger from the smoke or fire. The warehouse, valued at just under $1 million, was destroyed. In 2010 the Brazos County District Attorney's Office started the enforcement of a \\"Gang Safety Zone\\" in response to an escalation in violence within Bryan. Major US papers and ABC News covered this move. Cities like Houston and Los Angeles looked to the Bryan model of safety enforcement surrounding gang violence. The injunction declared a area in Bryan as the Gang Safety Zone. This placed about half of downtown in the area. In 2013 the Planned Parenthood clinic in Bryan closed as a result of state budget cuts which impacted family- planning facilities. The facility began offering abortions in 1998; it was one of three in the state which ceased operations on August 31, 2013. Geography Bryan is located northwest of the center of Brazos County.

It is northwest of Houston and east northeast of Austin. As of the 2010 census, College Station had a population of 93,857, which had increased to an estimated population of 117,911 as of July 2019. College Station and Bryan together make up the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area, the 13th-largest metropolitan area in Texas with 273,101 people as of 2019. College Station is home to the main campus of Texas A&M; University, the flagship institution of the Texas A&M; University System. The city owes both its name and existence to the university's location along a railroad. Texas A&M;'s triple designation as a Land-, Sea-, and Space-Grant institution reflects the broad scope of the research endeavors it brings to the city, with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. Due largely to the presence of Texas A&M; University, College Station was named by Money magazine in 2006 as the most educated city in Texas, and the 11th-most educated city in the United States.  History The origins of College Station date from 1860, when the Houston and Texas Central Railway began to build through the region. Eleven years later, the site was chosen as the location for the proposed Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, a land-grant school. In 1876, as the nation celebrated its centennial, the school (renamed Texas A&M; University in 1963) opened its doors as the first public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. The population of College Station grew slowly, reaching 350 in 1884 and 391 at the turn of the century. However, during this time, transportation improvements took place in the town. In 1900, the I&GN; Railroad was extended to College Station (the line was abandoned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company in 1965), and 10 years later, electric interurban service was established between Texas A&M; and the neighboring town of Bryan. The interurban was replaced by a city bus system in the 1920s. In 1930, the community to the north of College Station, known as North Oakwood, was incorporated as part of Bryan. College Station did not incorporate until 1938 with John H. Binney as the first mayor. Within a year, the city established a zoning commission, and by 1940, the population had reached 2,184. The city grew under the leadership of Ernest Langford, called by some the \\"Father of College Station\\", who began a 26-year stretch as mayor in 1942. Early in his first term, the city adopted a council-manager system of city government. Population growth accelerated following World War II as the nonstudent population reached 7,898 in 1950, 11,396 in 1960, 17,676 in 1970, 30,449 in 1980, 52,456 in 1990, and 67,890 in 2000. The population for the Bryan-College Station metropolitan area crossed 270,000 people in 2018. In the 1990s, College Station and Texas A&M; University drew national attention when the George Bush Presidential Library opened in 1997 and, more tragically, when 12 people were killed and 27 injured when the Aggie Bonfire collapsed while being constructed in 1999.

Districts=Northgate Northgate is a mixed-use district north of Texas A&M; University that features a combination of businesses, restaurants, apartments, churches, and entertainment. It is a vibrant part of the city known for its eclectic mix of restaurants and bars. A large portion of the stores, bars, and restaurants in Northgate are frequented and patronized by Texas A&M; students, and the establishments employ A&M; students, as well. In total, the district spans about , bounded by Wellborn Road to the west, South College Avenue to the east, the College Station city limits to the north, and University Drive to the south. The district is the home of the Dixie Chicken and of the first Texas location for the regional fast-food chain Freebirds World Burrito. Northgate's roots started in the 1930s as the city began enjoying rapid population growth from the influx of Texas A&M; University students, professors, and their families. Realizing that proximity to the campus would be a boon for revenues, the first business district was established in College Station near the campus, taking its name for the closest on-campus landmark: the north gate. When the city was incorporated in 1938, its first City Hall was opened in the new district. In 1994, restoration efforts began to revitalize the ailing area. A four-day music festival, \\"North By Northgate\\", was introduced in 1998 and has become an annual tradition, renamed the \\"Northgate Music Festival\\" in 2002. In 2006, the city council incorporated Northgate as a special tax zone to finance additional improvements and expansions. Live music is a major draw to the Northgate area, with venues such as Church Street BBQ and Hurricane Harry's consistently providing evening concerts. Many well-known musicians, especially in the Texas country music scene, have gotten their starts playing on the porches and stages found in the Northgate area. Notable names include Robert Earl Keen, Grammy award-winner Lyle Lovett, Dub Miller, and Roger Creager. The district is bisected to the north by Church Street, made famous by the Robert Earl Keen and Lyle Lovett duet \\"The Front Porch Song\\". Wolf Pen Creek District View of the Lofts at Wolf Pen Creek in College Station Wolf Pen Creek District is a large commercial development adjacent to Post Oak Mall and between two of the city's main commercial thoroughfares: Earl Rudder Freeway and Texas Avenue. The area consists of a greenway with trails, a $1.5 million amphitheater and entertainment area, a small lake, the Spirit Ice Arena, and is the home of the Arts Council of the Brazos Valley. The amphitheater has hosted a variety of musical events, including the annual Starlight Music Series, a concert series that starts in late spring and runs through late summer. Wolf Pen also has a sidewalk for a scenic run that when completed is about . Wellborn District Wellborn became a community in 1867 as a construction camp on the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. The town's name has been attributed to a well at the construction camp, a foreman named E.W. Wellborn, or a landowner named W.W. Willburn. Also in 1867, a post office opened in the community under the name Wellborn Station. In 1870, the name was shortened to Wellborn.\\"Wellborn, Texas\\". The Handbook of Texas online. Retrieved July 3, 2009. On April 14, 2011, the City Council of College Station voted 5-2 to annex Wellborn, thus making the community the Wellborn district. Wellborn is often mispronounced as 'well-born' but is pronounced by locals as 'Well-burn'.

The population was 5,905 at the 2010 census. The town has an elevation of 4,475 ft (1,364 m), and the surrounding mountain peaks are over a mile (1600 m) above sea level. The university, hospital, library, and retail make Alpine the center of the sprawling but wide open Big Bend area (combined population only 12,500) including Brewster, Presidio, and Jeff Davis Counties. History Brewster County Courthouse, built in 1888 by local contractor Tom Lovell The area had been a campsite for cattlemen tending their herds between 1878 and the spring of 1882, when a town of tents was created by railroad workers and their families. Because the section of the railroad was called Osborne, that was the name of the small community for a brief time. The railroad needed access to water from springs owned by brothers named Daniel and Thomas Murphy, so it entered into an agreement with the Murphys to change the name of the section and settlement to Murphyville in exchange for a contract to use the spring. In November 1883, the Murphys registered a plat for the town of Murphyville with the county clerk of Presidio County. The town's name was changed to Alpine on February 3, 1888, following a petition by its residents. At this time, a description of the town mentioned a dozen houses, three saloons, a hotel and rooming house, a livery stable, a butcher shop, and a drugstore, which also housed the post office. Alpine grew very slowly until Sul Ross State Normal College (now Sul Ross State University) was opened in 1920. The development of Big Bend National Park in the 1930s and '40s spurred further growth. The population was estimated at only 396 in 1904, but by 1927, it had risen to 3,000. The 1950 census reported Alpine's population at 5,256, and a high of roughly 6,200 was reached by 1976. In 1990, the population was down to 5,637. In 2000, the population grew modestly to 5,786 and 5,905 by 2010. The town was always small enough that no one insisted on tearing down old buildings to make parking lots, and it is still too small to interest most big-box store chains. The Holland Hotel, built during a brief mercury mining boom, was designed by Henry Trost, a distinguished regional architect. Today, it helps to anchor a traditional downtown of early 20th- century buildings still occupied by family-owned retailers and restaurants. Geography The town sits on a high plateau, in the Chihuahua Desert, with the Davis Mountains to the north and the Chisos Mountains to the south. Outcrops of ancient volcanic rocks spread to the northwest. Other layers of rocks have been exposed over time as the mountains were forced up and then eroded. The high elevation cools the desert air in the evenings. Alpine is located on U.S. Route 90 about east of Marfa and 31 miles west of Marathon. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Climate In the winters, ample sunshine usually warms the days, though the nights can be chilly due to the elevation. In the summer, the fierce sun causes hot days, pleasantly relieved in the evening by the same high elevation. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Alpine has a semiarid climate, BSk on climate maps. *Coordinates: *Elevation: Demographics As of the 2000 census, 5,786 people, 2,429 households, and 1,435 families resided in the city.

Education=Colleges and universities Sul Ross State University began as a teachers college in 1920, with its original campus in Alpine. Named for Lawrence Sullivan Ross, a Confederate States Army general during the American Civil War, Texas' 19th governor and later president of the new land grant college which became Texas A&M;, it is now a member of the Texas State University System. The 600-acre main campus on the lower slopes of Hancock Hill contains 20 or so buildings, most designed in Classical Revival style, and all harmoniously faced with red brick and white trim. The hillside gives fine views of the town below and the surrounding mountain ranges. The Bar-SR- Bar brand of the college is whitewashed on stones high above. In 1981, students placed a desk on Hancock Hill and today visitors are invited to hike up to \\"sign the register\\". About 2,000 students attend here, many living in Lobo Village, which boasts 250 new apartment-style residence units. Both bachelor's and master's programs are available in fields such as behavioral and social sciences, business administration, computer science and mathematics, education, geology, law enforcement, and vocational nursing. Sul Ross ranked number four in affordability among public universities according to U.S. News & World Report. It was included in \\"The Nation's 30 Most Attractive Yet Affordable Campuses\\", published by AffordableSchools.net, based on its combined qualities of affordability and the beauty of the campus and surrounding area. Intercollegiate sports include men's and women's basketball, cross country, track and field, and tennis, along with men's baseball and women's softball, men's football and women's soccer, and women's volleyball. The teams are known as the Lobos, and play in the American Southwest Conference. Sul Ross was the founding home of the National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association in 1949. The Sul Ross Rodeo Club competes in 10 NIRA rodeos each year. The NIRA rodeo hosted in Alpine is a big event for the school and the community.

Funding came from the Texas Centennial Commission and the Works Progress Administration, a federal make-work program during the Depression. Open Tuesday-Sunday, admission is free. Library The Alpine Public Library opened a facility in February, 2012, offering computer use with free Wi-Fi and access to online data, as well as traditional books, magazines, and other periodicals, CDs and DVDs, and a used bookstore, Re- Reads. Located at 805 W. Avenue E, it has a community meeting room, and is open Mon-Sat. Begun by volunteers in 1947, the Alpine Public Library remains an independent entity with its own board of directors, though it is well- supported by the taxpayers of Brewster County and the City of Alpine. The community institution has a staff, with additional work done by volunteers. Special programs, like a science club and computer learning, are aimed at users from preschoolers and teens to parents and retirees. Hospital Big Bend Regional Medical Center is a 25-bed facility.

A member of the Pecos League, the Cowboys play their home games at Kokernot Field. Alpine is also home to the high school football team the Alpine Fightin Bucks. The Bucks are a class 3A Division I high school football team. Sites on National Register of Historic Places The Brewster County Courthouse and Jail was built in 1887‚Äì1888 by Tom Lovett, a local contractor, who apparently designed the buildings, as well (documentation is scarce). Open to visitors, historic photographs are displayed in the great hall. The red brick courthouse is a fine example of the American Second Empire Style. The rectangular mass has five bays of paired round-arch window openings on the longer north and south facades. The shorter east and west facades have three bays. On three facades, the center bay contains a doorway at ground level, set in a thin, barely protruding pavilion. The second-story windows are slightly taller than the first-floor openings, a trick of the eye making the two-and-a-half-story building seem even taller. The walls are topped by a pressed-tin entablature composed of a frieze and cornice. The mansard roof is marked by steeply hipped pyramidal towers with pressed-tin cresting. The interior retains exemplary pressed-tin ceilings and some original woodwork. A wooden staircase with Eastlake-type details rises to the general courtroom on the second floor. The adjoining Brewster County Jail is distinguished by a crenelated brick parapet wall, suggesting \\"a fortress- like impregnability\\". Attractions Alpine makes a central base for exploring area attractions: the Big Bend National Park, Big Bend Ranch State Park, Fort Davis National Historic Site, Davis Mountains State Park with its Indian Lodge, the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center and Botanical Gardens, and the McDonald Observatory, perched atop Mt Locke at 6,790 feet.

Parade of Lights, December Public art A mural in the former post office at 109 West E St was painted as part of the New Deal make-work programs during the Great Depression. Surviving murals from the project are found in 60 or so Texas cities and towns. Completed in 1940, this mural is by a Spanish-born and trained artist, Jose Moya del Pino, who was living and working in San Francisco. In the foreground, three figures recline on a rocky overlook (somewhat improbably, but this is art, not photography). They are each reading: a book, a magazine, and a tabloid newspaper, celebrating how the post office brings information and education to small towns and even cattle ranches. On the horizon, the Twin Sisters peaks mark the location, with the town in the middle distance, including, at the behest of townspeople, the characteristic red-brick buildings of the Sul Ross State campus.last name=Parisifirst name=Philip, title=\\"The Texas Post Office Murals, Art for the People\\"publisher=Texas A&M; University Presswhere=College Station, Texas2004 Popular culture * J.

The episode first aired on November 15, 1957. In the story line, Gilman must change the false perception that has developed among the townspeople toward the Texas Rangers. The Trackdown narrator begins: \\"Alpine was like a hundred other towns in Texas. The only thing it had that most others didn't was ... the main line of the Southern Pacific. ... There is nothing unusual about this day in Alpine except that Hoby Gilman, a Texas Ranger, rode in.\\" At the end of the episode, when Gilman succeeds in reversing the attitude of the community, the narrator concludes: Alpine is a prosperous town again, but now there's a fine air of security about it. It's a nice town to live in, because they discovered as Hoby said they would, that when it got off its knees, it cast a much bigger shadow than it thought it did.

Falfurrias and Brooks County were featured in a 2014 Latino USA story on illegal immigration in South Texas.Migrant Deaths in Brooks County Texas - Latino USA - Latino USA Geography Falfurrias is located in northeastern Brooks County at (27.226529, -98.144922). The city is centered on the intersection of U.S. Highway 281 (Future Interstate 69C) and State Highway 285. Falfurrias is approximately southwest of Corpus Christi, east of Laredo, and south of Alice. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. History Falfurrias' founding and development were largely due to the efforts of Edward Cunningham Lasater, a pioneer Rio Grande Valley rancher and developer. In 1895, he started a cattle ranch in what was then northern Starr County. At one point, it was one of the largest ranches in Texas. With the extension of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway south from Alice to his ranch in 1904, Lasater founded the town of Falfurrias and subdivided a sizable portion of his ranch land for sale to other farmers. In 1898, a post office opened in the community. A local newspaper began publication in 1906. Lasater brought in his Jersey cows and established a creamery in 1909. Sweet cream butter and other products from Edward Lasater's creamery company made the town a familiar name across the state. But that butter is no longer made from milk produced in Falfurrias. Don Pedro Jaramillo, a Mexican-born curandero known as \\"The Healer of Los Olmos\\", was buried in Falfurrias in 1907 and is venerated at a shrine there. The state granted a petition by local residents to form a new county, Brooks, with Falfurrias as its county seat in 1911. Irrigation methods introduced to the area in the 1920s brought in truck farming and the citrus fruit industry. The city became a primary trade and shipping center for the surrounding region. The area received another economic boost in the 1930s and 1940s when extensive oil and gas reserves were discovered around Falfurrias. The city had a population of 6,712 in 1950, which declined throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. There were 5,297 people living in Falfurrias in 2000 and 4,981 in 2010. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened a Border checkpoint outside Falfurrias in 1940. It was most recently renovated in 2019 adding new cameras and X-ray machines. According to an NPR report he station has been increasingly busy due to a surge of migrants coming from Central America. Some have called to close the checkpoint because of the supposed link to immigrant deaths in the region. Name origin The name \\"Falfurrias\\" antedates Anglo association with the area, and its derivation is uncertain. Town founder Edward C. Lasater claimed that it was a Lipan word meaning \\"the land of heart's delight\\". Others believed that it was the Spanish name for a native desert flower known as the heart's delight. Another theory is that Falfurrias is a misspelling of one or another Spanish or French word. Still another theorizes that the name refers to a local shepherd named Don Filfarrias. The term filfarrias is Mexican slang for \\"dirty and untidy\\". Climate Falfurrias has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSh), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and characterized by very hot, humid, but generally dry summers and warm, dry winters with cold mornings.

Greenleaf Fisk donated to relocate the county seat to the west side of the bayou, on what is now the current site of Brownwood, and 100 additional acres for county use. The town was incorporated in 1884. During the Second World War, Brownwood was the location of U.S. Army Camp Bowie, which had a peak complement of over 80,000 soldiers.

In recent years, Martindale has also attracted a surprising number of film scouts who are smitten by the town's turn-of-the-century charm. As a result, various television shows, music videos and movies have been filmed in town: most notably A Perfect World, starring Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner, The Newton Boys, starring Matthew McConaughey and Ethan Hawke, and New Line's 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

Carl has been working closely with the residents of Martindale to plan the next phase of the town's rejuvenation. Model of the town Martindale after the proposed renovation by students at Texas State University. In Fall 2007, Carl worked with students at Texas State University of San Marcos in the Interior Design program, under the guidance of Assistant Professor and Program Coordinator Nancy Granato, to receive help envisioning further planning of the town. The project entailed assigning each group of students a specific building (i.e. silos, weigh station, etc.) to redesign the interior of and to think of a possible business that would work well with the space. One group worked on the landscape plan of the town in relation to planting native species of trees and plants, creating a city park, putting in new sidewalks and outdoor lighting. The ideas were then presented to Carl as well as some of the residents and leaders of the town. Students in the MBA program, under the guidance of Associate Professor Bob Hill, also presented Carl with a market analysis for the town of Martindale, TX. The presentation included an examination of the business district and potential economic opportunities; analysis of economic trends and activities to drive growth; and the identification new retail and restaurant opportunities.Chamblee, M (2007) History Martindale was established in 1855 by Nancy Martindale, who moved to Texas from Mississippi in 1851 and donated land for the townsite.

McDermett, early settlers here, petitioned the federal government to establish a post office in Cross Plains. In 1878, the government granted the post office, named \\"Cross Plains\\" for the crossings of stagecoach and military roads prior to the Civil War.

The town had one newspaper in 1902 (The Herald), but it soon went out of business. The second paper, The Cross Plains Review, started in 1909 and continues to publish a weekly newspaper every Wednesday. The town moved from the west banks of Turkey Creek to its present site in January 1911, to be closer to the railroad.

The population was 24,250 at the 2010 census. On April 3, 2007, San Benito celebrated the 100th anniversary of its naming. The post office was named \\"Diaz\\" from April to May 1907. The San Benito Museum, Freddy Fender Museum and Conjunto Music Museum opened in the same building Nov. 17, 2007. On October 25, 1975, on the television show Hee Haw, Freddy Fender saluted his hometown of San Benito, population 15,177. San Benito is part of the Brownsville‚ÄìHarlingen‚ÄìRaymondville and the Matamoros‚ÄìBrownsville metropolitan areas. History San Benito is known as the \\"Resaca City.\\" The Resaca de los Fresnos, wide, flows through the city. As indicated by its Spanish name, the resaca was a dry river bed. It is now the main canal of a large irrigation system. San Benito was at first named \\"Diaz\\" in honor of Porfirio D√≠az, president of Mexico at that time. The people in the San Benito area were predominantly of Mexican ancestry. The Anglo settlers came after the completion of the first irrigation system in 1906. Prior to that time, this region was an arid, mesquite-cactus-brush covered wilderness. Irrigation water touched off the crop production magic in the railroad. On July 4, 1904, the first passenger train arrived at Diaz. To celebrate the coming of the new railroad, the community leaders renamed the railroad station \\"Bessie\\", in honor of Bessie Yoakum, whose father, Benjamin Franklin Yoakum, was instrumental in the construction of the railroad. Some time later, when the town site was surveyed, the name was changed to \\"San Benito\\" in honor of Benjamin Hicks. He was a pioneer rancher whose charitable attitude endeared him to the population. The name was suggested by Rafael Moreno, the popular 90-year-old camp cook of the surveying party. Moreno suggested the name \\"San Benito\\" for his beloved \\"Saint Benjamin\\" Hicks.

Surrounding the base of the cross are life-sized statues of the 14 Stations of the Cross. Inspired by this cross, residents of Effingham, Illinois, erected a similar cross that is taller. Many claim this cross to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere. However, it is smaller than the cross erected in the Valle de los Ca√≠dos in Spain, located at and elevated overground. The cross is also shorter than the cross at the Mission Nombre de Dios in St. Augustine, Florida, and shorter than the Lakeuden Risti cross- shaped church tower in Sein√§joki, Finland.

History=Early exploration The route from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Santa Fe, New Mexico, along the Canadian River was charted circa 1849 by Captain Randolph Barnes Marcy. Published in 1859, Marcy's book, The Prairie Traveler: A Handbook for Overland Expeditions, contained maps and illustrations of routes between the Mississippi and the Pacific and was used as a basic manual by westward-bound wagon trains and travelers for years. The Log House on White Deer Creek, Eloise Lane Retrieved June 22, 2009 Colonel B. B. Groom Colonel B. B. Groom, an experienced cattleman near Lexington, Kentucky, leased from the New York and Texas Land Company of land in Hutchinson, Carson, Gray, and Roberts counties in the Texas Panhandle in 1882, resulting in the organization of the Francklyn Land and Cattle Company. Groom purchased an estimated 1,300 head of shorthorns in 1882 and selected the Diamond F brand, approved by the Francklyn officials and filed as the company's brand in October 1882. Unfortunately, Groom's vision of the finest and most desirable cattle ranch in the United States did not materialize for him. The Francklyn Land and Cattle Company became insolvent in 1886. The bondholders foreclosed and organized a new company known as White Deer Lands (later White Deer Land Company), under the management of the agent Timothy Dwight Hobart, one of the subsequent founders of Pampa, Texas. Harrison Groom Colonel Groom's son, Harrison Groom, established a camp at the edge of a little lake just west of the present town of White Deer.

History Temple Lea Houston historical marker at Square House Museum Panhandle derives its name from its central location in the Texas Panhandle. Originally named \\"Carson City\\", it was later changed to \\"Panhandle City\\". In 1887, Panhandle obtained a post office, and in 1888 the town was planned as the terminus of the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway. At that time the town was surrounded by several large cattle ranches. The community soon acquired a bank, a mercantile store, a wagonyard, a school, a newspaper, and three saloons. In 1888, Carson County was organized, and Panhandle became the county seat. J. C. Paul, an early settler of Carson County, described the Plains accordingly: \\"It was a beautiful smooth prairie as far as the eye could see, not a tree, not even a shrub knee high, to hide a jackrabbit, for miles in every direction. No fences, no roads, no houses, only a handful of people around Panhandle, the only settlement then in all that Plains country.\\" The cattlemen were reconciled to the arrival of farmers because they produced needed forage crops, such as hay, and introduced more families with eligible young women for the cowboy bachelors of the cattle kingdom.Lester Fields Sheffy, The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855-1935: Colonization of West Texas (Canyon, Texas: Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, 1950), pp. 120-121 Temple Lea Houston, the eighth and last child of politician Sam Houston, built a home near Panhandle.

Morrison was sentenced to die in the gallows at Vernon in Wilbarger County, Texas, his last words being: \\"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\\". In 1909, Panhandle voted to incorporate with a mayor- council government. The population grew in the 1920s when Panhandle became the center of a natural gas field. A new county courthouse was completed in 1950. Panhandle continued to thrive in the 1980s as a regional marketing and shipping center for cattle, wheat, and petroleum products.

George Tyng, general manager of the property, built the headquarters for White Deer or Diamond F Ranch at the site in 1887. Around the same time, the Purcell Company purchased land in the vicinity as a right- of-way for the Southern Kansas Railway of Texas. A depot was built in 1888. The site was initially known as \\"Paton\\" (after John Paton), then \\"Whig\\", before being renamed White Deer in January 1899 ‚Äì after nearby White Deer Creek. During the 1890s, British shareholders began selling land for small farms and ranches to settlers. The community moved to its present location near the railroad line in 1908. A year later, Henry Czerner and Ben Urbanczyk established a community of Polish farmers from central Texas at the northeastern edge of town. There were approximately 50 people living in White Deer by 1910. The discovery of oil and gas in Carson County in 1919 brought growth to White Deer and the surrounding area. The community incorporated in 1921, and the population had risen to 200 by the mid-1920s. At the peak of the oil boom in the late 1920s, White Deer was home to nearly 3,000 people.

It is east of Dimmitt, the county seat, and west of Tulia. According to the United States Census Bureau, Nazareth has a total area of , all of it land. History The town of Nazareth was established through the efforts of a Catholic priest, Joseph Reisdorff, who moved to the site in 1902 with four farmers interested in purchasing land in the area. Father Reisdorff named his colony after the biblical Nazareth and advertised for settlers in several midwestern German Catholic newspapers. By September 1902 the first settlers had begun to arrive. A post office was established in 1903, and later that year the Catholic community finished building its first church. Nazareth had 71 residents by January 1904, and the town was platted latter that year. By 1905, in addition to the church, the settlement included a blacksmith shop, a store, and a school; when the community's cemetery was consecrated in 1906, it became the only Catholic cemetery in the area. For many years local church officials supplied what little government the community required. In 1914 Nazareth had an estimated 50 residents, and about 150 people were living there by 1927. During the Dust Bowl of the 1930s the area was swept by huge dust storms that uprooted crops and made farming unprofitable; in 1933, the town was estimated to have only 50 residents. Agriculture in Castro County revived during the 1940s, however, and by 1941 about 200 people were living there. The population fluctuated during the 1950s and 1960, dropping to about 75 in 1955, then rising to an estimated 275 by 1964; the census found 274 people living in the town in 1970 and 299 in 1980.

The population of the city was 2,243 at the 2010 census. Anahuac is the seat of Chambers County and is situated in Southeast Texas. The Texas Legislature designated the city as the \\"Alligator Capital of Texas\\" in 1989. Anahuac hosts an annual alligator festival.Horswell, Cindy. \\"Anahuac drowning in budget and water woes.\\" Houston Chronicle. Monday July 23, 2012. Retrieved on July 25, 2012.  History  House of General Thomas Jefferson Chambers The Mexican term Anahuac comes from Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The name has various meanings, including \\"center\\", \\"world\\", and \\"city\\", but it also means \\"capital\\". An√°huac is the pre-Columbian name of the Valley of Mexico and its former lake basins around Mexico City, often including the Lerma and P√°nuco river systems. Despite the name, neither the city of Anahuac, Texas, nor the immediate region were ever part of the Aztec Empire. The first dwellers in this area were the Atakapan people as well as the Caddo. In 1721, Frenchman Jean Baptiste de La Harpe reached this area. In the 19th century the area became known as \\"Perry's Point\\", after Colonel Harry Perry, who erected a military post here in 1816. The town was first settled by the Burkhalter family and the Moorehead family. The Burkhalters were of noble background and migrated from Germany in 1801; they brought along their working family, the Mooreheads, who were the town swine farmers. Two major events in 1832 and 1835, known as the Anahuac Disturbances (caused mainly by rogue bandits termed \\"Texians\\" from the Brazos Valley area), helped to precipitate the Texas Revolution that led to the separation of Texas from Mexico. One of these events was the jailing by Mexican authorities of William Travis for illegal slave importation,Tucker (2010), p. 30. and the other was unfair taxation and duties on river traffic to the settlers by the Mexican authorities. In October 1830, Mexican Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn established a customs post atop the same bluff where Perry had camped. Bradburn's orders specified that the new post be named Fort Anahuac.Henson (1982), p. 51. The soldiers erected two large kilns to produce bricks to build a more permanent fort. Fort Anahuac would still be intact today had it not been for the locals stealing the bricks and using them for their own home construction soon after the Texas Revolution; virtually all bricks were taken and none remain to this day. By March 1831, Anahuac comprised 20 houses and seven stores.Edmondson (2000), p. 147. The town grew quickly. Soldiers were given 25 cents per day to use for food and other supplies, and they spent the money locally. By June 1, the town comprised over 300 civilians and 170 military personnel.Epperson (1998), p. 438. In 1862, a small Confederate outpost was established nearby. The 1935 discovery of the Anahuac Oil Field and the Monroe City area oil field brought a period of economic development. The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge was established southeast of the city in 1963 by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1989, the local chamber of commerce organized the first Gatorfest, which attracted 14,000 people into the Fort Anahuac Park, and it has been held annually since then. The festival has expanded every year since, and in 2010 hosted the largest festival, with more than 30,000 people attending.

The population was 2,198 at the 2010 census. Geography Beach City is located in western Chambers County at (29.702527, -94.862789), extending for along the northwest shore of Trinity Bay. The city is southeast to east of Baytown. According to the United States Census Bureau, Beach City has a total area of , all of it land. Historical development With the boom economy after World War II, people had time and money for recreation. People from Baytown especially began to take advantage of the drawbridge and built small summer/weekend houses or \\"fishing camps\\" along the shoreline of the present Beach City. By the early 1950s, they had nicknamed FM-2354 \\"Tri-City Beach Road\\", because the present Baytown resulted from a merger of three smaller towns in 1948. However, a number who came for recreation decided to stay. By the early 1960s the community commonly called Tri-City Beach had about 500 permanent residents. At that time, the Texas legislature began to consider annexation reform. Previously, Texas municipalities had almost unfettered power to annex adjacent lands. Cities could control vast territories by annexing ten-feet-wide strips surrounding them. During that period, Baytown controlled an area larger than the California city of Los Angeles did. Larger cities could even annex smaller cities, after they had annexed to surround them. Knowing that reform was pending, many cities began a flurry of annexations. Defensively, a number of unincorporated communities began proceedings to incorporate as municipalities. The Tri-City Beach community was one of those. On April 6, 1963, the Tri-City Beach Civic Association was formed. They met to discuss ways to better their community. The officers were Hayden Harper, a local grocer, President; Nina Harper, Secretary; Georgia Mackrell, Chairman of Publicity; and John Jennings, Chairman of the Membership Committee. The association explored a number of ideas, including the construction of a breakwater, and then began considering incorporation as a city. An Incorporation Committee was formed consisting of George Armer, Ruth Hoover, Eloice Jordan, J.D. Nicholson, and Bill White. Ms. Jordan met with County Judge Oscar F. Nelson, Jr. on March 8, 1966, and presented him with a petition for an incorporation election. On March 24, 1966, the Baytown City Council adopted Ordinance 788, consenting to the inclusion of an unspecified part of what Baytown then claimed as its extraterritorial jurisdiction within the proposed new municipality to be known as the City of Beach City. On April 5, 1966, an election was held to determine if the area would become a municipality. The results were 103 for incorporation to 4 opposed. The incorporation of Beach City was finalized by a decree issued by Judge Nelson on April 11, 1966. To prevent annexation by the nearby city of Baytown, this community voted in April 1966 to become incorporated.BEACH CITY, TX  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) An election was held on May 21, 1966, to select the first municipal officers. Eloice Jordan was elected mayor. W.D. Bush, Alvin J. Crawley, William D. Daniel, J.R. Holland, and J.D. Nicholson were chosen as aldermen for the first city council. Gus Dauzat became the first city marshal. Later Ruth Hoover was appointed by the Council as city secretary and Claude Galloway as deputy marshal. The mayors of the city have been (by date of election): *Eloice Jordan - April 6, 1968 *Jimmy McClellan - April 7, 1970 *Herschel Scott - April 27, 1976 *Jim Ainsworth - May, 1982 *A.R. \\"Rusty\\" Senac - April, 1986 *James Standridge - May 26, 1992 *A.R. \\"Rusty\\" Senac - May 23, 2000 *Guido Persiani - May 25, 2004 *Billy Combs - May 8, 2010 The Beach City Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1967 and still exists. A Tri-City Beach Emergency Medical service organization had been formed before the city's incorporation and has since been merged into a county-wide emergency medical service. With Baytown's concurrence, Beach City increased its area on August 19, 1968, by annexing approximately near Point Barrow Road and taking in McCollum Park. The 1968 annexation moved the northern boundary of the city to Lawrence Road. This annexation brought into the city limits the historic home site of early pioneer Solomon Barrow (1801‚Äì1858), whose land included the area where McCollum Park is now located. The park, as a matter of record, contains the last resting place of Barrow, his wife Elizabeth Winfree, and Barton Clark, the first husband of their daughter Narcissa Ophelia Henrietta Jane Barrow. On October 27, 1970, again with Baytown's concurrence, Beach City annexed the area where the Beach City Community Building and the Beach City VFD fire station are located. That is the only part of the city limits that extends west of FM-2354. Meanwhile, there were rumors that Baytown intended to annex the community of Cove. On September 22, 1970, Beach City received a petition of 84 residents of Cove to annex the community. The mayor of Beach City at the time was Jimmy McClellan. On November 24, 1970, Beach City annexed Cove, an area bounded generally on the west by FM-2354, on the east by the Old and Lost Rivers, on the south by Lawrence Road, and on the north by a line just north of FM-565. On December 2, 1970, Beach City extended its Cove annexation to include the property where the old Cove Community Building sits. This time Baytown did not concur. In 1971, Baytown sued Beach City in an attempt to stop the annexation of Cove. In 1973, Beach City released its claim to what are now the city limits of Cove. An incorporation election was held and the City of Cove was incorporated on May 23, 1973. Leroy Stevens was Cove's first mayor. The City Council of Beach City presented to Mayor Stevens Cove's first municipal seal, which is believed to be the one still in use.

Cuney operates the sixth-worst offending speed trap in Texas, generating an annual average of $319,117, or $2,279 per town resident, from speeding citations issued along a small stretch of U.S. Highway 175. Cuney was the only \\"wet\\" town in Cherokee County from the mid-1980s until 2009, when voters in Rusk came out in favor of beer/wine sales. After that result, voters in Jacksonville and Frankston have since voted in favor of beer/wine sales, and Rusk voters returned to the polls to vote in favor of liquor sales. As of 2020, only one liquor store remains in Cuney. Geography Cuney is located at (32.034127, -95.417769).

He arrived in 1870. A community did not develop until 1902, when the site became a flag stop on the Texas and New Orleans Railroad, which became part of the Southern Pacific system in 1961. Around 1914, Palestine cashier H.L. Price and several local investors formed a company and platted a town site. They named the town Cuney, after Price's son, Cuney Price, who in turn had been named for Norris Wright Cuney, a prominent black politician and head of the state's Republican Party. A post office was established in 1917 and a number of businesses were operating in the community by the early 1920s. With the paving of State Highway 40 in 1929, which would eventually become U.S. Highway 175, most of the businesses moved a mile north of the railroad to take advantage of the increased traffic. The population was estimated at 100 in 1929, but declined to only 25 by the mid-1930s. A number of businesses closed after World War II as agricultural prices decreased and residents moved to other cities with greater employment opportunities.

History The area was first settled in the late 1840s, but a community did not develop until 1902, when the Texas and New Orleans Railroad (T&NO;) was built through the area. John W. Chandler and his sister, Sophronia, who owned the surrounding land, asked Rusk attorney C. H. Martin to survey a townsite. Chandler named the new town Gallatin, after his hometown of Gallatin, Tennessee. The new community, located in a large truck- farming area, quickly developed into a market for tomatoes and other produce. The construction in 1907 of a branch line of the T&NO; between Gallatin and Rusk further enhanced the town as a shipping center. By 1914 Gallatin had a population of 350, several churches, two general stores, a drugstore, a school, and a cotton gin. In 1916, virtually the entire business district was destroyed by fire, but the town was quickly rebuilt, and as late as the mid-1930s it reported 500 residents and five businesses. After World War II, the community steadily declined. Its school was consolidated with the Rusk schools in the 1950s, and many of the town's businesses closed. The population fell to 350 by the early 1950s, and in 1990 only 171 residents and two stores were reported there. Nevertheless, Gallatin was incorporated in the early 1980s.

The population was 790 at the 2010 census. Wells is served by ZIP Code 75976 and the 867 exchange in Area Code 936. Geography Wells is located at (31.490395, -94.940950). Wells is in the southernmost tip of Cherokee County in East Texas approximately south of Tyler and north of Lufkin on U.S. 69. Nacogdoches is Northeast, Dallas is to the north and west while Houston is to the south and west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.  History  Wells is at the junction of U.S. Highway 69 and Farm Road 1247, twenty-three miles south of Rusk in extreme southern Cherokee County. It was established in 1885 as a stop on the newly constructed Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad and was named for Maj. E. H. Wells, a civil engineer for the railroad. A post office opened in 1886, and by 1890 the town had a sawmill, a hotel, a Methodist church, three general stores, and a population of fifty. Shortly after the railroad was completed, the state penitentiary established a satellite camp just outside the town to produce charcoal for the state-run iron works at Rusk. The presence of the prison camp discouraged many potential settlers, and the town's population remained small until after 1900, when the charcoal camp was closed. During the 1910s, however, the town boomed; the First State Bank of Wells opened in 1913, and the following year the population reached 300. During the 1920s the community incorporated, and in 1936 Wells reported 475 residents and twenty businesses. The population continued to grow after World War II, rising to 761 by 1990. Over the same period, however, the number of businesses has gradually declined, falling from twenty-six in 1952 to seven in 1990. Farming, cattle ranching, and lumber are the principal industries.Cherokee County History (Jacksonville, Texas: Cherokee County Historical Commission, 1986)John N. Cravens, Between Two Rivers: A History of Wells, Texas (Wichita Falls: Humphrey Printing, 1974)Hattie Joplin Roach, A History of Cherokee County (Dallas: Southwest, 1934)Christopher Long  Education  Lack of transportation forced most children to walk to school, so for that reason small schoolhouses were scattered at five-mile (8 km) intervals throughout Cherokee county. About 50 of these schoolhouses existed in the county in the 1870s. These schools were usually located in a church or a one-room building. Many of these small community schools sprang up near saw mills and other operations. The earliest schools in the Wells vicinity were at Shook's Bluff, Mt. Hope, Pleasant Hill, Damascus, Forest and Sweet Union communities. In 1884, boundaries were redrawn and 69 new school districts were formed in Cherokee County. Historic railroad depot in Wells, Texas The Shook's Bluff school, located near Shook's Bluff Cemetery, was operating in 1861. It was a crude, one-room, unpainted building. By 1920 people began to move away from the Neches River communities and closer to Wells, so the Shook's Bluff school was relocated two miles (3 km) west of Wells. Three teachers employed at that school were Vinnie Solley, Nora McClain, and Effie Wesley. Shook's Bluff school finally consolidated with Wells school in 1928. Forest School was established in 1888 in the Forest Baptist Church, and later occupied a separate building on a lot donated by J. S. Derrough, Jeff Latham, and Hugh Henry. In 1922, Forest School consolidated with the Wildhurst School from the Chronister Lumber Company Camp and a new building was built on the old Jim Hogg Highway north of the Baptist Church in Forest. The new building housed the elementary and three unaccredited high school grades. Forest School consolidated with Wells ISD in 1949. There were two Mt. Hope Methodist church schools. The first school was established in 1875 and the first teachers were H.S.P. Espie and John Clifford. The other Mt. Hope school consisted of a single 20 x 20 room and all grades were taught by one teacher. Classes were held for three months in the winter and during two summer sessions. Nathan Fulton, the first teacher, was paid $40 a month for his services. Other teachers were Jasper Starling, Asilee Hyde, Charlie Bowden, Quarles McClure, and George B. Terrell. When Wells began to prosper as a result of the Kansas and Gulf Short Line Railroad reaching the town in 1885, the Mt. Hope school was moved to the Methodist church in town. Classes later moved to a two-story brick building on the present school site. That building burned in 1917 and was replaced by a similar structure build on the original faulty foundation. When a crack appeared in the back wall a few years later, the school was reduced to a single story. About that time Damascus and Crossroads schools consolidated with Wells and three high school grades were added. Wells Independent School District was formed on June 12, 1921. The first school trustees were W. D. Lewis, Jr., Rube Sessions, W. T. Hunt, R. N. Falvey, T.B. Warner, J. W. Ellerbee, and Steve Cherry. The first superintendent was Hugh Stegall. The federal census showed Wells with a population of 475 when the first four-year high school class graduated in 1930. The school was accredited by the Texas Education Agency in 1934. As transportation facilities continued to improve, all the county's small school districts were gradually absorbed into the 5 school districts that exist today: Wells, Alto, Rusk, Jacksonville, and New Summerfield.Cherokee County History.

The population was 6,905 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Childress County. The city and county were named in honor of George Campbell Childress, a native of Nashville, Tennessee, who was the principal author of the Texas Declaration of Independence. The county and city were incorporated more than four decades after Childress's death.H. W. Brands, Lone Star Nation (Anchor Books, 2005), In December 2015, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer voted Childress ninth among the ten \\"most conservative\\" cities in the United States in regard to political contributions. Other West Texas communities in the most conservative lineup are Hereford (No. 1), Monahans (No. 5), and Dalhart in Dallam County in the far northwestern Texas Panhandle (No. 8). Princeton in Collin County north of Dallas ranked No. 2. In contrast, Vashon Island, Washington was named the \\"most liberal\\" city in the nation in terms of political donations. History Map of the city in 1890 Childress developed from two rival townships, Childress and Henry, which were about four miles (six km) apart on the former OX Ranch. Childress County was organized in February 1887 with the arrival of the Fort Worth and Denver Railway. An election was held on April 11, 1887 to determine which town would be the county seat with Childress prevailing. A temporary wooden courthouse was constructed under the supervision of the prominent attorney Amos J. Fires. However, the Donley County court, to which Childress County was still attached for judicial purposes, declared the election illegal. R. E. Montgomery, the right-of-way and townsite agent for the railroad, favored the Henry location because it had a smoother terrain than Childress, a situation which would make the erection of a depot easier. Montgomery had also purchased half of the property in Henry. When Henry was chosen county seat in another election, Montgomery and Fires compromised. The name of \\"Henry\\" was simply changed to \\"Childress\\", and the businesses and residences were relocated by September 1887.Handbook of Texas Online - CHILDRESS, TX The railroad built the Dwight Hotel, the section house, and the depot. The Childress Lumber Company followed. J. H. Christler became the first practicing physician in Childress. Amos Fires was elected county judge, a combined judicial and administrative position. He opened the first bank and initiated the county's public school system. In 1888, James S. Harrison launched the Childress County Index (later Childress Index), the first newspaper in the community. By 1889, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Church of Christ congregations had been organized. The city was incorporated in 1890 with a population of 621. It had a post office, a restaurant, a livery stable, a boardinghouse, three stores, a Young Men's Christian Association facility, and a theater. There were also several saloons in Childress until 1904, when a fatal shooting prompted Childress to adopt local prohibition of alcoholic beverages. The large Childress Hotel operates with limited clientele. In 1901, when the Fort Worth and Denver City railroad began considering Childress as a division point, Childress voters approved bonds and donated land to build shops and terminal facilities. These businesses, in addition to the influx of farmers and homesteaders, provided more jobs and resulted in a considerable increase in population‚Äîto 5,003 by 1910. Future automobile tycoon Walter P. Chrysler served as general foreman of the Childress railroad shops from 1905 to 1906. He then relocated to Iowa, where he worked as a master mechanic before he founded Chrysler Motor Corporation. After a fire destroyed the first Childress County courthouse in 1891, a new stone building was constructed and used until 1939, when the present structure was built. On the courthouse grounds is a memorial to 20th century military veterans, a tribute paid in many Texas counties. For decades, a large windmill on Main Street provided municipal water. The railroad remained the economic center of Childress into the 1940s. Extension of the Fort Worth and Denver railroad to Pampa, the seat of Gray County in the Panhandle, ameliorated the hardships of the Great Depression in Childress. In 1941, citizens appealed to the Interstate Commerce Commission to stop the railroad from closing its shops in Childress. In the 1920s a brick high school building was completed. In 1929, the Childress News appeared in competition with the Childress Index. In 1942, the News was leased by the Index. In 1947, the Childress Reporter was established. After the depression and Dust Bowl era, modern farm machinery and improved highways reduced the rate of growth in Childress. The population was 6,464 in 1940. The railroad closed several shops, which were eventually razed. Lanchart Industries, Royal Park Fashions, and Fiberglass Corporation of America supplanted the railroad as the economic anchor of Childress. The population decreased from 6,399 in 1960 to 5,817 by 1980. Childress remains an agribusiness center with cotton gins and grain elevators. The first successful oil well in the area was not drilled until 1961. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

It is part of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,141 at the 2010 census, a decline of 123 from the 2000 tabulation of 3,264. History U.S. Route 287 has long been a key traffic artery in Henrietta. Hanging exhibit at the Clay County 1890 Jail Museum in Henrietta, though no executions were conducted at the old jail. Sleeping guard exhibit at Clay County 1890 Jail Museum A portion of Henrietta The First Baptist Church at 208 S. Graham Street in Henrietta was originally established in 1876. In 2013, the church had more than 1,300 members. Henrietta is one of the oldest settled towns in north central Texas. It sits at the crossroads of U.S. Highway 287, U.S. Highway 82, State Highway 148, and Farm to Market Road 1197 in north central Clay County. Clay and Montague counties were separated in 1857 from Cooke County to the east, and Henrietta was named as the county seat. The naming of the town remains a mystery, though several explanations have been offered. Regardless of the origin of its name, Henrietta became the center of gravity for the fledgling county. In 1860, as the only town in the county, it had 109 residents, 10 houses, and a general store. It sat at the far western edge of Anglo expansion in north-central Texas, but Native Americans remained a viable threat to current and future settlers. In 1862, Henrietta opened its post office. In the early 1860s, there were continuous attacks from local tribes. By late 1862, Henrietta was abandoned, and white settlers returned east to Cooke and Montague counties. Remaining structures were burned. Anglos continued to attempt resettlement, and in 1865 after the Civil War, a group attempting resettlement was massacred. A number of Quakers attempted to reoccupy the former townsite, but its members were either killed or fled. In 1870, fifty soldiers and Kiowa Indians fought a battle in the ruins of Henrietta. After the battle, white settlers returned to Henrietta, this time permanently. In 1874, the post office reopened, and Henrietta quickly became the economic hub of north-central Texas. In 1882, the Fort Worth and Denver Railway reached Henrietta on its southern side, and in 1887, Henrietta became the westernmost terminus for the Gainesville, Henrietta, and Western Railway. In 1895, the Wichita Falls Railway, one of the properties of Joseph A. Kemp and Frank Kell, linked Henrietta with Wichita Falls; sold in 1911, this segment was operated thereafter by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, known as the Katy. This particular track was abandoned in 1970. MK&T; then built in Wichita Falls a station, offices, a roundhouse, and three switching tracks. After heavy lobbying by businessmen, Henrietta became a logistical supply point for various operations in north-central Texas, including mining in Foard and Archer counties. The Southwestern Railway Company in 1910 completed a rail linking Henrietta with Archer City. An antiques shop occupies part of the building which once housed the St. Elmo Hotel, long ago destroyed in a fire. The U.S. Post Office is located in the southeast corner of Courthouse Square in Henrietta. Though it had been settled earlier, Henrietta did not incorporate until 1881. The Clay County courthouse was built in 1884 and is still in use. By 1890, the population had reached 2,100, and the town boasted a 400-seat opera house, five churches, a new jailhouse, and a school. From 1893 to 1895, it had a college - Henrietta Normal College - for the training of teachers. It remained the economic hub of the county at the turn of the 20th century. The St. Elmo Hotel, established about 1895 in Henrietta, had among its guests Quanah Parker, who married two of his wives there, and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, when he toured the North Texas area. When the top floors of the hotel burned, the facility closed and never reopened. A portion of the lower floor now houses an antiques store. The growth of Henrietta waned in the 20th century as Wichita Falls grew rapidly into the most prosperous economic center in the area. The Southwestern Railway line was abandoned in 1920, and the Gainesville, Henrietta, and Western Railway line closed in 1969. By 1990, the population remained under 3,000.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 2,006. This represented a 10.8% population decline since the 2000 Census. History Famous cattle baron Christopher C. Slaughter died in 1919, and in 1921, his heirs dissolved his cattle company. Slaughter's eldest daughter, Minnie Slaughter Veal, hired an agent to sell her share of the property, and this agent - named Morton Smith - founded the town of Morton. In 1923, the townsite was platted, and Smith's land office was on the east side of the square. In 1924, Morton became the county seat over a town called Ligon. The Slaughters had founded Ligon and were hoping that it would become county seat. Cochran County's western boundary is along the Texas - New Mexico border. Ranches continued to be sold as farmland throughout the 1920s. According to the Handbook of Texas, a family named Winder was so large that it doubled the population of Morton. Mrs. Mary Winder served as Morton's first postmistress (1924‚Äì1943). Since Cochran County was one of the last in the state to be broken out into farmland and settled, the motto for Morton became \\"The Last Frontier\\". Morton was spared the fate of many Texas towns that shriveled and died after being bypassed by the railroad during the 1930s and 1940s. Morton being the county seat, plus having all that former rangeland newly broken out into farmland, attracted many new farming families to move in during that time, and helped Morton not only survive, but also to grow and thrive. In 1933, Morton was incorporated, with Henry Cox as the town's first mayor. Morton was the hometown of Lt. Col. George Andrew Davis, Jr., a World War II ace who was killed in the Korean War.

The town of Robert Lee is located on the Colorado River. Just upstream from the town is E.V. Spence Reservoir, managed by the Colorado River Municipal Water District. From the mid-1960s until approximately 1996, the reservoir's population of striped bass attracted sportsmen from across the southwestern U.S., providing significant income to the town. In the late 1990s, however, water use policies changed and the reservoir water levels were continually lowered until the striped bass population could no longer be sustained. In addition to a once-great fishery, the area around Robert Lee supports a significant population of white-tailed deer, which can be a nuisance to local ranchers and farmers, but attracts large numbers of hunters during the annual hunting seasons. A very diverse set of wildlife occurs in the area, both native and migratory.

According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Santa Anna has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps.Climate Summary for Santa Anna, Texas History The twin mesas in central Coleman County have always been a landmark. One of the earliest maps of Texas shows a mountain near the center of the state with the notation, \\"Santa Anna's Peaks.\\" The mountain and later the town were named for the Comanche war chief Santanna, or Santa Anna. Texas Rangers camped at the foot of the mountain long before the area was settled. Cattle drives from South Texas to the northern markets passed through the gap in the mountain along a military road. This road helped supply the outpost forts along the Texas Forts Trail. The first permanent European-American settlers soon built homes near a freshwater spring at the foot of the mountain. One enterprising settler stocked a supply of goods for trail drivers and settlers, starting the first business at \\"The Gap\\" in the early 1870s. In 1879, a petition to open a post office was filed, and the name of \\"Santa Anna\\" was chosen. During the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad, a group of residents bought land along the right-of-way. Stone buildings were built from limestone quarried from the cap rock of the west mountain. Several businesses moved from Trickham and Brownwood to be a part of the new community. In 1886, The Santa Anna News was established. The first telephone in the county was a private line from Brownwood to Coleman, connected in the Melton Hotel in Santa Anna. A small local exchange was opened in 1892. A drugstore and a bank were opened in the 1880s, and a one-room school was opened that soon expanded to four rooms. As the open range was preempted and sold, land was cultivated, with cotton the principal crop. Santa Anna eventually had four cotton gins in operation, and was also a major rail shipping point for livestock. The town became a trade center with a thriving business district that included drugstores, hotels, banks, livery stables, and produce houses. One of the early buildings, still a landmark downtown, housed an opera house, where traveling groups and local performers provided entertainment and culture. After World War I, Dr. T.R. Sealy established a hospital that soon became widely known. A nursing school was founded in the 1920s to provide trained nurses, continuing until the death of Dr. Sealy in the mid-1930s.1 During the first half of the 20th century, Santa Anna thrived as a small farming and ranching community. It later developed businesses related to the area oil industry. Since the beginning of the 21st century, tourism has emerged as a new industry in Santa Anna. Currently, 38 businesses are located in Santa Anna, of which 13 are less than three years old. Custom hand-crafted furniture has become a hallmark of the city. Other popular draws include a steakhouse, Dairy Queen, numerous antique stores, furniture stores, and specialty shops. Santa Anna and the surrounding area are also popular among dove, quail, turkey, and deer hunters.

By the time Anna was platted in 1883, it had a population of 20, two stores, a steam gristmill, and a Baptist church. A post office also opened in that year. In 1885, the railroad built a depot. By 1890 the town had a population of nearly 200. Anna was incorporated in 1913, with John L. Greer as first mayor. Local historian Chester A. Howell compiled a brief history of Anna for inclusion in a book, A Town Named Anna,A Town Named Anna that was given to those who attended the Anna school homecoming on October 19, 1985. A one-page list of errata to correct some minor errors was added in 1989. In 2019, the Anna Area Historical Preservation Society published, The Spark That Ignited The Town Of Anna (), a collection of stories and pictures of early Anna, Texas. First Christian Church of Anna First Christian Church of Anna (n√©e, Liberty Christian Church), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J.B. Wilmeth in 1846. Liberty Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), one of the earliest Christian Churches in Texas, was founded in northern Collin County by pioneer settlers Collin McKinney and J. B. Wilmeth in 1846. In 1854 a Christian seminary was established by members of the Liberty congregation about two miles northwest of Anna in the (then) newly established community of Mantua. The Houston and Texas Central Railway extended its track in a north‚Äìsouth route several miles east of Mantua in 1872. Mantua soon declined in favor of the new railroad towns of Van Alstyne (Grayson County) and Anna which developed here in early 1880s. According to local tradition Mantua's Christian congregation split between the two new communities. Former Mantua church members and early Anna resident Rebecca Sherley helped organize the First Christian Church of Anna in 1882. The Rev. Alf Douglas served as first Pastor. Services were held in the Sherley home until it burned in 1886. About 1890 the sanctuary was built here at the site of the former Sherley home. Major additions to the rear of the sanctuary were completed in 1949. A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store A. Sherley and Brothers Hardware Store Lewis and Pauline Sherley moved to north Texas from Kentucky about 1853. When the town of Anna was established in 1872, their grandsons, brothers Andrew and Fred Sherley, opened a hardware store. In 1894 they built this structure to house the business. It remained in the family after the store closed in 1979. Over time they were undertakers as well as purveyors of furniture, farming implements and machinery, wagons, cotton, grain and groceries. Wagon-weighing scales in front of the building were removed when the road was widened. The structure is a fine example of an early Texas commercial building, retaining the original canopy and painted signs. Minimal Victorian-era detailing includes corbelled brickwork in the parapet and paneled kickplates on storefront display windows. Tornado On May 9, 2006, a storm producing two tornadoes swept across Anna, with the first tornado (F0) passing east of the high school, barely missing the incorporated city limits. The second tornado (F3) touched down in neighboring Westminster and Whitewright, destroying many homes and killing three. During the disaster, several volunteers from Collin County Amateur Radio Services worked with the National Weather Service in a Skywarn net. The Anna police and fire departments along with the American Red Cross opened Anna High School up as a shelter to the \\"walking wounded\\" and anyone who needed a place to stay due to the road blockages and damage in that area. The tornadoes could be seen from Anna, Van Alstyne, and Melissa, and power was knocked out to several homes in the area.

History Some of Melissa's first settlers came from the old Highlands community, two and a half miles north of present-day Melissa. C.H. Wysong was one of the earliest settlers. A post office was established in 1853. The Houston and Texas Central Railroad arrived in Melissa in 1872. The town was laid out at this time. The railroad encouraged many families to come to Melissa. The town is believed to have been named for the daughter of a railroad executive, George A. Quinlan (1838‚Äì1901) of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. There is some disagreement about this, as others argue that the town was named after Melissa Huntington, daughter of C. P. Huntington, another well-known railroad executive. Anna, Texas, is named after Anna Elizabeth Quinlan (1878‚Äì1952), the only daughter of George Austin Quinlan and his wife Mary Kate Saunders (1851‚Äì1884). Quinlan, Texas, is named after George Austin Quinlan himself. thumb The first school in Melissa was built on land purchased in 1882 by trustees James Graves, John Gibson, and George Fitzhugh, who were early settlers of the area. The first teacher was Mary Huckerston, who taught there for five years. The school began with 38 pupils. Church services were held there for all faiths on Sundays. A two-story brick schoolhouse was built on this site in 1910 to accommodate growth brought by the railroad. Melissa was an important shipping point in the early 1900s. Corn, wheat, alfalfa hay, wood, and livestock were all sent out on the railroad. A deadly tornado struck Melissa on April 13, 1921, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The tornado tore the roof off of the brick school building, but the children inside were not seriously injured. However, all churches in the town, three cotton gins, every business house except a bank, the post office, and the Houston and Texas Central railway station, were wrecked. The Waldon Hotel was lifted by the winds, turned halfway around, and thrown up against the school building. Eight years later, on August 8, 1929, a fire burned down many of the buildings that had been rebuilt after the tornado. Population declined from a high of 500 in 1925 down to 285 in 1949. Pioneers who settled in or near Melissa Dr. William Throckmorton, R.E. Moore, G.W. Taylor, T.M. Scott, John and William Fitzhugh, Albert Sherley, Lewis Shirley, James M. Graves, Hogan Witt, John Coffman, Thomas Rattan, Josiah Nichols, Jesse Martin, John M. Nicholson, Lindsey Lewis, J.M. Kincaid, and the Orenduffs. References * Billie L.

The 2018 census reported the population as 20,611, compared to 3,099 in 2000. Murphy is located northeast of Dallas and has a history that goes back to the late 1800s. Geography Murphy is located in southern Collin County, within the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Situated midway between Plano and Wylie on FM 544, Murphy is south of the famous Southfork Ranch. Murphy shares borders with Plano to the west, Richardson to the southwest, Sachse to the south, Wylie to the east, and Parker to the north. It is northeast of downtown Dallas and about east of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The community supports plans to continue to foster the country-living atmosphere, though with fewer large lots. Minimum lot sizes are , and the average lot size trends toward . Several subdivisions have begun building and are occupied. The newest approved development is on the northeast side of the city along Maxwell Creek. The country living theme is expressed in this development by a linear park, which is expected to include a hike-and-bike trail. The major new feature to be noted in the Future Land Use Plan is a central business district at the northeast and northwest corners of the intersection of FM 544 and Murphy Road. This is expected to encompass a park-like area with offices and stores fronting on a central plaza. Construction on such a development, Murphy Marketplace, began in 2008. It now contains numerous restaurants and services. The municipal complex comprises a total of five buildings to serve Fire, Police, City Administration, and Public Works, as well as a 2014 addition of the PSA Murphy sports center. With the opening of the President George Bush Turnpike, access to the west became a reality in 1999. The highway is a major factor in the growth of the economy of southeast Collin County. Its impact on Murphy has already been felt in the rapid expansion as new homes have been built, with the boom starting in 1999. The population in late 2002 was about 6,500 and continued to grow to around 12,000 in 2006. The 2010 census reported a population of 17,708. The city was rated #7 in the \\"Best Places to Live\\" survey of Dallas Suburbs in the July 2008 D Magazine, and #9 in the 2010 edition of the article. (By comparison Dallas was #54, and neighboring Plano was #18.) In 2011 the city was rated #27 in America by \\"Money's list of America's best small towns\\".Money's list of America's best small towns 2011 In 2017 Murphy was ranked #2 among over 35,000 US cities and towns, without regard to size, by the \\"Area Vibes\\" web site.http://www.areavibes.com/murphy- tx/livability/ According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.08%, is water. History Attracted by the offer of land grants from the Peters colony, the first settlers of the community arrived in the area in 1846. The original townsite, located on land owned by C. A. McMillen, was first called \\"Old Decator\\", after McMillen's hometown, and later, \\"Maxwell's Branch\\". When the St. Louis Southwestern Railway reached the area in 1888, the residents renamed the town \\"Murphy\\", in honor of William Murphy, who provided land for the tracks and the construction of a depot. A post office was established there in 1891. From the 1880s until the 1950s Murphy served as a shipping point for area farmers and stock raisers. The Great Depression, the mechanization of farming, and job opportunities in the Dallas metropolitan area contributed to a decline in the population of Murphy. Though the rural community was never very large, its population was reduced to 150 by the mid-1950s and to 135 by 1961. Mail service was discontinued in 1954. Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, the population increased dramatically. The establishment of businesses in nearby Plano and Richardson made Murphy a commuter community for these two cities. In 1970 there were 136 residents reported in Murphy. That figure had risen to 1,547 in 1990. Few reminders of Murphy's early heyday remain; one structure still in use is the First Baptist Church of Murphy, built in 1901. Although the business district faded out, the school system remained for some time. The school building served as a community center in 1987. A school building which housed elementary and high school students was built in 1938 as a WPA project. When it closed in 1950, the schoolchildren transferred to Plano. Later, citizens renovated the school building, which became the Community Center, Fire Station, and City Hall. The Fire Station is named after local businessman and Level III Sommelier John A. Wisniowski. Later, the City Hall and Fire Station were moved to a new complex across the road, leaving the old building to be renovated as the Community Center that reopened in February 2012. Climate Murphy is considered to be part of the humid subtropical region. Government The city of Murphy adopted a Home Rule Charter in 2003, and the power of the city is vested in a council of elected individuals who regulate and legislate and appoint other officials, such as the City Manager, who heads the executive branch. The council members as of 2017 are Scott Bradley (Mayor), Jene Butler, Jennifer Berthiaume, Rob Thomas, Sarah Fincannon, Ken Oltmann and Elizabeth Abraham. Scott Bradley was elected mayor in 2017. Mike Castro is the city manager. NBC Dateline deal The Murphy police department made a deal with \\"Dateline\\" in 2006 to allow NBC camera crews to record stings of alleged Internet sexual predators and to let people hired by \\"Dateline\\" actually set up and run the sting. The production ended tragically when one of the alleged offenders, Louis Conradt, an assistant district attorney from a neighboring county, committed suicide when Dateline NBC cameras showed up at his home in the company of Murphy police after the man failed to show up to the sting house.

The population was 822 at the 2010 census. First settled in 1835 by John McMinn Stambaugh and named \\"McMinn Chapel\\", the area was settled by Granville Stinebaugh, who named it after the Nevada Territory. Nevada enjoyed some prosperity after becoming a stop on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, and the town incorporated in 1889. On 9 May 1927, a half-mile-wide F4 tornado ripped through Nevada, leaving 19 dead, 100 injured, and property damage exceeding $650,000. The town had a difficult recovery; citizens voted to unincorporate, and placed the restoration of the community in the hands of the Collin County authorities. However, the growing mechanisation involved in agriculture, along with the Great Depression, caused the town to fall into stagnation. The railroad later removed its tracks from the area. Recent growth in Collin County during the last 25 years has moderately improved life in Nevada. The population has again reached the heights of 1927, and the town reincorporated in 1988.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,807. History In the late 1870s T. B. Wilson and his brother George began farming near the site of future Princeton. In 1881 the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad Company extended its line from Greenville to McKinney, passing through land owned by the brothers. The name \\"Wilson's Switch\\" was commonly used to designate the area. When residents applied for a post office branch, however, they learned that the name Wilson was already being used. The community then submitted the name \\"Princeton\\" in honor of Prince Dowlin, a landowner and promoter of the town. This name was accepted, and a post office was established in 1888. In 1940, a camp of 76 cabins was built west of Princeton to house up to 400 migrant workers, who came to work during the onion and cotton seasons. In February 1945, the site became a prisoner-of-war camp for German prisoners captured during the Second World War. The local farmers paid the POWs to work on their farms. This operation continued for eight months. Under a special bill, the German prisoners were contracted to work on the City Park located across from city hall. The park was built as a living memorial and shrine to those who served and died during World War II. The Community Park/WWII P.O.W. Camp is located at 500 West College Street. Geography On June 30, 2011, a Collin County District Court Judge issued a judgment ending a legal dispute over Princeton's southern boundary.

Case No. 401-00108-2010 The State of Texas' Motion for Summary Judgement stated \\"that Princeton administration had 'unlawfully and improperly attempted to assert jurisdiction over a tract of land which the city never annexed and which is not lawfully within the corporate city limits,' according to Collin County court records.\\" \\"Tract Five, the property in question, is a strip of land that runs the length of the right of way of Farm to Market Road 982 from about a half mile south of U.S. Highway 380 to its intersection with FM Road 546.\\" \\"The southern portion of this tract was incorporated as part of the city of Branch from August of 1971 through April of 1977.\\" \\"After three months in which no response of any kind was received from the city (of Princeton) in regard to the matter, the (approximately 100) landowners concluded that the city (of Princeton) was ignoring (them) and decided in November (of 2006) to refer the matter to the Collin County District Attorney for possible legal action.\\" The landowners \\"provided all of the documentation\\" (to the D.A.)... \\"The state's quo warranto motion, filed in November 2010, claimed that Princeton was wrongfully exercising powers not authorized by any law or statute and that a judgment on the case could be made without a trial and instead based solely on Princeton city records.\\" \\"Princeton officials first claimed the 5.5-mile strip of land as part of the city limits in 2003, but according to the state's motion, the 'contorted history of Tract Five and the City's current efforts to effectively annex by stealth began in 1971.'\\" \\"In January 1971, the city enacted Ordinance No. 104, through which Princeton attempted to annex certain right-of-ways surrounding the city by a process commonly referred to as 'strip annexation.'\\" \\"Princeton City Council passed a motion to annex five tracts, but in April of that year, the council passed another motion to eliminate Tract Five from the proposed annexations.\\" \\"Texas Legislature subsequently prohibited 'strip annexation' through procedures mandated by Chapter 43 of the Texas Local Government Code.\\" \\"All area maps, including one Princeton filed in 2000 with the U.S. Dept. of Justice, show that Tract Five did not belong to Princeton.\\" \\"Included in the state's original filing on the case in 2010 is a corporate map of Branch that was legally filed in Collin County records in March 1975, showing that Branch owns (sic) the corner of FM 982 and FM 546 and part of the same land Princeton began claiming as its own in 2003.\\" \\"Robert Davis, specially deputized District Attorney representing the state, said in the state's motion for summary judgment that 'in 2003, realizing that they were prohibited by law from engaging in the type of strip annexation which was accomplished by Ordinance No. 104, the City passed an ordinance which attempted to refute the fact that the fifth tract of land had been deleted from Ordinance No. 104 prior to final passage.' \\"The state initially brought the motion for summary judgment before Judge Mark Rusch of the 401st Judicial District Court..., but the state and Princeton decided to let Wheless rule on the case after Rusch disclosed he was a prosecutor in the Collin county District Attorney's office during a related case in 1990.\\" On February 25, 2011, Judge Mark Rusch signed the Administrative Order of Assignment, which stated, \\"...it is my opinion that the most efficient management of this case necessitates it be transferred to the 366th Judicial District Court.\\" A few days later, the case retained the same name, but was re-numbered to show that it was being decided in the 366th Judicial District Court: Case No. 366-00108-2010.The State of Texas Ex Rel.

Road 982 with U.S. Highway 380 but does NOT include the 5.5-mile stretch to FM 546.\\" \\"The order brings Princeton's south boundary back to where it stood for nearly 32 years.\\" Princeton's City Council minutes from July 11, 2011 state that \\"Councilmember Beauchamp made a motion to not appeal the Quo Warranto, Case No. 401-00108-2010.

Government Princeton is a Type A General Law city, but its council members have tried to get a Home Rule form of government passed four times: in November 2007, May 2008, November 2008, and May 2014. Princeton voters rejected Home Rule each time: 149 to 117 in November 2007, 239 to 165 in May 2008, 979 to 449 in November 2008, and 260 to 151 in May 2014. In Jan. 2015, a year long transparency study of 113 area cities, counties, and school districts was completed by The Dallas Morning News. Seven reporters sent out and tracked 565 open record requests for public information from 113 entities. They asked for public information that was clearly allowed by law. They also tested government websites to see if they were user-friendly for citizen inspection. Grades ranged from A to F. Princeton was among only three cities which earned an F. By contrast, twenty-four neighboring cities earned an A. If a government did poorly on this survey, it is a cause for citizen concern, because responding to open records requests is a basic function of government. Cities were graded according to their responses. The City of \\"Princeton was among the worst in the Transparency 2015 ratings. It ranked as bad in request best practices, bad in request compliance, good in web customer service and excellent in online meeting notice.\\" Finances A Fitch business report for Princeton, dated August 31, 2018 is titled: \\"Fitch Upgrades Princeton (TX)'s IDR and Limited Tax Debt to 'AA-'; Outlook Positive.\\" The growth is \\"driven predominately by Fitch's expectation that the city will continue to maintain superior gap-closing capacity through economic cycles. The city has realized positive operating performance in five consecutive years, strengthening its financial position and resilience, as the result of improved budgeting practices and fiscal reserve policy. At the same time, the city continues to manage its growth related needs, while retaining strong revenue growth prospects, independent legal revenue raising capacity and solid expenditure flexibility. The city's long-term liability burden is elevated but moderate, with no current plans to issue debt.\\" Education The city is served by the Princeton Independent School District.

History The first settlers arrived in 1846 to farm cotton in the black fertile prairie soil. Between 1850 and 1902, two settlements existed - Rock Hill was two miles south of the present town and Richland was one mile north. The development of these small communities was expedited in 1876 when County Courts ordered small tracts of land to be established for quick sale. These tracts, each about 160 acres in size, were sold for $3.50 per acre. Dr. A. T. Bryant of McKinney purchased what later became the center of the present town. The towns merged during the establishment of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad in March 1902. For years, Prosper was the central stop for the railroad between Dallas and Sherman. When community officials applied for a post office with the name \\"Richland\\", they were informed that city name was already taken. Postmaster B.J. Naugle asked for an alternative name and J.C. Slaughter suggested the name \\"Prosper\\", because crops that year had been very prosperous. The Town of Prosper was incorporated in 1914 with a commission form of government and a population of 500. U.N. Clary was mayor and served in that position for the next 49 years. Prosper High School cost $113.5 million to construct and is 590,000 ft2, complete with a medical tech lab, a restaurant-worthy kitchen, a greenhouse, a broadcast studio, and an indoor football practice facility.

The population was 861 as of the 2010 census, up from 390 at the 2000 census, at which time it was a city. Westminster is located at the intersection of FM 3133 and FM 2862, northeast of McKinney, east of Anna, west of Leonard, north of Blue Ridge, and southeast of Van Alstyne. History The city was first settled in 1860, and named \\"Seven Points\\". It grew quickly, and by 1885 had absorbed the neighbouring communities of Prospect and Graybill. In 1888, a private school was established; the building was later sold to the Methodist Church, establishing Westminster College. The college, a preparatory school for prospective ministers, was named after Westminster, Maryland, a Methodist stronghold in an otherwise predominantly Catholic state. Within a year, the residents of Seven Points decided to change the name of their community to Westminster. The town received a post office branch in 1899, and Westminster was incorporated after a vote of 38 to 19 against, on June 17, 1916. Around the same time, the Greenville and Whitewright Northern Traction Company built a railway line from Anna to Blue Ridge that passed through Westminster. Economic and population growth followed afterward, and from the turn of the 20th century into the 1920s, Westminster served as a cotton market and trade center for local farmers. The population grew to a high of 600, with several businesses and a high school In 1920, however, the railroad line was abandoned, and other railroads bypassed the town. During the Great Depression, the population of Westminster was reduced by over half (to 268), and the town never had the renewed growth of its larger neighbors (such as Van Alstyne, Anna or Melissa); most of the town's businesses had closed by World War II. The population continued to decline until the early 1970s, when it slowly began to recover. By 1990, Westminster's population was 388. Westminster received a volunteer fire department in the 1990s. Fire department establishment started by life long resident Sam Geer. S.Geer seen a need in the small town for need in fire department response. Geer was the fire chief since the beginning until 2013 when he was made an Honorary Chief. During the night of May 9, 2006, at around 10:30 P.M., an F3 tornado swept through the small community of Westminster, leveling many homes, damaging several others, and killing 3. Several others were injured and taken to local hospitals, while the American Red Cross set up shelter at Anna High School in nearby Anna. Sirens sounded in Anna, but due to the small population, sirens are not installed in Westminster, giving no warning to its residents. The storm struck very quickly, allowing little time to prepare. Westminster High School was one of the last (if not the last) Texas school to field an eight-man football team. During the 1983 season, they beat a Dallas area team 90-0. Recent decline and disincorporation Westminster began a noticeable decline after 1988, when the Texas Board of Education, citing various deficiencies, removed the accreditation from the Westminster Independent School District. In 1989, voters abolished the district and closed its school. Most of the students in Westminster now attend school in Anna. Since that time, the city has dealt with various problems, including unresolved conflicts and lack of adequate city leadership, as well as financial difficulties and a general sense of apathy. With the hiring of a new Police Chief it was his first task to try to find out where the shortfalls were on funds. After some investigation it was found that traffic fines were directly wired into personal accounts of city officials as well as other funds had been misappropriated. At that time the Police Chief met with the FBI because of the wire transfers making it a federal crime. Also it was found that the Mayor at the time had gone around his water meter as to not have to pay his water bill which is a State Felony so the Police Chief met with the Texas Rangers to start the investigation on that. After all the meeting had taken place the Mayor and a couple of City Councilman met in an illegal meeting that same night and put the Police Chief on Administrative leave to try and thwart the investigations. Little did they know that the Police Chief knew something like that was going to happen and had made the statement to the FBI Agent working the case. When this action was reported to the FBI Agent on a Wednesday night he instructed the Police Chief to get him a sketch of City Hall and call one of his most trusted Officers to meet on the following Saturday Morning. The FBI Agent went before a Federal judge that Thursday to get a Warrant to seize everything from the city to aid in the investigation. The FBI Agent received the Warrant on Friday and put things in motion that would have a dozen Agents show up with Box trucks and vehicles to seize everything but the furniture in City Hall. The investigation turned up a value of around $365,000.00 that was missing from the city coffers. With marginal sales tax revenues, and a weak property tax base, Westminster was unable to recover from various mismanagement; embezzlement of state grant money and poor record-keeping led to a massive debt that, since 1997, had left the city seeking bankruptcy. This debt, of unpaid traffic fine revenues and a misappropriated (and unused) sewer grant, totalled over $300,000 USD. Twice, the city of Westminster sought to declare for bankruptcy; the first effort, in 2001, failed after creditors rejected a payout plan. In early 2004, the state agencies agreed to relinquish their claims, provided that Westminster disincorporate. Since then, the issue had been a debated topic in Westminster. That summer, the city council started a petition drive to gather enough signatures to place the matter of disincorporation on the ballot for the May 2005 elections. The council then proceeded to fire the city administrator, who opposed disincorporation. Those in favor of the matter, including then-mayor Phil Goplin, stated that disincorporation would keep the city from stagnating; without any cashflow or a sewer system, it is unable to attract the development of its neighboring municipalities. The residents of Westminster voted to abolish their town charter on May 7, 2005. The disincorporation of the city of Westminster was only the eleventh such occurrence in Texas since 1975. With the loss of its charter, the city retains its name as a community, but is officially an unincorporated part of Collin County. Therefore, maintenance and other services of the former city are now the responsibility of Collin County. Through an agreement with the city's creditors, the debts are considered void. Had Westminster remained incorporated after the election, the city's sales tax receipts would have been withheld until half the debt was repaid. A former city mayor was running for election, in case the vote failed. Opponents of the decision worry now of the loss of Westminster's history, as well as possible annexation from neighboring Anna. Motorcycle mecca Westminster regained recognition in 2007 after a bar, now named Big Slick's, began attracting regular crowds of motorcycle riders. Additional businesses catering to the regular weekend influx of riders have also been established. Geography Westminster is located in northeastern Collin County at .

History The city of Dodsonville was founded on July 1, 1910, by Frank Kell of Wichita Falls. The wealthy entrepreneur Kell was an important figure in promotion of the Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, and the city was established as a stop on the Wellington Branch of the railroad. Elmore Dodson, a local pioneer and rancher, donated the town site to ensure the railroad's passing through the southeastern part of the county. Other town sites had been proposed, including the community of Arlie located southwest of Dodson, but the grant given by Mr. Dodson sealed the railroad's passage through southeastern Collingsworth County. In return, the new city was named for Dodson. A celebration was held on August 29, 1910, to commemorate the town's establishment. The gala celebration, complete with a picnic, marked the town's formal opening, and was attended by a trainload of people from Oklahoma. N. L. Jones built the first residence and opened a cotton gin. The first store was operated by William T. McDowell, who was also the first postmaster. R. H. Miller established a hotel, and the town added a bank, a telephone exchange, and two churches. Three newspapers, all called the Dodsonville News, were published intermittently by three different men between January 1911 and December 1915. A fourth paper, the Dodsonville Messenger, was printed from 1928 until 1930. School was sometimes held in the churches until a permanent schoolhouse was completed in the fall of 1912; the previous school was located northwest of town. Dodson was incorporated in the 1920s and by 1930 had 25 businesses and a population of 426. Public Works Administration appropriations enabled the town to install a $52,000 water system during the 1930s, and a volunteer fire department was organized. In 1947 a new consolidated high school served neighboring communities in Oklahoma as well as Dodson. The population dropped to 357 in 1940; this decline, attributed to decreased agricultural activity and a renewed interest in cattle raising, continued into the 1990s. In 1984 Dodson remained the county's second largest town, with a population of 185, one business, and four churches. In 1990 the population was 113, and in 2000 it was 115. The city's name was officially changed from \\"Dodsonville\\" to \\"Dodson\\" on July 1, 1937. Dodson's first permanent school building was completed in 1912. This school was used until 1947 when a new school was constructed. Dodson High School continued to educated students until 1969 when the school board voted to consolidate the Dodson School District with that of Wellington. The elementary and junior high schools continued to operate until 1972. The Dodson School was destroyed in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Economy Dodson serves as an agricultural center for southeastern Collingsworth County, northeastern Childress County, Texas, and western Harmon County, Oklahoma. Cotton, wheat, sorghum, and peanuts are the primary crops of the region. There are also a large number of small ranching operations in the surrounding area. Tri-County Co-Op operates a cotton gin located in Dodson that serves the surrounding tri-county area. It is one of the town's few businesses. Education Public education in Dodson is provided by the Wellington Independent School District. Notable people Major League Baseball players Lindy McDaniel and his brother Von McDaniel were raised one mile (1.6 km) east of Dodson, across the Oklahoma state line.

The population was 2,189 at the 2010 census. History Sometime in 1889 or 1890, as smaller ranches and farmlands were being purchased, Ernest Theodore O'Neil, his brother-in-law John Simon McConnell, and John W. Swearingen, together had purchased the land upon which the town currently sits, for $5.00 per acre. Subsequently, O'Neil, who originally owned a fourth of the section of the township, purchased the interests of McConnell and Swearingen, and retained sole ownership of the land. The 1890 census showed 357 inhabitants across the county, with 89 ranches and farms and of land in cultivation. In August 1890, a petition was circulated to organize the county, choose a county seat, and elect county officers. Two potential townships were proposed: Wellington and Pearl. The proposed town of Wellington was located on the land owned by Ernest T. O'Neil who was promoting this location, and had been given its proposed name by his wife, Matilda Anna Elisabeth \\"Lizzie\\" O'Neil, who greatly admired the Duke of Wellington, hero of the Battle of Waterloo. The alternate and proposed town of Pearl was located several miles north of Wellington. In September 1890, the vote was held and Wellington was selected for the seat of the newly organized county of Collingsworth. In 1891 the new city, laid out by Ernest T. O'Neil, was surveyed and platted, and the first postal service and postmaster, Carrie M. Barton, was established on January 9, 1891. Construction of a courthouse began in 1893, and the contractor, J. A. White, built the courthouse of locally made bricks. With the extra materials left over from the courthouse, J. A. White erected a mercantile store for Ernest T. O'Neil. This became the first mercantile store and commercial building in Wellington, prior to the opening of a two-story hotel by O'Neil. Later O'Neil organized the first bank, was active in all phases of the county's growth and development, and served as postmaster from August 22, 1895 to December 11, 1897. Early in the early 20th century, Wellington was connected with Wichita Falls through the Wichita Falls and Wellington Railroad, one of the properties of the industrialist Joseph A. Kemp of Wichita Falls. In 1914, this route was leased by the since defunct Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad.

The population was 3,655 as of the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Colorado County and is located on the Colorado River. The Colorado County Courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The town motto, coined by James Harbert Wooten, Jr., M.D., is \\"City of Live Oaks and Live Folks\\". Columbus is the home of a Santa Claus Museum, based on the collection of Mary Elizabeth Hopkins. Geography It is located along Interstate 10, on the southwest side of the Colorado River.

According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Columbus has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps.Climate Summary for Columbus, Texas History Abram Alley Log Cabin (1830s); now used also as Tool Museum in Columbus A Small park commemorating Benjamin Beason's ferry and where Sam Houston camped during his retreat to San Jacinto where he defeated the Mexican Army The first American settlers arrived in 1821 on what is known as the legendary site of Montezuma's Indian village. In 1822, the Mexican government issued land grants to members of Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred, who included Benjamin Beason (originally spelled \\"Beeson\\") and Abram Alley. Alley's 1830s log cabin has been preserved in Columbus and is used as a tool museum. Beason arrived in 1821, received his land grant in 1822, and settled along the Colorado River with his wife Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" and family. By late December 1821, colonists Robert H. Kuykendall with his brother Joseph, and Daniel Gilleland arrived in the area of present-day Columbus. In 1822, Benjamin Beason began operating a ferry across the Colorado River, and the settlement became known as Beason's Ferry or Beason's Crossing. Beason also established a gristmill, gin, and a sawmill; his wife operated a boarding house. Beason's Crossing became part of Austin's San Felipe colony in 1822, when the colony was divided into two districts by the Mexican governor Jos√© F. Trespalacios. The Mexican government granted the rights to establish a town, and the locals elected town officials. John J. Tumlinson, Sr., was elected alcalde, with Robert Kuykendall captain and Moses Morrison lieutenant. Tumlinson's land adjoined Beason's; together, they made up much of the site of present-day Columbus. Tumlinson was killed by Native Americans in 1823. In 1834, after the Tumlinson children inherited the estate, they sold land to William Dewees, who was married to Beason's daughter, Lydia. Dewees' land grant was near the site of present-day Glidden, Texas. Colorado County Courthouse, built 1890-1891: this 2014 photo shows restoration to original color scheme made in 2013 Old Stafford Opera House -- Columbus, Texas Confederate Memorial Museum -- Colorado County, Texas First State Bank Building in Columbus Colorado River in Beason's Park in Columbus By 1836, Beason's Ferry Crossing was home to over 25 families. During the fight for Texas independence, Sam Houston and his men camped along the banks of the Colorado River near Beason's Crossing. Following the Battle of the Alamo, Santa Anna's army headed for San Jacinto, and Houston ordered that Beason's Crossing be burned during the Runaway Scrape. Columbus was established by European Americans in 1837 after Texas achieved independence from Mexico. After the population returned following warfare, residents renamed Beason's Crossing \\"Columbus\\". Some speculate that it was named in honor of residents who migrated from Columbus, Ohio, while others believe the town was named after Christopher Columbus, who explored on behalf of Spain in the late 15th century. The town of Columbus was platted again in 1837. The Dewees family gave land for a new school and possibly a courthouse. By 1837, the town had been re-established with two public houses, two stores, and half a dozen small dwellings. The historic Stafford-Miller House was built in 1886 for the cattleman, banker, and businessman Robert E. Stafford (1834-1890). It was later named the seat of Colorado County, and had developed as a center of business and trade for surrounding areas. Cattle ranching was big business by the late 19th century. Some merchants and ranchers did very well, and built fine houses in the city, such as the house built by Robert E. Stafford. He supported the Stafford Opera House, now serving also as a museum and performance space. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it attracted touring performers and lecturers. Other notable historic homes operated today as museums are the Dilue Rose Harris House Museum, and Tate-Senftenburg- Brandon House Museum. The Tate-Senftenburg-Brandon House, formerly owned by the Columbus Historical Preservation Trust, Inc., was sold to private owners in 2017 and is no longer operated as a museum but is being further restored and maintains its historic character. The Colorado County Courthouse was built in 1890, the fourth such structure in the city. It was designed in the Classical Revival and Italianate styles of architecture by noted Houston architect Eugene T. Heiner. He designed at least nine other Texas courthouses. The bell tower was damaged in a 1909 storm. The dome was added before 1939. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2013‚Äì2014, the courthouse was being renovated and upgraded for current uses; the project included restoration of historic exterior colors. The Santa Claus Museum in Columbus In the 20th century, the Santa Claus Museum was established in town, based on the collection of Mary Elizabeth Hopkins (d. 1990) and located in her former residence. It has become a noted tourist destination in the region. The historic Alley Log Cabin and Tool Museum is another unique site, dating to the 1830s.\\"Columbus Historical Preservation Trust and Museums [TX]\\" , Teaching History website, 2010-2014, accessed 19 February 2014 Demographics In 1890, 2,199 people lived in Columbus.

The population was 2,246 at the time of the 2010 census. It is commonly associated with being named after the Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon, but the town is actually named for its location on the Leon River (de Leon in Spanish), which flows directly north and east of the community, and drains into nearby Lake Proctor. History The town was laid out in April 1881 by surveying crews of the Texas Central Railway as part of the historic Missouri- Kansas-Texas (Katy Railroad) as it constructed a line from Ross just north of the Waco area, to Stamford, with the ultimate goal of extending the line to Colorado. The first city lots were auctioned on July 7, 1881, by Robert Morris Elgin, the Texas Central's land agent and for whom the town of Elgin had been named. Initially incorporated by an election held on August 30, 1890, the town government appears to have dwindled over the years, and the community was reincorporated in an election held August 29, 1899. The first mayor elected under the new incorporation was former Comanche County Judge John Lambert, who took office in April 1900. The population of De Leon remained under 1,000 until 1910, when a branch of the Texas Central line, then leased by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (Katy Railroad) was constructed from De Leon to Rising Star and Cross Plains. De Leon then became the center point for the Katy between Waco, Albany, and Cross Plains, thereby relocating numerous railroad crew members and their families to the city. The census of 1910 showed 1,015 citizens. De Leon continues to retain its rail service and the former Texas Central Katy line from Dublin to Gorman, nicknamed the \\"Peanut Line\\", is currently operated by the Fort Worth and Western Railroad. On Labor Day night 1918, oil was discovered north of De Leon just inside the Comanche County line near Desdemona. During the next two years, nearly a thousand wells were drilled in the area, and the population of De Leon rose to an estimate of more than 5,000 people. The boom was short-lived, though, and by the time the actual was census taken in 1920, the population was only 3,302. Since World War II, De Leon's population has stabilized around 2,500. Ranching dominated Comanche County until the coming of the Texas Central in 1881. Cotton soon became the primary crop, as immigrants from the southern states, and in particular the area around Oxford and Pontotoc, Mississippi, came to the De Leon vicinity starting in 1890. When the boll weevil began to make inroads in the area after 1910, farmers just west of town began to plant the small Spanish peanut. That quickly became the dominant crop, and in 1913, the De Leon Peanut Company was organized. Over time, Comanche County became the leading peanut-producing county in the U.S. Coupled with production around the neighboring community of Gorman in Eastland County, most of the peanuts went into candy, particularly Curtis Candies' Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars. Nabisco eventually purchased the De Leon Peanut Company. In the last two decades, peanut production has dropped dramatically. De Leon has one of the oldest festivals in Texas, the De Leon Peach and Melon Festival, which had its beginnings in 1914. Celebrated during the first full week in August, it draws thousands to its numerous events including a carnival, tractor pulls, car show, and a free cold watermelon slicing. The current watermelon seed-spitting distance record, as recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records, of 75 feet 2 inches, was set at the festival on August 12, 1995, by Jason Schayot, then of Georgetown, Texas. Schaynot is a descendant of two long-time De Leon families. Among De Leon's unique events is the only paid appearance by Elvis Presley in which he sang only gospel music. It occurred at Hodges Park on July 4, 1955, when he followed his friends, the Blackwood Brothers, at the Battle of Songs show. The Blackwoods had lost family members in a plane crash in Alabama the previous year, just prior to a scheduled appearance in De Leon, and had remembered them in a performance immediately preceding Elvis' performance. Elvis followed with more gospel music. It was one of three appearances Elvis made that day for promoter W.B. Nowlin, then mayor of De Leon. The other two were in Brownwood and Stephenville. Included among De Leon's most distinguished citizens are former Texas Speaker of the House and later Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes, a prot√©g√© of John B. Connally and Lyndon B. Johnson, and the 1955 Pulitzer Prize winner William White, whose The Taft Story focuses upon Republican presidential contender Robert A. Taft. Winston Lee Moore, composer and singer of \\"Don't Let the Stars Get In Your Eyes\\", was reared just north of De Leon. He is better known under his stage name, Slim Willet. Former State Representative Sid Miller was born in De Leon in 1955; he was a candidate for Texas Agriculture Commissioner in the Republican primary election scheduled for March 4, 2014. Buried in the De Leon Cemetery is Cyrus Campbell, an early resident, who as a blacksmith made the leg irons placed on Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto. According to Campbell's family tradition, his three brothers and he were the men who actually captured Lopez de Santa Anna the day following the battle. The town motto, \\"Busiest Town, Friendliest People\\", is a reminder of the slower-paced lifestyle still available in a few communities in this country.

The population was 16,002 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Texoma region. History Founded in 1850, the city of Gainesville was established on a tract of land donated by Mary E. Clark. City residents called their new community \\"Liberty\\", which proved short-lived, as a Liberty, Texas, already existed. One of the original settlers of Cooke County, Colonel William Fitzhugh, suggested that the town be named after General Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Gaines, a United States general under whom Fitzhugh had served, had been sympathetic with the Texas Revolution. The first hint of prosperity arrived with the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach in September 1858, bringing freight, passengers, and mail. In 1860, Cooke County voted against secession. In 1862, during the Civil War, the Great Hanging at Gainesville, a controversial trial and lynching of 40 suspected Union loyalists, brought the new town to the attention of the state and came close to ripping the county apart. In the decade after the Civil War, Gainesville had its first period of extended growth, catalyzed by the expansion of the cattle industry in Texas. Gainesville, only from the Oklahoma border, became a supply point for cowboys driving herds north to Kansas. The merchants of Gainesville reaped considerable benefits from the passing cattle drives. Within 20 years, the population increased from a few hundred to more than 2,000. Gainesville was incorporated on February 17, 1873, and by 1890 was established as a commercial and shipping point for area ranchers and farmers. In the late 1870s two factors drastically altered the historic landscape of North Central Texas. The first of these was barbed wire. In 1875, Henry B. Sanborn, a regional sales agent for Joseph Glidden's Bar Fence Company of DeKalb, Illinois, traveled to Texas. That autumn, he chose Gainesville as one of his initial distribution points for the newly invented barbed wire, which his employer had patented the previous year. On his first visit to Gainesville, he sold 10 reels of the wire to the Cleaves and Fletcher hardware store‚Äîthe first spools of barbed wire ever sold in Texas. World War II had an enormous impact on Cooke County. Camp Howze, an army infantry training camp, was established on some of the best farmland in the county. The construction of the camp helped bring Cooke County out of the Great Depression by providing jobs. The county population doubled and the area boomed. Since then, tourism has brought renewed prosperity to the area. The return of Amtrak on June 14, 1999, brought Gainesville back full circle to one of the original sources of its growth and success. In the early 1990s, Gainesville had 600 businesses and a population of 14,587. In 2000, the population was 15,538, with the population after the 2010 Census being just over 16,000 people. Courthouse Cooke County Courthouse Gainesville is home to a courthouse with an octagonal rotunda topped by stained glass, erected in 1910. \\"The 1912 Cooke County Courthouse was designed by the Dallas firm of Lang & Witchell. The courthouse was designed in the Beaux Arts style with some Prairie Style features and influences from famed Chicago architect Louis Sullivan. The courthouse in the center of Gainesville features black and white marbled interiors and a tall central atrium capped by a stained glass skylight under the tower.\\" The courthouse is undergoing a major renovation project, resulting in the move of many county offices to surrounding buildings. Camp Howze, World War II Gainesville was once home to Camp Howze, one of the largest infantry replacement training centers during World War II. Only a few remnants of the camp continue to exist, but are now located on private property. Railroad Railroad service across Texas changed the nature and reach of commerce when they built through and to areas. When the first railroad arrived in Gainesville, it improved the city's economics. For the first time, reliable, timely transportation meant goods and people could go vast distances. Gainesville was connected to the outside world in a whole new way with the coming of the railroads. For example, when the GC&SF; arrived in 1887, goods could directly travel to or from Gainesville, directly to Chicago and Galveston, on the same railroad. Both were and are major transportation hubs during that age, and still are today. Original companies and dates of arrival in Gainesville: *The Denison and Pacific Railway (1879) (now a part of UP via the MKT) - route: Denison, TX to Gainesville via Whitesboro, TX *Gainesville, Henrietta and Western Railway (1886) (now a part of UP via the MKT) - route: Gainesville to Wichita Falls, TX *Gulf Colorado & Santa Fe Railway (1887) (now a part of BNSF) - route: Fort Worth to OKC This turned into the following major railroads: *Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad (MKT), now the Union Pacific, but the lines owned in Gainesville were abandoned long before the UP bought the MKT in 1988. The MKT through town was abandoned around 1969 after having providing service for 90 years. *Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF), now the BNSF Railway Demographics As of the census of 2000, 15,538 people, 5,969 households, and 4,005 families resided in the city.

History In 1887, the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad constructed a line from Gainesville to Henrietta that passed through the site that would become Muenster. The town was subsequently founded in 1889 by German Catholic settlers Carl and Emil Flusche, who invited other German Catholics to join them. The town was originally to be called \\"Westphalia\\", but since the name Westphalia, Texas, was already taken, Muenster was selected instead in honor of M√ºnster, the capital of Westphalia, but these cities are not sister-cities. Many residents still spoke German in day-to-day life up until the First World War, after which the language was no longer taught in the schools and steadily declined in use. With more than 90% of the population German and Catholic, the city has preserved many German customs, and still produces traditional foods at the local meat market and B√§ckerei. An annual festival in April, Germanfest, includes beer, BBQ, German food, music, and bike and footraces. A Christkindlmarkt is held each year on Thanksgiving weekend. Catholicism was so important to the early settlers that they built a school before a church was ever established. That school, Sacred Heart Catholic School, still exists today (one of only four high schools in the Fort Worth Diocese), along with the public Muenster Independent School District.

Lee plotted a town on his land in 1872, naming it \\"Valley View\\", presumably for the view offered at the site of Spring Creek valley. Eighteen families moved in, and a post office opened in the community that same year. A blacksmith shop was opened in 1873, and the shop was used for the community's first school. By 1884 the town had an estimated 250 inhabitants, three steam gristmills and cotton gins, three general stores, and shipped cotton, livestock, and wheat. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway) reached the town in 1886.

It is the only significant town in sparsely populated Crane County and contains the only post office in the county. History While the post office dates from 1908, the discovery of oil in 1926 in the Permian Basin brought in enough fortune- seekers to populate a town. Streets are named for the children of O.C. Kinnison, the realtor who drew up the town map. By 1930, Crane was a full- fledged boomtown with churches and private businesses operating next to the more nefarious elements of frontier life. As in other oil boomtowns, development of services lagged behind temporary dwellings for the workers, although paved roads and other basic infrastructure were added following incorporation in the early 1930s. Peak population as reported by the U.S. Census was in 1960 at 3,796, and it has declined slightly since, although the town remains the center for serving the oil fields in Crane County.

The population was 507 at the 2010 Census. The town is named for its location near the New Mexico-Texas state line. The town sits on U.S Highway 87, which continues southeast towards Dalhart and northwest towards Clayton, New Mexico. History of boundary dispute For years there has been a simmering dispute over whether Texline is lawfully a part of Texas or New Mexico. The straight north-south border between the two states was originally defined as the 103rd meridian, but the 1859 survey that was supposed to mark that boundary mistakenly set the border between too far west of that line. this survey error resulted in the current towns of Farwell, Texline, and a part of Glenrio being within the State of Texas. New Mexico's short border with Oklahoma, in contrast, was correctly surveyed on the meridian. New Mexico's draft constitution in 1910 stated that the border is on the 103rd meridian as intended. The disputed strip, hundreds of miles long, includes parts of valuable oilfields of the Permian Basin. A bill was passed in the New Mexico Senate to fund and file a lawsuit in the U.S. Supreme Court to recover the strip from Texas, but the bill did not become law. Today, land in the strip is included in Texas land surveys and the land and towns for all purposes are taxed and governed by the State of Texas.

It is an inner-ring suburb of Dallas and part of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. The population was 23,728 at the 2010 census, and 25,007 at 2019's census estimates. History The area was first settled in the 1840s. Around 1879 John M. Balch and his family settled south of Mesquite in unincorporated Dallas County. Mr. Balch found several springs on his land, one of which ran year-round. Local residents began referring to the springs on Mr. Balch's property as Balch Springs, and use of the name continued even after he moved away a few years after his arrival. Around 1885, a county school was named after the springs. A small church and a cemetery were near the school. During the early 1900s, the community was widely dispersed and consisted mostly of farms. Electricity, provided by Texas Power and Light, was introduced in 1939. Gas and telephone service arrived shortly after World War II. The community began to grow rapidly along with the city of Dallas and other Dallas County towns. To avoid annexation by Dallas, Balch Springs incorporated as a city on June 13, 1953. The new city encompassed the communities of Balch Springs, Zipp City, Five Points, Jonesville, and Triangle as well as portions of Rylie and Kleberg. A mayor-council form of government was adopted after incorporation. By 1956, Balch Springs had a population of around 3,500. The city was home to 6,821 residents at the 1960 census. In September 1964, a post office opened in the city and in 1965, the first taxes were levied. A 1966 attempt to disincorporate the community was unsuccessful. By 1970, the population had risen to 10,464 as the construction of new roads made commuting to surrounding cities easier. In 1988, residents voted to become part of the neighboring city of Mesquite, but the election was declared invalid. Two years later, the 1990 census reported a total of 17,406 people living in the city. The 2000 population was 19,375. The murder of Jordan Edwards occurred in Balch Springs in 2017.

The population was 4,193 at the 2010 census. It is completely surrounded by the city of Dallas. Geography Cockrell Hill is located at (32.738731, -96.889181). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History Cockrell Hill was established by the pioneer Brentwood Allen Cockrell and his son, Woodrow. They established the town as a way of making a living, and ran it like a business. The Cockrell place was known to travelers on the stage line that ran from Dallas to Fort Belknap and on to El Paso and the west. The settlement developed as an agricultural crossroads and by the late 1800s had a few scattered homes, a small store, and a school. Water became the overriding issue for the town's continued growth. Frank Jester, a local developer, laid out the plan for the modern community of Cockrell Hill in 1911. A first attempt at incorporation in 1925 proved unsuccessful, and the following year a vote to disincorporate was approved. The second incorporation passed on July 21, 1937, when the population was 459. The town grew to a population of 1,246 in 1941.

Officer Hickey was the passenger in the patrol car, being driven by her field training officer (FTO), when they attempted to stop a vehicle for speeding and running a red light. Officer Hickey radioed dispatch to notify them of the chase but, due to an antiquated radio system, dispatch never heard the call because another officer was transmitting. Approximately three minutes later the FTO swerved to avoid another vehicle in an intersection and struck a light pole. Officer Hickey remained in serious condition before succumbing to her injuries.

History Settlement of the area began in 1845, when Illinois resident Crawford Trees purchased several thousand acres south of Camp Dallas. In 1880, the Chicago, Texas, and Mexican Central Railway reached the area and built Duncan Switch, named for a line foreman. Charles P. Nance, the community's first postmaster, renamed the settlement Duncanville in 1882. By the late 19th century, Duncanville was home to a dry-goods stores, a pharmacy, a domino parlor, and a school. Between 1904 and 1933, the population of Duncanville increased from 113 to more than 300. During World War II, the Army Air Corps established a landing field for flight training on property near the present-day intersection of Main St and Wheatland Road. Duncanville residents incorporated the city on August 2, 1947.

Water tower in the Fairmeadows neighborhood of Duncanville, depicting the city slogan Water towers on the southern edge of Duncanville, northern edge of Cedar Hill Water tower on east side of Clark Road Historic preservation The Texas Historical Commission has designated the City of Duncanville as an official Main Street City. Duncanville recognizes the importance of the former Duncanville Air Force Station, which closed on July 1, 1964, but the Army continued to operate the Nike Missile air defense operations until 1969, when the facility was turned over to the city. The WWII-era barracks and some other structures were initially repurposed for civic and community use. Over time, the buildings were systematically demolished, removing all signs of the historic base, but the history of the facility lives on in a monument that stands outside the library and community center. The \\"stone igloo\\", a spring house originally located near the intersection of Center Street and Cedar Ridge Road, was preserved in a unique way. In the late 1960s or early 1970s, it was demolished, thereby producing a supply of rocks used to build a replica of the structure at a nearby park and paving the way for the construction of a neighborhood retail center. Various pieces of the city's history are preserved at the Duncanville Historical Park, which is located on Wheatland Road in Armstrong Park on land that was once a part of the Duncanville Air Force Station.

The population was 8,564 at the 2010 census. It is located between the Dallas North Tollway and U.S. Route 75 (North Central Expressway), north of downtown Dallas. Highland Park is bordered on the south, east and west by Dallas and on the north by the city of University Park. Highland Park and University Park together comprise the Park Cities, an enclave of Dallas. Highland Park is the most affluent city in Texas and is ranked the 7th richest place in the United States. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/bloomberg-richest- places-in-america.html Addresses in Highland Park may use either \\"Dallas, Texas\\" or \\"Highland Park, Texas\\" as the city designation, although the United States Postal Service prefers the use of the \\"Dallas, Texas\\" designation for the sake of simplicity. The same is true for mail sent to University Park. History Exall Lake, Dallas, Texas (postcard, circa 1901‚Äì1907) The land now known as Highland Park was bought in 1889 by a group of investors from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, known as the Philadelphia Place Land Association, for an average price of $377 an acre, with a total of $500,000. Henry Exall, an agent, intended to develop the land along Turtle Creek as Philadelphia Place, exclusive housing based on parkland areas in Philadelphia. He laid gravel roads, and dammed Turtle Creek, forming Exall Lake, before the Panic of 1893 brought a blow to his fortunes, halting development. Afterwards, he began a horse breeding farm. In the 1890s, Exall Lake was a common picnic destination for Dallas residents. In 1906, John S. Armstrong (the former partner of Thomas Marsalis, the developer of Oak Cliff), sold his meatpacking business and invested his money in a portion of the former Philadelphia Place land, to develop it under the name of Highland Park. He chose this name as it was located on high land that overlooked downtown Dallas. Wilbur David Cook, the landscape designer who had planned Beverly Hills, California, and George E. Kessler, who had previously planned Fair Park and most of downtown Dallas, were hired to design its layout in 1907. Notably, twenty percent of the original land was set aside for parks. A second development in Highland Park was developed in 1910. In 1913, Highland Park petitioned Dallas for annexation, but was refused. The 500 residents voted to incorporate on November 29, 1913, and incorporation was granted in 1915, when its population was 1,100. The first mayor of Highland Park was W. A. Fraser. A third and fourth development were added to the town in 1915 and 1917, respectively. In 1919, the city of Dallas sought to annex Highland Park, beginning a lengthy controversy that lasted until 1945. J. W. Bartholow led the fight to resist the annexation. The final major land development occurred in 1924. In 1931, Highland Park Village was constructed, the first shopping center of its kind in the United States. The distinctive Moorish Style ornamental metalwork and lighting in Highland Park Village were created by Potter Art Metal Studios, a 90-year-old custom metalwork company still in existence today. Because of its location near Dallas, Highland Park had, by the early 1930s, developed a moderately large (8,400) population, with a few businesses. Eventually the school districts and newspapers of Highland Park and University Park were combined. In the 1940s, after the failure to annex Highland Park, Dallas began annexing the land surrounding it. Reaching a population high of just under 13,000 in the late 1950s, Highland Park afterwards grew only by building houses on the remaining vacant lots, and by the destruction of old buildings. Since 1990, Highland Park has maintained strict zoning ordinances. Known for its quality housing, the town still has many parks running along Turtle Creek and is home to the Dallas Country Club. Highland Park became somewhat famous in the early 1980s when the popular television show Dallas used to shoot on location there. The 2012 TV series GCB took place in the fictitious \\"Hillside Park\\", which is likely a stand-in for Highland Park; however, the residence in the show where the mother of the main character, \\"Amanda Vaughn\\", lived is actually located in East Dallas. From the Netflix original show, House of Cards, main character Claire Underwood (played by Robin Wright) grew up in Highland Park.

It is the easternmost city completely within Dallas County. The population was 5,130 at the 2010 census.United States Census History The town now called Sunnyvale was inhabited by various Native American tribes in the years before the European conquest of the Americas. It became under the rule of Spain in the 18th century, very close to the boundary of Spanish and French territory (although this boundary was carried upward a bit in 1819; see Adams-On√≠s Treaty.) During this time, the area was relatively underdeveloped. However, some settlers migrated to Texas and would eventually settle in Sunnyvale. In 1821, the town became a possession of Mexico when Mexico received its independence from Spain. After the Texas Revolution, the area once again changed hands, under the Republic of Texas. This is when the town started to develop. During this time, settlers migrated to present-day Sunnyvale, naming the hamlet they founded Long Creek.1. In 1845 Texas became a United States state. More settlers migrated to the area. In the 1860s, the town was briefly part of the Confederate States of America. As more people arrived, eventually three new towns sprang up in the area: New Hope, Tripp, and Hatterville. New Hope was the most prosperous of these. It had many shops and stores, a fair called Gala Days, and a newspaper, the New Hope News. It was neighboring Mesquite's biggest rival. This all ended in 1921, when a storm blew the town away 2. Many buildings were damaged and the prosperous days were over. From this year on to the 1950s, the four towns had no new developments, remaining stagnant. In the year 1953, the hamlets of Hatterville, New Hope, Long Creek, and Tripp merged under the name Sunnyvale. The name was chosen in a contest from a local school. Today, there are many reminders of Sunnyvale's rich history, like the old New Hope School; the Tripp First Baptist Church, built in 1882; and many antique houses. The Long Creek Cemetery in southern Sunnyvale is over 150 years old, and the first recorded burial there is that of Leona Crownover Caldwell, dated October 2, 1855. There are also veterans from most major American wars, including the War of 1812, the Civil War (both Union and Confederate veterans), the World Wars, and others. Some of the oldest burials in the cemetery include James Truss and Priscilla Dulaney Truss, both born in 1799 2. In March 2012, Sunnyvale, Texas was named the whitest town in North Texas by D Magazine, and the power of that article was something that is still brought up today. The reason that Sunnyvale was named the whitest town in North Texas was based on an initial, U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyern study that deducted that out of 2,228 residents in Sunnyvale, TX, that only 16 of them were African American. On December 26, 2015 the town was struck by an EF-4 tornado causing extensive damage to the Plantation RV park, the tornado then grew and moved northeast into Garland and Rowlett killing 12 people and injuring many.

In 2000 a U.S. district court ruled that Sunnyvale had enacted planning and zoning practices that were in place to exclude the development of apartments and small single family lots. Sunnyvale and the Inclusive Communities Project (ICP) entered into an agreement in which Sunnyvale was given three years to identify 70 housing units favorable for purchase or rent by low income individuals and families. Since 2008, three developers have considered low income developments in Sunnyvale, but no applications have been filed with the Town. ICP filed a lawsuit against Sunnyvale in 2009, seeking the development of low income units at a site in Sunnyvale. Sunnyvale's government responded, saying that it had taken appropriate steps to approve the creation of low income housing.

The population was 23,068 at the 2010 census. The city is home to Southern Methodist University. University Park is bordered on the north, east and west by Dallas and on the south by the town of Highland Park. University Park and Highland Park together comprise the Park Cities, an enclave of Dallas. University Park is one of the most affluent places in Texas based on per capita income; it is ranked #12. In 2018, data from the American Community Survey revealed that University Park was the 2nd wealthiest city in the United States - with a median household income of $198,438 and a poverty rate of 4.2%. Addresses in University Park may use either \\"Dallas, Texas\\" or \\"University Park, Texas\\" as the city designation, although the United States Postal Service prefers the use of the \\"Dallas, Texas\\" designation for the sake of simplicity.http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/zcl_3_results.jsp The same is true for mail sent to Highland Park. History Highland Park Presbyterian Church (HPPC) in University Park University Park began as a cluster of homes surrounding the fledgling Southern Methodist University, which was founded in the then-rural Dallas County in 1915. The university supplied these homes with utility service until 1924, when the growing population could no longer be supported by the school's utilities. In response, the area's homeowners first sought annexation into the town of Highland Park, but were refused due to the high cost that would have been required to provide the necessary utility and safety services. Shortly thereafter, Dallas also refused a request for annexation on similar grounds. Community leaders organized to incorporate as a separate individual city. According to state law, incorporation required that area residents hold an election on the issue before the new city could be officially formed and recognized. On April 24, 1924, voters approved the measure by a 5:1 margin. Operating under the commission form of government, the city began the work of shaping the new government and addressing the pressing need to establish basic municipal services. To provide for the financial needs of the city, another election was held soon thereafter to authorize the issuance of municipal bonds. Passing by a near unanimous margin, the $150,000 bond issue funded the installation of a new water supply system, street paving, and the construction of a new city hall and fire station. When first incorporated, the city encompassed , 380 homes, and 1200 residents. As a result of efforts to build and improve the city, University Park grew to a population of over 20,000 residents by 1945 and had become one of the most prestigious locations in the area. In fact, the community's attractiveness and tax value had risen to such an extent that the city of Dallas now wanted to annex University Park into its boundaries. At the time of the election, even the Board of Commissioners favored the election. In the largest voter turnout to that date and still one of the largest in city history, the annexation was denied by a 53% to 47% margin. In 1946 an election to adopt a Home Rule Charter was held, but the measure failed and the city continued to operate as a General Law city. In 1989 voters approved a Home Rule Charter which officially adopted a council-manager form of government and expanded the three member board of Commissioners into a five-member city council. Since the 1940s, the population and area of University Park has stabilized at 24,000 residents and 2,350 acres (4.7 square miles). The city is now surrounded by Dallas on three sides and the town of Highland Park to the south. Originally University Park was a middle class community.Gray, A.W. Poisoned Dreams: A True Story of Murder, Money, and Family Secrets. AudioGO, September 15, 2014. , 9781482101874. Google Books PT138.

History Los Ybanez was organized in the late 1970s (formally incorporated in 1983) as one of several Texas municipalities that were organized in order to legalize local sale of alcoholic spirits. These were usually small areas of land, adjacent to larger towns or cities. Others included \\"Impact\\" near Abilene, TX and \\"Orbit\\" near Monahans, TX. Texas law provides that all its 254 counties are essentially \\"dry\\"; that is, liquor sales are not allowed. Local governments can opt for these sales through \\"local option\\" elections. The western half of Texas is generally and historically dry, though as the metro areas grew, most allow liquor in clubs, some on sale in stores. Los Ybanez was founded by members of the family of Israel G. and Mary Ybanez. Ybanez purchased a tract of land outside all towns from the state of Texas (which had obtained title from the federal government after World War II.) The land had been used for soldiers' barracks during military training exercises at an adjoining glider base. Family members were moved to the land to occupy the houses and establish residency. Later they incorporated as a town, got a US Post Office, and legalized liquor sales. The store operates to this day as a drive through only operation, accepting only cash. The Ybanez family also founded a local radio station, KYMI (now KJJT) as a vehicle for advertising for the liquor store business. KYMI began on 107.9 MHz, but moved to 98.5 in 1996 when a station in Odessa upgraded facilities. KYMI received money for a new transmitter and antenna in return for agreeing to change channels.Federal Communications Commission decision regarding change in channels http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Orders/1995_Orders/da950395.txt .

Located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River, Cooper is the largest settlement in Delta County. As of the U.S. Census of 2010, Cooper had a population of 1,969. First inhabited by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, at the same time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agriculture and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's cotton crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began to shift to wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has been on a slow decline since the 1970s. Cooper currently has no sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city's economy still relies largely on agriculture. Cooper is located on the eastern edge of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex (DFW metroplex), a large, 12-county metropolitan area, one of the most populated in the country. History=Before establishment The first inhabitants of the area that is now the site of Cooper were the Caddo Indians, who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 AD. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers. The first European to visit the area was French explorer Fran√ßois Hervey, who discovered the area around 1750. However, a few decades later, some of the Indians caught European diseases and along with attacks from neighboring Indian tribes, forced the Caddo out of the area around Cooper. Around 1820, Delaware, Quapaw, and Seminole tribes settled in the area. In 1836, the Republic of Texas officially recognized the region around Cooper as part of Red River County. In 1840, Lamar County was formed, absorbing the Cooper area. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed Hopkins County. After the Civil War, the region around the site of Cooper began to grow and develop. People in nearby Ben Franklin, Texas, grew tired of the poor road conditions that connected the region. In 1868, people in the area petitioned the state government to create a new county located between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River. On July 29, 1870, after two years of debating, the state of Texas granted the request for the new county. Shortly afterwards, the first settlements were built in Cooper and the town was established. The community was named after Leroy Cooper, the chairman of the Texas House Committee on Counties and Boundaries, who helped establish the new county. Cooper was selected as the seat for the county, which was named Delta County due to its triangular shape. Since establishment Cooper grew rapidly after being established, with a post office built in the community in 1871. Cooper was incorporated into a town in 1881 and held its first government elections. That same year, Cooper constructed the county courthouse. The town became the main market center for Delta County, and by 1885, Cooper had a population around 300. The Texas Midland Railroad, which ran through Cooper, was chartered in 1892. The railroad helped promote the rapid growth of the town. By 1896, Cooper's population had passed 1,000 people, and contained two churches, a school, and 21 businesses, including a bank and a hotel. The town also had two weekly newspapers. Cooper continued to grow into the early 1900s, especially in the area of agriculture. From the early 1890s to around 1910, farms boomed both in number and in value, with the number of cash crops nearly tripling. The region produced over 70,000 chickens and almost 7,000 pigs yearly. Cooper continued to grow into the 1920s. The bank had been rebuilt in 1909, and the region's crops continued to prosper. Cooper reported its largest population, 2,563, in 1925. Delta County was hit by the Great Depression early, though. In late 1926, the community's cotton crop failed, forcing many residents to withdraw their savings. The bank was forced to close in 1927, and by the time it reopened a few months later, the region's economy had plummeted. Several families moved away from Cooper during the early 1930s, and in 1933, the bank was forced to close again. The Midland Texas Railroad failed, hurting Cooper's economy further. The New Deal program offered government-financed construction projects in Cooper, and in 1940, the Works Progress Administration demolished the former courthouse in Cooper and replaced it with a new one at a cost of $110,450 (equivalent to $ respectively in ). However, even with the stability of the economy, Cooper's population remained low until the 1950s, when it returned to about 2,350 people. The population declined again in the 1980s, and has continued to slowly decline. Cooper had roughly 60 businesses in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1986, work on Cooper Lake had begun. Filling of the lake began in September 1991, and by the next year, the lake was open for recreation. At that time, Cooper reported having 70 businesses, and a population around 2,200. By 2000, the population had dropped by about 50 people and an estimate for 2016 is 1957 inhabitants. Geography Cooper is the county seat of Delta County, as well as its most populated city. According to statistics from the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which (99.31%) is land. About (0.69%) is covered by water. Cooper is located at an elevation of , a few miles north of Cooper Lake, between the north and south forks of the Sulphur River. It is located about northeast of Dallas and west of Texarkana. Texas State Highway 24 bypasses Cooper to the north; however, Texas State Highway 24 Business splits off and passes through the center of the city. Texas State Highway 154 begins at the western edge of Cooper and passes through the center of the city, intersecting Farm to Market Road 1528 near the county courthouse. Farm to Market Road 64 enters the very western portion of Cooper before terminating at State Highway 24. Nearby highways include Farm to Market Road 1880 and Farm to Market Road 1529. Cooper, as well as most of Delta County, is located in the Texas Blackland Prairies region, a flat, tall-grass prairie ecosystem that covers a large portion of north-central Texas. The region's elevation rarely differs from around . The area's geology consists mainly of deep clay, or clay mixed with a dark-colored loam. However, the county is also known to have high-quality topsoil, ideal for crop growing.

By 1860, two Methodist Episcopal churches had been built nearby. In 1880, seven churches, which were predominantly Methodist, had been established in Delta County. In 1889, seven Baptist churches that had been established in the region held a meeting as the Delta County Baptist Association. During the early 1980s, 17 churches were in Delta County, two of which were located in Cooper. In 1931, 13 Baptist churches were located in and around Cooper. During the mid-1960s, 32 churches were in the region, representing seven Christian denominations. However, by 1982, five of those churches had closed. Currently, 18 churches are located within the city limits of Cooper. These include congregations of the United Methodist Church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, as well as those of Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal, Methodist Episcopal, and other denominations of Christianity. Six of the churches are of Baptist denomination, and three are Methodist. Economy Businesses on Cooper's town square, December 2012 Cooper's economy relied heavily on agriculture from its founding until the 1950s, especially on the growing of cash crops. In 1880, cotton, corn, sorghum, and other crops were grown on over of farmland. The county also produced large quantities of livestock, with almost 3,000 cattle and 10,000 hogs grazing on land near Cooper. The logging industry began to grow in the region, and several mills were constructed, producing furniture and lumber. In 1886, the Santa Fe Railway built a line through the county, and the shipping of crops and lumber became a major business in Cooper. During the early 1890s, the livestock industry in Delta County struggled, with the number of hogs being raised dropping to half of what it had been the previous decade. However, the agricultural business boomed, with the number of farms in the area around Cooper increasing to 1,188, and the value of the farms doubled to $1,400 (equivalent to $, respectively in ) each. The production of cotton tripled, and the poultry industry began to boom. Within the city limits, Cooper housed a hotel, a shoemaker, a grocery store, a wagon maker, feed stores, general stores, drug stores, and several cotton and oat gins. Delta County contained 18 manufacturing establishments, but they only employed 33 people. The average income for someone working in the region was $208 (equivalent to $ respectively in ). At the turn of the century, the cotton industry was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially chicken. In addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become an important part of the economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses. Currently, Cooper's economy features several unique industries. According to the 2010 Census, the industries in the town (by percentage of employed civilian population 16 years and over) were educational, health, and social services at 34.6%, manufacturing at 18.7%, arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services with 13.6%, construction at 10.2%, transportation, warehousing, and utilities at 5.1%, professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services at 4.9%, public administration with 4.3%, retail trade at 3.9%, finance, insurance, real estate, and rental and leasing with 2.0%, other services (except public administration) with 1.6%, and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining at 1.0%. Of the people in the labor force over the age of 16, 679 people (49.3% of the population) were in the civilian work force, while 697 people (50.7% of the population) were not in the labor force at all. At the time of the Census, 70 people (5.1%) were unemployed, with none in the armed forces. Of the 609 employed residents over the age 16, private- sector wage and salary workers accounted for 475 of them (78.0%).

Arts and culture alt=A swimming area on a lake Chiggerfest in 2015 Since its founding, Cooper has served as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several small schools and churches. In 1955, the construction of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds, and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On the eastern edge of the lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license. Cooper is also host to the annual Chiggerfest. The event, held every October, serves as a social gathering for the region. The two-day event begins with an open-air concert in Historic Cooper Square. Other events include a 5K run/walk and smashing a car. The festival includes numerous street vendors and a children's area. Patterson Memorial County Library is also located in Cooper, as well as a municipal park, and numerous recreational and community centers, including the historic McKinney Home, the house of Dr. John and May McKinney, which was built in 1912 and later restored by their decedent author Susan Albright Hyde.http://ketr.org/post/coopers-dollhouse-turns-100 Government Since its incorporation in 1870, Cooper has served as the seat for Delta County. Because of this, Cooper houses the county courthouse, county offices, sheriff, and county library. Cooper has a mayor‚Äìcouncil government.

Delta County, in addition to Cooper, voted for the Democratic Party in every presidential election from its incorporation in 1870 until 1968. However, the Populist Party won numerous local and county government positions during the 1890s and the early 1900s. In the 1970s, politics in Delta County shifted, and most of the county began voting for the Republican Party. Delta County's government consists of a county judge and four county commissioners, representing four county precincts. The current Delta County judge is Herbert Brookshire, and the four commissioners are B. V. Templeton, David Moody, Wayne Poole, and Mark Brantley. The current county sheriff is Gerald W. Teague. In addition, Cooper is served by two Texas judicial districts. Judge Scott McDowell serves as judge of the 62nd Texas Judicial District, a position he has held since 2000. However, McDowell has announced that he will not be seeking another term. Cooper is also part of Texas' 8th Judicial District, which is served by Judge Robert Newsom. Newsom has served as 8th district judge since his election in 1997, but has also announced that he will not be seeking another term. Cooper is represented by Reggie Smith (Republican) in the Texas State Legislature's 62nd District. Senator Bob Hall (Republican) represents Cooper in the Texas State Senate's 2nd District.

Education East Texas Normal College (now known as alt=A college building in 1890 Delta County has historically been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, nine churches were already in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. A combined 998 students attended those schools, which operated 4¬Ω months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The school did very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce. In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper. Schools were important during the 1940s, as they became the local activity centers. In the early 1940s, there were 34 common schools and six independent school districts within Delta County. These schools employed 134 people and had a combined total of 4,000 students enrolled. Cooper, along with Pecan Gap and Enloe, offered a four-year high school program. Late in the 1940s, with the help of state taxes on transportation, the schools and districts began to consolidate. In 1966, Cooper had two elementary schools, a junior high school, and a high school. The Cooper Independent School District (Cooper ISD) currently operates the schools that serve Cooper. Cooper ISD covers the majority of Delta County, except for the community of Lake Creek, which is located within the jurisdiction of Chisum ISD, and the communities of Pecan Gap and Ben Franklin, which are located within Fannindel ISD. There are currently only three schools under the jurisdiction of Cooper ISD, all three of with are located within Cooper proper. The schools are Cooper Elementary School, Cooper Junior High School, and Cooper High School. Media The first newspaper published in Cooper was the Delta Courier in 1873. The newspaper, published by Bob Michiel, ran weekly until the mid-1890s. Around the time the publishing of the Delta Courier ended, the People's Cause newspaper began running weekly. This eventually stopped running; however, The Cooper Review began running weekly in 1982. The Cooper Review, run by Jim and Sally Butler, is still published.

It is a suburb of Fort Worth. History The first European settlement, consisting of a few families, occurred in the Argyle area in the 1850s. The place was then known as Pilot Knob or Waintown. The settlement gradually acquired a few amenities in the late 1800s: a school in 1875, a Baptist church in 1876, and a post office in 1878. The community was formally founded and renamed Argyle in 1881, after the Texas and Pacific railroad built a track through the area. Some believe a railroad surveyor named the town after a garden in France. However, others believe the town to be named after the region of Argyll in Scotland. Also around this time was when Sam Bass, an infamous outlaw who stole $60,000 in gold coins from the Union Pacific Railroad, was rumored to have stashed the gold in a cave. Sam Bass died when he was 27, and it was rumored he never lived to retrieve the gold. Growth was very slow during the nineteenth century, and by 1890 Argyle only had a population of 148. The town did boast several agriculture-related industries, such as grist mills, general stores, and a cotton gin. In 1885 Argyle built a two-story brick school, and population grew until it reached 238 in 1930. A bank was also established in 1906, a little red brick building with a drugstore in the front. The bank wasn't around long before it was robbed in 1912. The robbers made away with $1700 and were never caught. Electricity and telephone service became available in the mid-1930s. The Great Depression took its toll on the Argyle area, and the population declined to only ninety in 1950. Argyle incorporated as a separate city on September 19, 1960, with M.H. Wilson as the first mayor. Gradually the town grew in population as more people from the Dallas-Fort Worth area discovered its rural charm. By the 1970s a number of retail establishments were located in Argyle, and the population reached 1,575 in 1990, and doubled from that figure to 3,282 at the 2010 census. The high rate of growth is expected to continue as part of the general development of northern areas in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. Geography Argyle is located at (33.116422, -97.185461).

Edwards eventually gave each of his 10 children a lot on which to build a home. The Edwards family was instrumental in several civil developments. Dancing was not allowed, but the townspeople often gathered in the Edwards home for singing and listening music performed on an organ that Edwards had imported. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway completed a track and station in Aubrey and commenced operations.Former Teacher Remembers When Aubrey Was Founded, Denton Record-Chronicle, pg. 2, sec 4, July 28, 1963 In 1885, Edwards offered a lot to each congregation that would build a church within a year.

The population was 1,469 at the 2010 census. History Bartonville was originally part of the Chinn's Chapel settlement, but then it decided to change to a place that was established in 1853 by Elisha Chinn. Chinn's Chapel eventually became three small communities, with Bartonville being the lone remaining town. Bartonville was settled in 1878 and was named for T. Bent Barton. In 1886 a local post office was established, and by 1890 Bartonville had 25 residents, a general store, a gristmill, and a cotton gin, all owned by the Barton family. By 1896 Bartonville's population was estimated at 100 and the town had three general stores. The post office was discontinued in 1906. Slow growth continued, and by 1930 Bartonville had a population of 300 and a business establishment. In 1960, with cities such as Irving looking to expand northward, local residents feared annexation and Bartonville incorporated for the first time. The town then included Double Oak and Copper Canyon, as well as present-day Bartonville. Once the fear of annexation subsided a few years later, Bartonville citizens voted for disincorporation. The present town of Bartonville was incorporated in 1973, and the town has continued to grow as part of the general development of the area north of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.

Copper Canyon was founded in April 1973. Irving, Texas was the first to have their eyes set on annexing the land of what is now Copper Canyon. When the Town of Flower Mound threatened to annex the ranches and rural homesteads, residents, Bob \\"Shack\\" Shackelford, Fielding \\"Dutch\\" Schulz, and Paul Vickery were the first to recognize this threat to their simple rural living. These men convinced Bill Ferris, Bob Woodin, Tom Murray and Bob Allen to incorporate the town in an effort to preserve the rural atmosphere and freedom of the community. With the threats of the expansive ranch land being annexed into today's Flower Mound, Texas and facing increasing taxes and regulations, the founding fathers knew it was time to act. Meetings began to take place at the home of Bob and Jean Shackelford. The first mayor was Robert Woodin. The first marshal was Bob Shackelford. Council meetings were held in homes until 1978, when Bob Shackelford and Bill Ferris began planning an official town hall be constructed. Many residents chipped in materials and hard work to build the town hall, designed by Bob Shackelford and nicknamed \\"Moonshiner's Shack\\", his design reflected the traditional ranch house, and was constructed at 400 Woodland Drive. The developer of the Woodlands Addition donated the land. Bob Shackelford had a plaque made naming and honoring all the men and women who gave unselfishly both their time and devotion to creating Copper Canyon, Texas. This plaque hangs on the wall of the current town hall. The population was 1,334 at the 2010 census. Copper Canyon is adjacent to the master-planned Lantana residential development. History The first white settlement in the area that would become Copper Canyon occurred in the 1840s. One of the more prominent settler families was that of Elisha and Mary Chinn, who came to Texas from their original home in North Carolina in 1852. They helped establish the first church in the area, a log-cabin chapel which eventually became known as the Chinn's Chapel Methodist Church. The church is still active on what is now known as Chinn Chapel Road. The town gradually grew with cattle ranching as the mainstay of the local economy. The railroad came to the area in 1881, and the first public school was constructed in 1884. The town apparently got its name from \\"Copperhead Canyon,\\" a part of the area formerly known for venomous snakes. Population, never large, generally stagnated or declined in the first half of the twentieth century. After World War II the area's rural charm slowly began to attract residents from the more crowded parts of the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. The town was formally incorporated in 1973. Although still rather sparsely populated, the town has grown as part of the general development of areas north of the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Census Bureau figures tell the story: 465 (1980), 978 (1990), 1,216 (2000), 1,334 (2010). Traditional ranches are still found in the area, but Copper Canyon has become primarily a bedroom community with little commercial development.

Not sure if same entity. The land was donated by the Blackland Townsite Company, a subsidiary of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. Historically, the town center was based near the intersection of two railroads, near present-day East Hebron Parkway and 1st Street. Much of that town center has been cleared and developed. The town was first incorporated in 1961 as a method to prevent Plano and Carrollton from annexing the territory and imposing taxes. The city of Hebron imposed no taxes of its own, and when the time was ripe for a landowner to develop his land, he would ask the town to disannex that parcel. Hebron's city limits once covered about from the Collin County line west to the Trinity and from the Dallas County line north to State Highway 121. Now it comprises a few plots of land connected with narrow strips and easements, which confuses many maps. Stanley Dozier, the namesake of Dozier Road, was the only mayor of the town between 1961 and 1997. The town is currently managed by a three-person commission with Kelly Clem as the current mayor. Air Park-Dallas Airport was built as a public civilian airstrip within the city limits in 1965. For the last 20 years, Hebron has deannexed large portions of its territory to neighboring communities (Lewisville, The Colony, Carrollton, and Plano), to be annexed by those communities instead. The original goal was for Hebron to disappear entirely as an incorporated community, but recently elected leaders have attempted to reverse the situation and allow Hebron to continue as a town. This is partially in response to the city of Carrollton's threatening not to maintain the water supply unless the town is annexed to Carrollton.\\"Hebron near its breaking point.\\" The Dallas Morning News.

History Krum is on Farm Road 1173 northwest of Denton in west- central Denton County. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway ran a line through western Denton County in 1884. In the fall of 1886, Mr. L.L. Finley sold off the south end of his farm to the railroad for a town site. With this began the building of a business community in Krum. The company bought , platted a townsite, and named the community for one of its employees, Charles K. Krum shown as a railroad official. Mr. Finley opened a general merchandise store in the new town on the lot now owned by the Harpool Seed Company. The Santa Fe moved in a boxcar to serve as a depot. By 1887, the depot and section house were completed and the railway had built the first house in Krum for the home of their agent. It was built east of the railroad on the site later known as Knight's Bee and Chicken Farm. The Post Office came in 1888 and was first housed in the Finley Store with Mr. Finley handling the mail. By 1888, R.R. Turner had started a blacksmith shop on the south side of the main street and Amos Rowley had a saloon on the north side. R.C. Scripture sold hardware, harness, clothing, and other merchandise from a large store where the bank now stands. In 1891, Dr. W.G. Kimbrough opened a drugstore and began the practice of medicine. Arthur Jackson set up a lumber yard where one continued to be opened until recent years. The office faced the main street on the south. John Boyd opened a barbershop next door on the east. The one-room schoolhouse was moved from North Hickory Creek in 1891 and placed on the ground where the present high school stands. The Methodist congregation continued to use it as their meeting house. The Literary and Debating Society was organized and met in the school. All of the young people in the area joined. In that year also, the second house was built in Krum for a young bachelor, W.H. Henshel. In 1894, Reuben (\\"Pony\\") McGee opened a hardware and feed store on the south side of the business street, next door to the lumberyard office, on the west. He built the third house in Krum for his family. Mr. McGee performed a public service by providing a watering trough for farmers' teams at a well behind his store. Dr. W.H. Kimbrough's sons, Walter and Wallace, completed their medical education at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, and joined their father in Krum. By 1899, the telephone and telegraph had arrived. The Baptist congregation had moved their church building from North Hickory Creek into town, and the members of the Church of Christ built their meetinghouse that year. In addition to other businesses already established, June Benton had a livery stable that covered all the lots from the present Muncy Building to the washateria, and was busy renting buggies and teams. Frank Shifflett and Brent Jackson owned a wagon yard adjoining the livery stable on the north. There was a cotton gin, a restaurant, short-order house, and a dry-line delivering freight. W.T. Ginn had built a hotel earlier in the 1890s. It was later owned by the Butterworths for many years, then by the Chitwoods, and finally by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Ericson. The roomy old house was recently torn down and the lots sold. In 1898, S.D. Chadwell built a fine hotel on three lots, which is now a brick building occupied by Kountry Store, Krum Korral, and Fowler Hardware. The hotel was a one-story wooden structure surround by a white picket fence. Facing the alley in back were stables, a cow shed, coalhouse, and other necessary out-door facilities. Inside, the floors were covered with an elegant turkey-red carpet, which was the talk of the countryside. There were rooms for \\"drummers\\" to display their merchandise and merchants came from miles around to buy. Unfortunately, this asset to the community was destroyed by fire and was not rebuilt. The site would eventually be taken up by a brick building constructed in 1976 and occupied by Kountry Store, Krum Korral and Fowler Hardware. The community reported a population of seventy-five in 1892, and by 1900 it was thriving, with a number of businesses, four churches, and a school. Also in 1900 the railroad shipped at least half a million bushels of wheat, prompting the claim that Krum was the \\"largest inland grain market in the world.\\" In 1905 the Flour Mill and Elevator Company and three other elevator companies were operating at the community. The mill burned in 1915, and changing storage and marketing practices eventually closed the remaining elevators. Krum's growth and prosperity continued until about 1925, when its population reached 750. The community declined as cars and trucks began carrying trade to larger markets and as young people departed for college or city jobs. With the Great Depression years, the town's population level dropped below 300, then stayed low in the post-World War II period, ranging between 300 and 400 until the 1970s, when the sprawl of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area northward brought suburban homeseekers in increasing numbers. Access from Krum to Interstate Highway 35 made commuting to city jobs convenient, and the community's population rose to 605 by 1978, to 917 by 1982, and to 1,542 by 1990. In 2000 the population was 1,979. Notable residents The Quebe Sisters Band violin and vocal stars, Grace, Sophia and Hulda Quebe, grew up in Krum. They tour nationally and have performed at the Grand Ole Opry. The band is now based in Fort Worth.

History  Lincoln Park is one of several towns that incorporated in Denton County in the early 1970s to sell alcohol in this otherwise dry county. Incorporated in 1971, Lincoln Park served the Denton to McKinney corridor of U.S. Highway 380, supplying both college students from Denton and travelers passing through with drinks. After both Denton and McKinney voted to allow alcoholic sales in their cities, Lincoln Park began to decline. Previously it consisted of the original mobile home park, a liquor store and a Trail Dust Steak House restaurant. Due to the land being sold for redevelopment to Centurion American Development, on March 29, 2015 the Trail Dust Steakhouse closed permanently and has been leveled. Also on the same day residents of Lincoln Park were notified that the land was also sold for redevelopment with all residents having to leave or relocate their homes before the end of June. The mobile home park has since been vacated. Little Elm struck a deal with an arm of Centurion American Development, a mega-developer that has built everything from high-rises to master-planned, vastly upscale residential enclaves. In 2014, Centurion made a deal with Nathaniel Parker III, father of Tan Parker (Texas House of Representatives) to purchase the acreage in and around Lincoln Park, one of the state's fastest growing areas. Little Elm then annexed Lincoln Park in an acrimonious and legally disputed maneuver in April.http://watchdog.org/223660/developer-hands-cash-fbi-investigates-rural- texas-village/ Education Lincoln Park is served by the Denton Independent School District.

History  Original residents began moving into the small area in the late 1960s, attracted to inexpensive country living. The town had no formal government until it was incorporated in 1983 to prevent possible annexation by neighboring cities which would bring higher tax rates and more strict regulations. The town took the name of a nearby park operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Originally designed as an affordable location to purchase land for manufactured (or mobile) homes, the area has few site-built structures. In late November 2007, Marshall Creek consolidated with neighboring Roanoke, Texas.Roanoke votes for town to absorb Marshall Creek, 2007-11-08. Retrieved 2010-01-30.  Politics  Incorporated as a general law municipality in 1983, Marshall Creek remained, by virtue of its small borders, relatively out of the public spotlight. However, internal strife caused the town to become unstable. According to published reports, bookkeeping by the government was spotty, resulting in losses from unpaid property taxes the town failed to assess. In 1996, the government fell behind in payments to the Trinity River Authority, which removed and treated sewage for the town. After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the small town, with its equivalently small police force, lost a sizable contract to patrol nearby Marshall Creek Park. Instead, the Army Corps of Engineers awarded that contract to nearby Trophy Club, which had a larger and more experienced force. In addition, in 2002, police officers who had written traffic tickets for the city on nearby US Highway 377 were revealed to have expired peace officer certifications, thus rendering those citations invalid. The town was forced to repay approximately US$4,300 in traffic fines. As a result of the loss of income from the Corps of Engineers contract as well as poor records management and having virtually no other revenue source than property taxes and traffic citations, the town filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code in January 2006. The town's last mayor prior to consolidation was James Macy-Simpson.  Consolidation  As part of the May 12, 2007, general election, Marshall Creek voters were asked if they wished to consolidate with the nearby town of Roanoke. This proposition was approved by a vote of 72‚Äì18. Roanoke voters decided on November 6, 2007 to consolidate Marshall Creek into Roanoke by an 83% margin of victory. Roanoke canvassed the election on November 19, 2007 and the consolidation became official. Geography Marshall Creek was located at (33.017727, -97.208625).

Historical events Farmers and Merchants Bank building, located at the northwest corner of the town square in Pilot Point, Texas Pilot Point was platted on Christmas Day in 1853. G.W. Newcome was the surveyor, from Kentucky Town, Grayson County, Texas. The streets were laid out and lots were sold. One of the first buildings in the newly founded town was on the north side, a log building, home to the Star Drug Store operated by Dr. R.W. Eddleman and Alexander Cook, who came by covered wagon in 1852 from Missouri. Dr. Eddleman's brother-in- law, Major James Walcott, also built a general store on the northeast corner of the new town square. The town got its name from being the highest point in the area, thus an observation point for crossing the Trinity River. The wagon pilots nicknamed it \\"the Pilot's Point\\" long before the town existed. On October 13, 1908, several Holiness Christian groups came together and formed the Church of the Nazarene at Pilot Point. A memorial commemorating the event is located at the local Church of the Nazarene facility, about two blocks west of U.S. Highway 377. Other churches in the community hold particular historical significance in the community.

History Sanger was founded in 1886 as a stop on the Santa Fe Railroad. Cattle from the ranches of north Denton County were driven up the old cattle trails through Sanger to northern markets. The cattle industry of the prairies of north Denton County contributed to the founding of the town, and wheat growing contributed substantially to its economy, as did the production of oats, maize, millet and cotton. The Santa Fe named Sanger in honor of one of its customers, the Sanger family, who owned stores in Waco and Dallas. The F.M. Ready family was the first to settle in Sanger in October 1887, the same year as the first engine and caboose. Following the decline of the original rail line (the line still exists as a main line for BNSF Railway between Fort Worth and Oklahoma City), the 1920 building of a state highway that connected Sanger and Dallas helped compensate for the declining rail business. Cattle and other livestock are raised around Sanger, and there are several horse farms for the breeding and training of registered stock. The oldest continual business was Wilson Lumber Company, founded by Andy Marshall Wilson in the 1890s. His son, T.C. (Tilford Clifton Wilson), expanded the business and was the longest serving city councilman and mayor in Sanger history. Wilson Lumber Company was finally sold by the family in 2001, becoming Denton County Building Supply.

History There was a Shady Shores Independent School in 1912. In the mid-1920s, John William Franck, a Dallas contractor, built a fishing camp with about ten wood-shingle cabins on the northern shores of Lake Dallas. He had this in mind as a weekend retreat for Dallas residents. In the 1930s, many of the fishing camps were torn down and replaced by permanent homes, a number of which are still standing. The community thrived, and in 1932, a nearby subdivision called Shady Shores began construction. The lake was enlarged in the late 1950s, becoming what is now known as Lewisville Lake. In 1960, the city leaders decided to incorporate ‚Äì mostly to escape being annexed by Denton ‚Äì and the subdivision's name became the name of a newly formed town. Up until 2000, when tax collection began, money for road repairs and police and fire protection came from fees from building permits, franchise fees, pancake suppers and donations from the residents. Education The Town of Shady Shores is served by the Lake Dallas Independent School District and Denton Independent School Districts. The library for the area is the Lake Cities Library.

Cuero's population grew considerably in the 1870s and 1880s, as residents from the coastal town of Indianola, Texas, settled here after major hurricanes in this period destroyed sizeable portions of that city. Cuero thrived through much of the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the introduction and practice of turkey ranching in the area. Today, agriculture is still the primary industry in the region. Cuero is considered to be one of the top cattle producers and shippers in Texas.

History The city was founded by Captain John York and Charles Eckhardt and named in honor of Captain John York, a famous Indian fighter and was in command of a company of citizens who, under Ben Milam, defeated General Cos in 1835 at the Siege of B√©xar. For his military services, York received many acres of land in the Coleto Creek area. Charles Eckhardt started a mercantile business in Indianola which at that time was a major Texas seaport. Eckhardt participated in the Texas Revolution and may have met Captain York during military service. Eckhardt contracted with John A. King, one of the pioneers of West Texas, to survey a road from Indianola through Yorktown to New Braunfels, later known as the Old Indianola Trail. From its inception in February, 1848, this road remained the chief thoroughfare for this part of the state to New Braunfels and San Antonio. This trail shortened the former route by twenty miles and established Yorktown as an important relay station for freighters, prairie schooners, trail drivers, and stagecoaches bringing mail and passengers. The came through upper town on North Riedel Street. Early in 1848, after the founders had the proposed town surveyed, they offered and the choice of a lot free to the first ten families to settle the townsite. Many German, Bohemian, Lithuanian and Polish families came and soon changed this wilderness into one of the most prosperous sections of the entire state. In May, 1848, Peter Metz and John Frank built the first house in the settlement of Yorktown for Charles Eckhardt. It was built of logs, twelve by twenty feet, with a back room and chimney. This house was later occupied by a brother, Caesar Eckhardt, who was the founder of C. Eckhardt and Sons Mercantile Company, known for half a century as the leading firm of its kind in western DeWitt County. Unfortunately, neither of the founders lived to see the town develop beyond this point. In October 1848, in a battle with Marauding Indians, Captain York and his son-in-law, James Madison Bell, were killed. They were buried in a single hand-made coffin in the Yorktown Cemetery some seven miles (11 km) east of Yorktown; a historical marker designates York's grave. In 1852, on an inspection of some of his properties in Central America, Eckhardt contracted yellow fever and died at sea on his return trip. He is buried in New Orleans. The Eckhardts did not have any children while the Yorks had ten children. The Catholics established a church in 1867 and the Lutherans in 1872. The huge oak tree on the lawn of the latter church is one of the oldest in the state. The town was incorporated in 1871. (Data collected from www.yorktowntx.com) Western Days Celebrated on the third weekend of October, Western Days is a three-day town celebration featuring a carnival, barbecue cook-off, horseshoes and washers tournaments, quilt show, poker run, and street dancing. Western Days is held downtown at the city park. Numerous food booths and art and craft stands line the streets. Saturday morning begins with a large parade through town. Western days is one of the few festivals in the area that charges no admission to the park or dance. Officially started in 1958, Western Days has its roots dating from the early to mid 1950s with Leslie and Cecil Mueller's M&M; Rodeo Company organizing cowboy parades to promote the rodeo performances on Smith Creek, just south of Yorktown. A showman and promoter, Leslie Mueller gathered the rodeo cowboys to ride horseback through downtown Yorktown. These processions were said to have been quite a wild sight. Since there were not enough broke saddle horses to go around, many of the cowboys paraded down Main on broncs right out of the bucking horse string. In the spring of 1958 Mueller, in cooperation with the Yorktown Chamber of Commerce, planned a Western parade to involve the entire community, as well as out-of-town organizations. A two-day rodeo was planned as well. Mueller pledged a pair of handmade boots to the parade's best-dressed cowgirl, while the Chamber promised boots to the best-dressed cowboy. Other prizes were pledged from community businesses such as Daniel Dry Gods, Simecek's Firestone, J. E. Wolf Sr. and Cole Dry goods. The April 2, 1958, edition of The Yorktown News reported that the parade was \\"conceived on the spur of the moment, with no time make elaborate plans, appoint committees or work out details‚Ä¶.\\" The newspaper further reported that the success of the venture was due \\"‚Ä¶to the spontaneous and whole-hearted cooperation of local business men‚Ä¶\\" In spite of this last-minute planning, on Saturday, March 29 at 3 p.m. Yorktown welcomed a crowd that jammed the downtown sidewalks to see the parade led by the VFW Color Guard. The \\"Bronc Busters\\" (the Yorktown High School marching band), led by Mary Gail Kerlick, followed close behind. The parade featured the famous Lone Star Brewing Company Shetland Pony Hitch. This team of matched Shetlands was outfitted with ten gallon hats and six shooters and pulled a miniature covered wagon. A parade highlight was Monroe Woods' mustang team pulling a frontier wagon carrying an ancient two-seater Chick Sale (outhouse), complete with corn cobs and a Sears catalog. The parade also included colorfully-garbed mounted groups, several floats, new tractors, trucks and automobiles, as well as the four-piece Disintegrated Brotherhood of Near Musicians. With a broom and shovel, Sparky, the rodeo clown, brought up the rear and proclaimed that Yorktown was not a one-horse town indeed. The Yorktown News also reported that most of the western parade watchers \\"‚Ä¶hightailed it out to Les Mueller's Smith Creek Arena‚Ä¶to take in the rodeo....We saw cars bumper to bumper all the way over the hill and as they wended their way into the grounds more and more kept coming....The show got underway about nine o'clock, and a thriller it was‚Ä¶with mean, ornery broncs and bulls, and fast elusive calves, there were plenty of spills, thrills and chills‚Ä¶as good a show as we've seen anywhere.\\" Rodeo events included calf roping, bareback bronc riding, bull riding, bull dogging, saddle bronc riding and the ladies' barrel race. The performance also featured Tab Evans and his trained hog, Pork Chop and his trained dog, Wheeler. After the success of the first parade and rodeo, the Yorktown Chamber of Commerce continued the celebration annually. In 1962 the Chamber sponsored the first Western Days royal court with Jo Ann Boone crowned as queen. For nearly two decades, M&M; Rodeo Company produced a rodeo in conjunction with the Western Days celebration. Throughout the years, the rodeos featured celebrated cowboys such as Bud Humphrey, Glen Dorn, Pat Doyle, Glenn McQueen, Billy Bridges, Cotton Proctor, Sonny Berry and Phil Lyne. Working ranch cowboys from the area who rode as pick-up men included Carl Hoefling, John Horny and Lester Davis. Raymond Stoebner of Victoria served as rodeo announcer while renowned rodeo bull fighters Darrel \\"Sparky\\" Sparkman and Billy Willis entertained the crowd with clown antics while protecting the bull riders. Willis died recently in Waco at age 68. In 1962 Mueller constructed a new arena on his ranch north of Yorktown on Highway 240 in the small community once known as Little St. Louis and the rodeos were moved from the Smith Creek arena. In July 1963 Mueller died after a horseback riding accident during a rodeo in Cuero. However, the Western Days rodeos continued with Mueller's widow, Cecil Olivia Gilliam Mueller and son Don, managing M&M; Rodeo Company. The last rodeo they produced in Yorktown was in 1975. Today, Western Days continues to draw parade participants from surrounding counties, as well as visitors from across the country. The thousands who come to Yorktown each year enjoy not only the Grand Parade, but live music and entertainment, chili cook-offs, various contests, shopping and the genuine fellowship of the townspeople ‚Äì the spirit out of which the celebration was born 55 years ago.The Yorktown News-View, Special Section, October 16, 2013, page 8 http://issuu.com/cuerorecord/docs/western_days_special_section Notable people Harlon Block *Harlon Block, one of the soldiers pictured in Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima *Ox Eckhardt, Major League Baseball player ReferencesExternal links *Community website *Yorktown Independent School District *\\"Scenes of Yorktown, TX\\" Footage of daily life in Yorktown in 1940.

The population was 3,899 at the 2010 census. History Cisco, at the intersection of U.S. Highway 183 and Interstate 20 in northwestern Eastland County, traces its history back to 1878 or 1879, when Rev. C. G. Stevens arrived in the area, established a post office and a church, and called the frontier settlement \\"Red Gap\\". About six families were already living nearby, and W. T. Caldwell was running a store a half mile to the west. In 1881, the Houston and Texas Central Railway crossed the Texas and Pacific, which had come through the year before, at a point near Red Gap, and the settlement's inhabitants moved their town to the crossing. The date the rails crossed, May 17, 1881, is considered by some to be Cisco's \\"birthday.\\" Three years later, the town was officially recognized and a new post office granted; the town's name was changed to \\"Cisco\\" for John A. Cisco, a New York financier largely responsible for the building of the Houston and Texas Central. Railroads continued to influence the development of Cisco as the Texas and Pacific acquired lots in the town and sold them to immigrants attracted by brochures touting the town as the \\"Gate City of the West\\". Once settlers arrived, agricultural agents employed by the railroad advised them what and when to plant and on occasion provided the seed. During the 1880s, a Mrs. Haws built and managed the first hotel, and Mrs. J. D. Alexander brought the first \\"millinery and fancy goods\\" to town. Following a practice common at the time, religious groups in Cisco met together for prayer meetings in the schoolhouse until they could build separate churches. By 1892, Cisco was a growing community with two newspapers, a bank, and an economy based on trade, ranching, fruit farming, and the limestone, coal, and iron ore available nearby. A broom factory and roller corn and flour mills were among the town's 56 businesses. At 8 PM on Friday, April 28, 1893, an F4 tornado struck the center of the business district of Cisco, killing 28 people and destroying or severely damaging every building in town. The city hall, every church and school, and an estimated 500 homes were destroyed. Conrad Hilton started the Hilton Hotel chain with a single hotel bought in Cisco. Hilton came to Cisco to buy a bank, but the bank cost too much, so he purchased the Mobley Hotel in 1919. The hotel is now a local museum and community center.Hilton, Conrad Nicholson (Texas State Historical Association) During the 1920s, Cisco, like nearby Ranger, Eastland, and Desdemona, was a petroleum boomtown.Cisco, Texas in the Handbook of Texas (Texas State Historical Association) Although Cisco played a relatively minor role in the Eastland County oil boom of 1919‚Äì21, its population grew rapidly at the time, with some estimates as high as 15,000; in the wake of the boom, Cisco adopted a city charter and built a new railroad station that cost $25,000, a value of $310,597.88 in 2015. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hgc06 In 1925, the first annual meeting of the West Texas Historical Association was held in Cisco. The association, formed in 1924, was then based at Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University in Abilene, but moved in 1998 to Texas Tech University in Lubbock. The Santa Claus Bank Robbery occurred in Cisco on December 23, 1927, when Marshall Ratliff and his gang attempted to rob the First National Bank.

Largest concrete swimming pool in the world Cisco in its early days was plagued with inadequate water supply. In the 1920s, the Williamson Dam was built north of town, resulting in the formation of Lake Cisco. The dam was named after James Milton Williamson, long-time mayor and survivor of the 1893 tornado. At its base was built what was billed as the largest concrete swimming pool in the world. The complex boasted a two-story building with a skating rink upstairs, a zoo, an amusement park with rides, and a park. Bob Wills was only one of the celebrities to entertain there. For decades, it was a major attraction for folks from miles around. The hollow dam was at one time open to the public, but this is no longer the case. The pool closed in the 1970s and the vacant skating rink burned a few years later.Talk:Cisco, Texas Geography Cisco is located in northwestern Eastland County at (32.384762, -98.981265).

Eastland is known for the legend of \\"Old Rip\\", a horned toad that lived many years sealed in the cornerstone of the previous Eastland courthouse built in 1897. The recession of 1921 exacerbated racial tensions between Anglos and Mexicans. Naturally, unemployment increased in town and whites attempted to oust Mexicans whom were hired during the WWI boom. Masked men ravaged shacks used by Mexicans as living quarters. Whites threatened Mexicans' lives and fearful, they fled to nearby Fort Worth to seek help from the Mexican Consulate since local authorities took the side of the Anglo locals.Chicano!

History The first settlers arrived in the area that is now Rising Star on January 10, 1875. The original seven families were the families of William \\"Allie\\" Wylie Smith, G. A., Andrew \\"Big Andy\\" Smith, Andrew \\"Little Andy\\" Agnew, William \\"Billy\\" Agnew, Fletcher Fields, and D. M. (Dave) McKinley. The seven families were all related to each other through the Agnew line. Large amounts of land were found to be available for purchase in the area, because the state of Texas kept all unappropriated and vacant land after joining the Union 30 years prior. This land belonged to the state, which sold it to finance the construction of the public school system and state universities. The state gave a portion of its land to railroad companies to sell. This encouraged and helped railroad lines to be developed throughout Texas. Because of this, almost all of the land in Eastland County was either school land or railroad land. Settlers could buy railroad land for $3.00 per acre and school land for as low as $1.00 per acre with no down payment and about 20‚Äì40 years to pay off the land. Most of these East Texas families purchased land from the railroad companies. Other families soon began to move into the area and purchase land. Some of the families that settled later were the Anderson, Irby, Roach, Cox, Hull, Leach, Haynes, Wynn, Mayfield, and Swindle families. No mail routes existed initially in this newly settled frontier, but by about 1880, the community became a stop on a mail route between Cisco and Brownwood. Prior to the establishment of this mail route, the families received mail from Sipe Springs. In 1881, the town sent a petition to the U.S. government asking for a new post office in the area. The community leaders were required to suggest a name for the post office and decided upon the name Star, which was then sent for approval to the Postal Service. The Postal Service sent word back that a post office under the name Star was already located in Texas (in Mills County). The citizens called a meeting to select another name, and after many long hours of deliberation, Little Andy Agnew proposed, \\"Since we are a rising young community, why don't we just call ourselves Rising Star.\\" The name was agreed to and accepted by the Postal Service.Rising Star Texas; A Brief History of the Early Community by A. P. Smith, 1984. From 1910 through 1911, a spur of the Texas Central line (Katy Railroad) was constructed to the west 40 miles from De Leon to Cross Plains through Rising Star. The Katy abandoned the spur in the 1940s. Education The town is served by the Rising Star Independent School District and is home to the Rising Star High School Wildcats.

Education Public education in the community of Canutillo is provided by the Canutillo Independent School District. The History of Canutillo ISD El Paso County was in charge of schools when the first school building was constructed in Canutillo in 1911. The school was named, The Lone Star School. Its school boundaries extended from White Spur (now in West El Paso) to La Tuna, Texas, and from the New Mexico boundary line to the Franklin Mountains - making the district about thirteen miles long and six miles wide. Nineteen hundred and eleven was a very promising year for Canutillo for many places of business opened. Among these was the first general merchandise store owned by W.H. Glenn, J.B. Kilpatrick, P.H.Bailey, and Harry Bailey. The Santa Fe Railroad station was also built in 1911, and of course, this boosted the town, for up to this time it had been only a flag station. In 1911, Fernando Carrasco, owner of the Julimes Teatro, started a grocery store and barber shop. Two years later, James Heminger started the first blacksmith shop, J.R.Montfort opened a harness shop, and the Canutillo Lumber Co. was opened by Thomas B. Atkins. Canutillo was growing and so was its school. By the 1920s, the school building was enlarged to ten rooms, seven classrooms, a lunchroom, and two lavatories with shower baths. For the 1923-24 school year, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades were added and total enrollment was 350 students. Canutillo students interested in continuing their education after eighth grade had to travel almost 15 miles to attend El Paso High School. This continued through the 1950s. On April 18, 1959, Canutillo Independent School District was officially in operation. From that time on, much was needed to be done to get this fledgling school district on its feet. Work began immediately on prioritizing the new school district's needs. A Board of Trustees had to be voted into office, a superintendent had to be hired, a tax collections office had to be set up, plans for the construction of school facilities to include a high school needed to be developed, among other important issues. Canutillo ISD's first Board of Trustees members were: Robert Gilbert, who was elected president; Ruth Blount, T.J. Warren, Kenneth Bouma, Louise Seymour, Radford C. Pinckard, and Gonzalo (Chalo) Garcia. After the first year, Bouma stepped down and E. W. (Gene) Chandler was appointed. Hired as CISD's first superintendent was Joseph MacDougall, who had been the principal of Canutillo's elementary school since 1957 under the county school district. MacDougall remained through 1965, when he was appointed as head of the then new federal program, Project Bravo, for the El Paso region. Having MacDougall as executive director of Project Bravo facilitated the Canutillo community's efforts for initiating much needed social services including youth sports programs, health services for the elderly, and the Head Start initiative for pre-school children. By 1962, CISD had passed a $330,000 bond issue to add a classroom wing for high school students next to the existing elementary school, which was located at the intersection of Fifth and Central Streets. In 1963, Canutillo ISD graduated its first senior class. And by 1964, CISD's enrollment was 1,013 students. The new school district struggled through the rest of the 1960s as it experienced growing pains. By 1971, Canutillo ISD school facilities were too small to house all grade levels- kindergarten through twelfth. Consequently, school officials developed a split-shift daily schedule to accommodate the junior and high school students. In 1973, CISD voters passed its second bond issue for $800,000 for a new high school. The new high school was built on 30 acres of land on Bosque Road that was purchased from the El Paso Public Service Board (PSB). The high school opened for the 1974-75 school year. By 1979, CISD officials were ready to move on their plans for a middle school. Another bond issue was passed and work on the middle school campus on Talbot Road was completed. Canutillo Middle School was open for the 1980-81 school year. In 1987, Canutillo voters passed a $7.1 million bond issue for construction of two new elementary schools: Jose H. Damian Elementary School in the Borderland area and Deanna Davenport Elementary School in the Westway community. In 1994, Canutillo ISD voters passed a $10 million bond issue that provided for the Bill Childress Elementary School, a Support Services & Transportation Facility and for phase one of the new Canutillo Elementary School. In 1998, CISD completed phase one of Canutillo Elementary School for $2.9 million including 18 classrooms, main offices, library, and cafetorium. In 1999, phase two of Canutillo Elementary School was completed for $3.2 million including 30 more classrooms and other campus needs. In 1999, CISD Board of Trustees called for a $23 million bond referendum to build a new high school, and voters overwhelmingly passed it by 96 percent. School officials secured 71 percent of the cost through the state's Instructional Facilities Allotment program. Site selection for the new campus was an arduous endeavor with community residents having input every step of the way. After considering seven different locations, an advisory committee recommended to the School Board and the Board approved a 50-acre site located west of Interstate-10 next to EPCC's Northwest Campus. In April 2003, CISD voters again gave their vote of confidence and passed another bond issue for $12.3 million, $5 million for district-wide maintenance and renovation projects and $7.3 million earmarked for the new high school construction. With the additional funds, school officials were able to enhance the design to ensure a comprehensive campus for at least 1,800 students. In designing the new campus, architects held several meetings with interested community residents and Canutillo High School faculty and staff to elicit needs and suggestions. In 2006, CISD voters passed a $39 million bond issue that provided for the construction of two new elementary schools and enhancements to existing schools. CISD's fifth elementary campus, Gonzalo & Sofia Garcia Elementary School welcomed students into the new facility in April 2008. In the fall of 2008, CISD and El Paso Community College joined efforts to open the Northwest Early College High School, CISD's second high school, which provides high school students the opportunity to obtain a high school diploma and associate degree in four years. NECHS opened its doors with only 100 ninth grade students in 2008, and added a new class of 100 freshmen each subsequent year, graduating its first class in 2011. NECHS is located on the EPCC campus, adjacent door to CHS. CISD voters supported the district once again by passing a $44 million bond issue and tax ratification election (TRE) in April 2011, which was well known as Decision 2011. The bond issue provided for additional funding needed to build the district's tenth school as well as make needed upgrades to existing schools. In summer 2013, CISD broke ground on its tenth campus, Congressman Silvestre and Carolina Reyes PK-8 School. The school is tentatively scheduled to open in the spring of 2015.

Then on 7 November 1848, War Department General Order no. 58 ordered the establishment of a post NOTE: At the time of its creation, the first post occupied territory that was considered to be part of New Mexico, and the post remained the strongest military encampment in New Mexico until the 32nd parallel north was designated the official boundary between New Mexico and Texas in 1850. across from El Paso del Norte (now Ciudad Ju√°rez). On 8 September 1849, the garrison party of several companies of the 3rd U.S. Infantry ('The Old Guard', currently the oldest active duty regiment in the US Army), commanded by Major Jefferson Van Horne, found only four small and scattered settlements on the north side of the Rio Grande. The Post Opposite El Paso del Norte was first established at the site of Coon's Ranch (often erroneously referred to as Smith's Ranch, now downtown El Paso) and, along with Fort Selden and other Southwestern outposts, protected recently won territory from harassing Apaches and Comanches, provided law and order, and escorted the forty-niners. Van Horne also had nominal command of the Post at San Elizario, the former Presidio of San Elizario, seventeen miles downstream from El Paso del Norte. With constant Indian raids, garrisons had to be moved frequently to meet the shifting threats. In September 1851, the Post Opposite El Paso and the Post at San Elizario were closed, the soldiers moved north to Fort Fillmore. = Post of El Paso (1854), Fort Bliss, (1854-1868) = On 11 January 1854, Companies B, E, I and K of the 8th Infantry, under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund B. Alexander, established Post of El Paso at Magoffinsville under orders from Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. Frank Mangan (1971), in El Paso in Pictures, Texas A&M; Press, locates the Magoffinsville post at the intersection of Magoffin and Willow streets, based on photographic inspection of the contours of Mount Franklin in a photograph of Fort Bliss. The post was named 'Fort Bliss' on 8 March 1854 in honor of Lt. Col. William Wallace Smith Bliss, a veteran of the Mexican War (1846-1848) who was cited for gallantry in action. There it remained for the next 14 years, serving as a base for troops guarding the area against Apache attacks. Until 1861 most of these troops were units of the 8th Infantry Brigade. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, David E. Twiggs, the Commander of the Department of Texas, ordered the garrison to surrender Fort Bliss to the Confederacy, which Col. Isaac Van Duzen Reeve did on 31 March 1861. Confederate forces consisting of the 2nd Regiment of Texas, under the command of Col. John R. Baylor, took the post on 1 July 1861, and used it as a platform to launch attacks into New Mexico and Arizona in an effort to force the Union garrisons still in these states to surrender. Initially the Confederate Army had success in their attempts to gain control of New Mexico, but following the Battle of Glorieta Pass, Confederate soldiers were forced to retreat. The Confederate garrison abandoned Fort Bliss without a fight the next year when a Federal column of 2,350 men under the command of Colonel James H. Carleton advanced from California. The Californians maintained an irregular garrison at Fort Bliss until 1865, when 5th Infantry units arrived to reestablish the post; these were subsequently relieved by the 25th Infantry, Buffalo Soldiers, on 12 August 1866, followed by the 35th Infantry two months later. = Camp Concordia (1868‚Äì1876) = After May 1867 Rio Grande flooding seriously damaged the Magoffinsville post, Fort Bliss was moved to a site called 'Camp Concordia' in March 1868. Camp Concordia's location was immediately south of what is now Interstate 10, across from Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. The Rio Grande was about a mile south of the camp at that time; water was hauled daily by mule team to the camp. On 11 March 1869 the old name of Fort Bliss was resumed. Water, heating, and sanitation facilities were at a minimum in the adobe buildings of the fort; records reveal that troops suffered severely from dysentery and malaria and that supplies arrived irregularly over the Santa Fe Trail by wagon train. The Concordia post was abandoned in January 1877, and after troops left in January, El Paso was without a garrison for more than a year. By that time, the town and its environs on the north side of the river had swelled to a population of almost 800. = Hart's Mill (1878‚Äì1893) = Aerial view of Fort Bliss, 1968, with N-El Paso in background. On New Year's Day,1878, Fort Bliss was established as a permanent post; the Company L Buffalo Soldiers of the Ninth Cavalry and Company C of the 15th Infantry, were sent to Fort Bliss to prevent further trouble over the salt beds and the usage of Rio Grande water for irrigation purposes. Prior to this date, the government had had a policy of simply leasing property for its military installations. Now, however, a tract of was purchased at Hart's Mill on the river's edge in the Pass, near what is today the UTEP. With a $40,000 appropriation, a building program was begun. The first railroad arrived in 1881, and tracks were laid across the military reservation, thereby solving the supply problems for the fort and the rapidly growing town of El Paso. By 1890, Hart's Mill had outlived its usefulness, and Congress appropriated $150,000 for construction of a military installation on the mesa approximately east of El Paso's 1890 city limits. Although no money was appropriated for the land, $8,250 was easily raised by the local residents, who realized the economic benefit to the area.

Pershing arrivedNOTE: After a year at Fort Bliss, Pershing decided to arrange for his family to join him. The arrangements were almost complete when, on the morning of 27 August 1915, he received a telegram telling him of a fire in the Presidio of San Francisco. His wife and three young daughters had been burned to death; only his six- year-old son Warren had been saved. Many who knew Pershing said that he never recovered from the deaths of his wife and daughters. After the funerals at Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Pershing returned to Fort Bliss with his son, Warren, and his sister Mae, and resumed his duties as commanding officer. in El Paso to take command of the Army 8th Brigade that was stationed at Fort Bliss. At the time, the Mexican Revolution was underway in Mexico, and the 8th Brigade had been assigned the task of securing the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. In March 1915, under the command of General Frederick Funston, Pershing led the 8th Brigade on the failed 1916‚Äì1917 Punitive Expedition into Mexico in search of outlaw Pancho Villa.NOTE: During the Pancho Villa Expedition, General Pershing was assigned a 1915 Dodge Brothers touring car, serial number 3066, and George S. Patton served as one of Pershing's aides. [This footnote should be moved to the Pancho Villa Expedition wikipage.] On Friday, 11 March 2016, members of the 2nd Squadron, 13th Cavalry Regiment, (3rd BCT, 1st Armored Division, Fort Bliss) conducted a staff ride at Pancho Villa State Park, NM, the former site of Camp Furlong, 2nd Squadron's billet in 1915.

World War I and postwar As American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) commander (1917‚Äì1918), John J. Pershing transferred to Fort Bliss and was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of an inexperienced force that eventually grew from 27,000 men to over 2,000,000‚Äîthe National Army of World War I. From 10 December 1917 ‚Äì 12 May 1918, the wartime 15th Cavalry Division existed at Fort Bliss. Similarly, the Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade was initially activated at Fort Bliss on 10 December 1917 and then deactivated in July 1919, but then reactivated at Fort Bliss on 31 August 1920. Predominantly a cavalry post since 1912, Fort Bliss acquired three light armored cars, eight medium armored cars, two motorcycles, and two trucks on 8 November 1928. World War II and postwar During World War II, Fort Bliss focused on training anti-aircraft artillery battalions (AAA). In September 1940 the Coast Artillery's anti-aircraft training center was established, and in 1941 the 1st Tow Target Squadron arrived to fly target drones (the 6th, 19th, and 27th Tow Target Squadrons were at the nearby Biggs Field). On 3 August 1944, the Anti-Aircraft Artillery School was ordered from Camp Davis to Fort Bliss to make the training of anti-aircraft gunners easier, and they became the dominant force at Fort Bliss following the departure of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. On 15 September 1942, the War Dept. made space available for handling up to 1,350 POWs, while POW camps could be constructed. During the war, the base was used to hold approximately 91 German and Italian Americans and Japanese from Hawaii (then a territory), who were arrested as potential fifth columnists but, in most cases, denied due process.\\"Fort Bliss\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 12 June 2014) Group of 104 Operation Paperclip rocket scientists in 1946 at Fort Bliss (35 were at White Sands Proving Grounds) By February 1946, over 100 Operation Paperclip German scientists had arrived to develop rockets and were attached to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Service, Suboffice (Rocket), headed by Major James P. Hamill. Although the scientists were initially \\"pretty much kept on ice\\" (resulting in the nickname \\"Operation Icebox\\"), they were subsequently divided into a research group and a group who assisted with V-2 test launches at White Sands Proving Grounds. German families began arriving in December 1946, and by the spring of 1948, the number of German rocket specialists (nicknamed \\"Prisoners of Peace\\") in the US was 127. Fort Bliss rocket launches included firings of the Private missile at the Hueco Range in April 1945. NOTE: In 1948, the United States honored the 100th year of Fort Bliss with a commemorative stamp depicting a rocket launch, the first stamp ever issued by the US related to space efforts or to depict a rocket. In 1953, funding cuts caused the cancellation of work on the Hermes B2 ramjet work that had begun at Fort Bliss. NOTE: On 3 September 1948, FBI informant PT-1 reported a Fort Bliss barber had been recruited to send missile photographs and information to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.p406 In late 1953 after troops had been trained at the Ft Bliss Guided Missile School, field-firing operations of the MGM-5 Corporal were underway at Red Canyon Range Camp, WSPG. In April 1950, the 1st Guided Missile Group named the Republic-Ford JB-2 the ARMY LOON. Cold War Fort Bliss facility map of main area in 1974 Fort Bliss trained thousands of U.S. Soldiers during the Cold War. As the United States gradually came to master the art of building and operating missiles, Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range became more and more important to the country, and were expanded accordingly. On 1 July 1957 the U.S. Army Air Defense Center was established at Fort Bliss. Located at this Center, in addition to Center Headquarters, are the U.S. Army Air Defense School; Air Defense; the 6th Artillery Group (Air Defense); the 61st Ordnance Group; and other supporting elements.During this time the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment was also assigned to Fort Bliss, and later relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. In 1957 Fort Bliss and its anti-aircraft personnel began using Nike Ajax, Nike Hercules, Hawk, Sprint, Chaparral, and Redeye missiles.NOTE: Two other surface-to-surface missile systems‚ÄîLaCrosse and Honest John‚Äî were based at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, but would frequently come to Fort Bliss for the purpose of conducting live fire exercises. Fort Bliss took on the important role of providing a large area for troops to conduct live fire exercises with the missiles. Because of the large number of Army personnel enrolled in the air defense school, Fort Bliss saw two large rounds of construction in 1954 and 1958. The former was aimed at creating more barracks facilities, while the latter was aimed at building new classrooms, materials labs, a radar park, and a missile laboratory. Between 1953 and 1957 the Army also expanded McGregor Range in an effort to accommodate live fire exercises of the new missile systems. Throughout the Cold War Fort Bliss remained a premier site for testing anti-aircraft equipment. Fort Bliss was used as the Desert Stage of the Ranger School training course to prepare Ranger School graduates for operations in the deserts of the Middle East. From 1983 to 1987, Fort Bliss was home to the Ranger School's newly formed 4th (Desert Ranger) Training Company. This unit was later expanded in 1987 to form the newly created Ranger Training Brigade's short-lived 7th Ranger Training Battalion, which was then transferred to the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. The deserts of Utah proved to be unsuitable so the 7th Ranger Training Battalion was returned to Fort Bliss from 1991 until the Ranger School's Desert Phase was discontinued in 1995. While the United States Army Air Defense Artillery School develops doctrine and tactics, training current and future soldiers has always been its core mission. Until 1990 the post was used for Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), under the 1/56 ADA Regiment, part of 6th ADA. Before 1989, 1/56 had three basic training companies and two AIT batteries. After 1990, 1/56 dropped basic training, that mission assumed by Fort Sill. The unit now had four enlisted batteries for enlisted AIT, one battery for the Officer's Basic Course and Captain's Career Course (added in 2004) and one company that trained army truck drivers (MOS 88M). Patriot Missile fires from its launch canister. Base Realignment and Closure In 1995, the Department of Defense recommended that the U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment be relocated to Fort Carson, Colorado. Efforts to consolidate units from another post with those units that remained at Fort Bliss were overruled by the Base Realignment and Closing Commission, leaving Fort Bliss without any armored vehicles. Units operating the US Army's MIM-104 Patriot Missile Defense System relocated to Fort Bliss during the 1990s. The Patriot system played an important role in the Persian Gulf War/Operation Desert Storm in 1991. In commemoration, the US 54 expressway in northeast El Paso was designated the Patriot Freeway. War on Terror After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Fort Bliss provided ADA Battalions for US and NATO use in Afghanistan and Iraq, and has served as one of the major deployment centers for troops bound for Iraq and Afghanistan. This mission is accomplished via nearby Biggs Army Airfield, which is included in the installation's supporting areas. Following the War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) in 2001 Fort Bliss began training Afghan security forces at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy at Fort Bliss, with the hope that these newly trained soldiers would eventually be able to take control of their own national security. Base Realignment and Closure, 2005 In 2005, the Pentagon recommended transforming Fort Bliss into a heavy armor training post, to include approximately 11,500 new troops from the U.S. 1st Armored Division ‚Äì at that time stationed in Germany -, as well as units from Fort Sill and Fort Hood. An estimated 15,918 military jobs and 384 civilian jobs were planned to be transferred to Fort Bliss, brought the total number of troops stationed at Fort Bliss under this alignment to a total of 33,500 by 2012.http://archive.elpasotimes.com/opinion/ci_28470604/editorial-fort-bliss- sees-modest-cuts-army-shrinks/ Officials from Fort Bliss and the City of El Paso were thrilled with the decision; the general mood of the city government was perfectly captured by 14 May edition of the El Paso Times, which boldly proclaimed \\"BLISS WINS BIG\\". According to Senator Eliot Shapleigh, the BRAC commission considered three primary factors to make its decision: The military value of Fort Bliss, the potential for other branches of the armed service to use a post as large as Fort Bliss, and the lack of urban encroachment around Fort Bliss that would otherwise hinder its growth. The arrival of the 11,500 troops from the 1st Armored Division is also expected to create some 20,196 direct and indirect military and civilian jobs in El Paso. According to the Department of Defense, this is the largest net gain in the United States tied to the Base Realignment and Closure recommendations. Of the 20,196 new jobs expected to come to El Paso as a result of Bliss‚Äô realignment 9,000 would be indirect civilian jobs created by the influx of soldiers to the \\"Sun City\\". When the BRAC commission recommendations were released Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's spokesman reported that El Paso was the only area that came out with a major gain of forces. The news that El Paso had been selected to receive major elements of the 1st Armored Division was met with joy, but at the same time many expressed surprise at the panel's recommendation to transfer the Air Defense Artillery School, 6th ADA Brigade, and its accompanying equipment (including the MIM-104 Patriot Missile Anti- Aircraft/Anti Missile defense system) to Fort Sill. On 25 August officials representing Fort Bliss went before the BRAC Commission to plead their case for maintaining the ADA school and its accompanying equipment at Fort Bliss, citing among other thing the size of Fort Bliss and the history of the ADA school in the region. The BRAC Commission ultimately ruled against Fort Bliss, The cost savings for not moving the ADA school were found to be smaller than the effect of consolidating 8 smaller locations into 4 Joint Pre- Deployment/Mobilization Platforms, of which Fort Bliss/Holloman is one. accessdate=03 August 2009 and the roughly 4,500 affected soldiers were transferred to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. The entire transfer of soldiers to and from Fort Bliss was completed no later than 15 September 2011. On 25 June 2009, authority over the post was shifted from Training and Doctrine Command to Forces Command. Building 500 area of Fort Bliss, 2007 Present day Among Fort Bliss' missions: * Provide anti-aircraft and missile defense capabilities. * Conduct live fire exercises of nearly every type of Army weapon. * Host joint military exercises with other U.S. and foreign units,For example, *Japan's Air Self-Defense Force held its 50th annual training exercise at Fort Bliss, with live-fire from its inventory, which includes Patriot missiles, in Fall of 2014 accessdate=2014-11-19 * Be home to many maintenance crews and supply units. * Be one of the Army's premier bases for test-driving tanks and other equipment. * House thousands of military vehicles, including all the equipment needed to set up Patriot missile sites. * Hosted the USAADCEN Air Defense Artillery Center from 1942 to 2010. USAADCEN has completed its transfer to Fort Sill. Concomitantly, the German Air Force Air Defense school is going to move to new training facilities in Germany and Greece. In 2013, the German Air Force deactivated its presence at Fort Bliss, while retaining a presence at Holloman Air Force Base; over the previous 47 years, over 50,000 German Airmen received training at this command.Sgt.

Training missions are supported by the McGregor Range Complex, located some to the northeast of the main post, in New Mexico. Most of Fort Bliss lies in the state of New Mexico, stretching northeastward along U.S. Route 54 from El Paso County, Texas to the southern boundary of the Lincoln National Forest in Otero County, New Mexico; in addition, much of the northwestward side of Highway 54 is part of the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, ranging from the northern side of Chaparral, New Mexico to the southern boundary of White Sands Missile Range;Rand McNally map of New Mexico, 2003 the main facilities are within the city limits of El Paso, Texas. According to the city zoning map, the post officially resides in Central El Paso.

All of these supporting missions serve the military and retired-military population here, including having served General of the Army Omar N. Bradley in his last days. A new warrior transition complex, located at Marshall and Cassidy roads, was opened in June 2011 to replace the older facility serving the warrior transition battalion. A new location for William Beaumont Army Medical Center, to be located at Spur 601 and Loop 375, is now rescheduled to be completed in September 2019.Vic Kolenc, El Paso Times (12 June 2018) Design errors, delays add $408M in costs to new Fort Bliss hospital complex, audit finds The installation is also close to the El Paso Airport (with easy access from the post via Robert E. Lee Road‚Äî now renamed Buffalo Soldier Road), Highway 54, and Interstate 10. There is a replica of the Magoffinsville site for Fort Bliss on post, simulating the adobe style of construction. Other items of interest include the Buffalo Soldier memorial statue on Buffalo Soldier Road, at the Buffalo Soldier Gate of entry to the post, and a missile museum on Pleasanton Road. The walls of the old Fort Bliss Officers Club contains adobe bricks that are more than a century old. The building now houses a Family Readiness Group, where new personnel can learn about the post's activities and support groups. The Fort Bliss Welcome center, for new arrivals, is nearby, in the Building 500 area.

As of 2005, the base contributed about $1.7 billion to the economy of Central El Paso and Northeast El Paso, and many businesses in the region serve the post's troops. When troops are transferred to other posts or called up for service overseas, the economic fallout can be felt throughout the city. As the U.S. Army began downsizing in 2014, Fort Bliss was expected to lose 1,200 Soldiers from the then-current 33,500 by 2017. Fort Bliss has assisted El Paso during local disasters. In 1897, and again in 1925, the fort provided food and housing to those displaced by flood waters. In 2006, Fort Bliss dispatched soldiers and helicopters to the flood-affected areas to help with rescue efforts there. The flooding of El Paso in 2013 and 2014 were not met with this type of official response. As of July 2010, electric power consumption at Fort Bliss had been reduced by three megawatts as the base continues to work towards becoming a \\"net zero\\" energy installation. In April 2013, Major General Dana J.H. Pittard, USA, announced a $120 million project to be completed by 2015, consisting of the largest solar farm within the U.S. military. A joint study by Fort Bliss and El Paso-area city governments found that desalination was a viable method for increasing El Paso's water supply by 25%.27.5 million gallons of fresh water daily (MGD) for El Paso and Fort Bliss The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant, on Montana Avenue, is located on Fort Bliss property, and desalinates the groundwater of the Hueco Bolson for use by El Paso and Fort Bliss.

Economic Development Corporation Horizon City formed an economic development corporation in 2011. The corporation has the power to use sales tax funds to help eligible companies with relocations, expansions and site development. It can acquire property, finance infrastructure projects and expend funds for a variety of quality of life improvements. History The city, incorporated by referendum on October 22, 1988, takes its name from the real estate development corporation which developed it as a planned community beginning in the early 1960s, the Horizon Corporation. The Horizon Corporation bought up large tracts of land in the southwestern United States, including eastern El Paso County; platted them into subdivisions; and sold lots in them to thousands of people worldwide, often sight unseen, often without access to water or utilities and using questionable sales tactics, between 1962 and 1975. Eventually the Federal Trade Commission stepped in to stop it in 1981.http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_17498314http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_18172193 Only one portion of the development was successful, the area around the intersection of Horizon Boulevard (Texas Farm Road 1281) and Kenazo Street; this became the nucleus of Horizon City. Much of the land to the east of town consists of undeveloped subdivisions with highly fragmented ownership. The lots in these subdivisions cannot be legally sold and will be difficult to develop due to the 1994 Texas Colonia Act, a state law intended to stop the development of colonias, or neighborhoods underserved by utilities whose residents often live in substandard conditions. It forbids the sale for residential purposes of less than 10 acres of land or the sale of more than 10 acres of land without a guarantee of adequate access to water, sewer services and other utilities. Efforts are currently underway by a local homeowners' association, the Horizon Communities Improvement Association, to assemble these lots into tracts of land that can be legally developed.

The population was 13,603 at the 2010 census. It is part of the El Paso Metropolitan Statistical Area. It lies on the Rio Grande, which forms the border between the United States and Mexico. The city of Socorro adjoins it on the west and the town of Clint lies to the north.  History =\\"La Toma\\" The Official Act of Possession In 1598, Don Juan de O√±ate, a Spanish nobleman and conquistador born in Zacatecas, Mexico, led a group of 539 colonists and 7,000 head of livestock (including horses, oxen, and cattle) from southern Chihuahua to settle the province of New Mexico. The caravan traveled a northeasterly route for weeks across the desert until it reached the banks of the Rio Grande in the San Elizario area. A mass was held, a blessing of the standard and a celebration. O√±ate performed the ceremony of La Toma (\\"Taking Possession\\"), in which he claimed the new province for King Philip II of Spain. This is considered to be the \\"Birth of the American Southwest\\".  Hacienda de los Tiburcios  The settlement that became San Elizario was first established sometime before 1760 as the civilian settlement of Hacienda de los Tiburcios. The hacienda was located along the route of Camino Real de Tierra Adentro southeast of Socorro on the west bank of the Rio Grande. The hacienda was eventually abandoned by the 1770s.  Presidio San Elzeario  In 1789, the site of the old hacienda Tiburcios became the new site where the Spaniards relocated a fort called Presidio de San Elzeario. It had originally been established in 1774, located farther south in the El Paso Valley near the site of modern El Porvenir. It had been moved north to be better able to protect the Camino Real and the towns of to its north Socorro and Ysleta.Torok, George D., From the Pass to the Pueblos, El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail, Sunstone Press, Santa Fe, 2012 The town that grew up around the Presidio took its name San Elzeario, or San Elceario (Spanish for Saint Elzear); Saint Elz√©ar of Sabran is the Roman Catholic patron saint of soldiers. After the Americans acquired the town at the end of the Mexican American War its name was Americanized as San Elizario.  San Elizario  San Elizario was El Paso County's original county seat. =Salt War= In 1877, a conflict, the Salt War, broke out between the town and a troop of Texas Rangers. The Rangers surrendered and two rangers were massacred by the local population. The perpetrators then fled into Mexico and the town lost much of its status. = Incorporation = San Elizario was incorporated several times between 1871 and 1911, with another unsuccessful attempt at incorporation made in 1986. On November 5, 2013, San Elizario residents voted to re-incorporate the town, having successfully fought off an attempt by Socorro to annex a portion of it, and San Elizario was officially incorporated when El Paso County Judge Veronica Escobar signed an order of incorporation on November 18, 2013. On May 10, 2014, Maya Sanchez, who led the push to incorporate San Elizario, was elected mayor by a wide margin over two other candidates, while Leticia Hurtado-Miranda, David Cantu, Miguel Najera, Jr., Rebecca Martinez-Juarez, and George Almanzar were elected to the five city council seats.

Education San Elizario is served by the San Elizario Independent School District. San Elizario Chapel San Elizario Chapel (La Capilla de San Elcear) was never a mission, but it functioned as a presidio chapel. It provided the religious needs of a presidio or outpost of military personnel. The presidio was moved to the present site in 1789, to protect travelers and settlers along the Camino Real (Royal Highway)https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/hispanic/2006/sanelizario.htm which ran from Mexico City through Ciudad Ju√°rez, then called \\"Paso del Norte\\", to Santa Fe, New Mexico. Its close proximity to the Ysleta and Socorro missions also provided protection for them. When Mexico became independent from Spain in 1821, the military presence at the presidio decreased. By 1848, the presidio had fallen into ruins. Rebuilding efforts began in 1853, with a small church. This proved inadequate, and the present structure was completed in 1882. The exterior appearance has changed very little since then. The wedding scene for the movie Fandango (1985) was filmed in the plaza of the San Elizario church.

In Spanish and Mexican colonial times, it was known as La Salinera, from the salt cedars which grew there in abundance; when the area passed to the United States after the US- Mexican War, this water stop became known as Cottonwood, and was located in the northern part of Vinton along the river, 22 miles from El Paso. In 1857, it was used by the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and from 1858 to 1861 by the Butterfield Overland Mail, that had a stage station called Cottonwood Station, located 22 miles from El Paso and 25 miles from Fort Fillmore up river in New Mexico.

The population was 728 at the 2010 census. The town is located northeast of Hillsboro and southwest of Waxahachie. The community received media attention due to a Chevron gas pipeline explosion and resulting town evacuation which occurred in 2013. History=Settlement and early history Milford dates back to the 1850s, when several men from Cherokee County came to the Mill Creek valley and bought land at 50 cents an acre from Ellis County landowner Arvin Wright. Milford was named by William R. Hudson after the factory town of Milford, Massachusetts. During 1853 the first house, a combined residence and general store belonging to William R. Hudson, was built, along with a two-story schoolhouse which served as church and community hall until it burned during the Civil War. In 1854 Wright, Hudson, and J.M. Higgins laid out town lots atop a ridge. In 1857, a gristmill began operation at the community. Milford was incorporated in 1888, with W.R. McDaniel serving as the first mayor. In 1890, the tracks of the Dallas and Waco Railway (later acquired by the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad) reached the community, which became an important shipping point for area cotton farmers. By 1892 Milford had grown to a population of 800, and had three churches, a bank, a hotel, two cotton gins, and approximately two dozen other businesses, as well as a weekly newspaper. There were now two schools in Milford, Mollie Poe's private Lone Star Institute and the community-financed Milford Academy. In 1902 the Presbyterian Synod of Texas accepted the town's offer to open the Texas Presbyterian College for Girls in Milford, and by 1925 the Dallas-Waco electric interurban railway had reached the town.

Etymology Waxahachie, TX welcome sign Some sources state that the name means \\"cow\\" or \\"buffalo\\" in an unspecified Native American language. One possible Native American origin is the Alabama language, originally spoken in the area of Alabama around Waxahatchee Creek by the Alabama-Coushatta people, who had migrated by the 1850s to eastern Texas. In the Alabama language, waakasi hachi means \\"calf's tail\\" (the Alabama word waaka being a loan from Spanish vaca). That there is a Waxahatchee Creek near present-day Shelby, Alabama, suggests that Waxahachie, Texas, shares the same name etymology. Many place names in Texas and Oklahoma have their origins in the Southeastern United States, largely due to forced removal of various southeastern Indian tribes. The area in central Alabama that includes Waxahatchee Creek was for hundreds of years the home of the Upper Creek moiety of the Muscogee Creek Nation. Again, this would suggest a Muscogee Creek language origin of Waxahachie. \\"Waxahachie\\" therefore may be an anglicized pronunciation of the Muscogee compound word Wakvhvce from the Muscogee words Wakv (meaning \\"cow\\" derived from the Spanish vaca) and the Muscogee word Hvcce (meaning \\"river\\" or \\"creek\\").Many place names in the Southern U.S. end with \\"hatchee\\" or \\"hachie\\" such as, famously, \\"Tallahatchie Bridge\\". Whether \\"hatchee\\" or \\"hachie\\", these names oftentimes derive from either the Muscogee word hvce (tail) or hvcce (a river or a stream). For example, 'Tvlvhvcce (English \\"Tallahatchie\\") may be interpreted as \\"River City\\" from 'Tvlv (city or town) and \\"hvcce\\" (river or stream). A second etymology that has been suggested for the name is insisted on by speakers of Wichita, the language of the tribe which used to live in the area but now lives mostly around Anadarko, Oklahoma. Wichita people claim the name comes from their word waks'ahe:ts'i (the apostrophe represents a glottal stop, like the middle sound in \\"oh oh\\"; \\"a\\" is schwa (\\"uh\\"); \\"e:\\" sounds almost like the \\"a\\" of \\"hat\\"; \\"ts\\" before \\"i\\" in this language often sounds like \\"ch\\" to English speaking ears; \\"i\\" has the continental value, like the one in English \\"machine\\"). It means \\"fat wildcat\\".Dr. David S. Rood, linguist at the University of Colorado, who has been studying the Wichita language since 1965.
