The San Andreas, California, firm of Markwell and Sons built the house, covered in hand-cut shingles made by a brother of Thomas Flippin. The Flippin family occupied the home even before construction ended in 1900. Thomas Flippin had begun his lumber career as a skid greaser on a bull-team skid row, and the completion of his new home represented not only a perch above the town of Clatskanie but also a place above local society. The Flippins were not happy in their new home, and remained there only three years before vacating the house and ending their marriage. The house passed through several hands and served as an apartment building prior to being restored. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.  Description  Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of peer-mediated instruction where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error. The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring. A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately. At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team. CWPT has been used to help students learn spelling, math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, vocabulary, and facts related to an area of study. There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school. CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the University of Kansas.  Rationale  The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in active learning, and lets them receive immediate feedback. CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using social skills.  Evaluation of effectiveness = Research findings  CWPT has been effective for teaching spelling to both students in general education and students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mild intellectual disabilities, and learning disabilities. CWPT has helped improve the sight word retention and reading fluency of students with average school achievement, low school achievement, and learning disabilities. CWPT has also been shown to improve math fact fluency among students with and without disabilities, and it has increased the math achievement scores of middle school students with ADHD. There is also evidence that CWPT helps students of different ages learn facts, such as health and safety information, history material, and social studies concepts. CWPT has also been documented as having positive effects on the social skills and number of social interactions of students with mild disabilities and high functioning autism. There is also research demonstrating CWPT's effectiveness for teaching students of different ages and ability levels physical skills such as catching, striking a ball with a paddle, and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation skills.  Evaluation as an evidence-based practice  What Works Clearinghouse rating = The United States Department of Education's What Works Clearinghouse has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and English Language Learning (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a \\"potentially positive\\" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation. What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas. = Promising Practices Network rating = Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a \\"Proven Program\\". The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a \\"Proven Program\\" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 standard deviations, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful effect size, having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.  Criticisms  A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher- centered instruction or independent practice. Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.

This is a view of the front side of the main building. This plant was established by the British in India in 1931. Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant is one of the oldest hydroelectric power plants or hydel power stations in India. It is located at Sumera Dariyapur in Jawan Sikandarpur of Aligarh District, Uttar Pradesh,India. Approach This is a photograph of the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant. This is a view of the left side of the main building. Jawan Sikandarpur is situated on the Aligarh-Moradabad Highway (Anoopshahar Road) at a distance of 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Aligarh. It is 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from Qasimpur Power House Colony and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from Harduaganj Thermal Power Station. The building of the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant is situated just near the Highway where the Ganges Canal (or the Ganga Canal) flows under the Jawan Bridge (also spelled as Jawaa Bridge). History=Establishment of Jawan Sikandarpur and Sumera Dariyapur Raja Kulan Singh had three sons, Jauhar Singh, Sumer Singh and Tikam Singh. The elder son Jauhar Singh established Jawan Sikandarpur.Sumera Dariyapur was named after Sumer Singh. The origins and development of hydroelectric and thermal power systems in India This is a photograph of the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant. This is a view of the front side of the main building focussing on the name-plate. Most of the early power generating stations,(including Sumera) which were developed when India was a colony of the British, were hydro- electric in nature. These pre-independence generating stations fed loads in the urban areas and electrification of the villages was done mostly after 1947. Establishment of the power plant Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant was established by the British in 1931. The electricity generated from this plant was sufficient for the small population of Aligarh at that time. It is situated just near the Jawan Bridge. The building itself is a masterpiece of British architecture, combined with both beauty and strength. It was a small hydro plant. Its power capacity was 2,000 kW. A brief description of the building, location and date was written on a name-plate fixed high on the front elevation. (Shown in the 3rd photograph from the above). It reads as : \\"Ganges Canal Hydro-electrical Power Supply Sumera 1931\\" Water source and the construction of the dams The Ganges Canal (or the Ganga Canal) was used as a source of water for generating electricity. A dam was constructed on the Ganges Canal for the purpose. Another dam was also constructed near the Communical Health Centre. Therefore, the dams constructed on the Ganges Canal in Jawan Sikandarpur are as follows: (i)Jawan Dam was constructed near the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant to use the Ganges Canal as a source of water for generating electricity from the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant. Over the Jawan Dam, a bridge called as the Jawan Bridge was constructed, over which the Aligarh-Moradabad Highway passes now. (ii)Ganga Dam was constructed near the Communical Health Centre. Other power stations in or around Aligarh *Harduaganj Thermal Power Station in Aligarh. *NTPC Dadri in Dadri, Gautam Budh Nagar. *Palra Hydroelectric Power Plant in Bulandshahar. *Narora Atomic Power Station in Bulandshahar. *Faridabad Thermal Power Station in Faridabad. In total there are 13 power stations in Uttar Pradesh and 110 power stations in India. Upper Ganga Canal power projects There are 13 small waterfalls on the Upper Ganga Canal starting from Haridwar (where the Ganga enters the plains) to Aligarh. These power houses (along with their power capacity) are mentioned here: : (i) Bahadurabad (Bahadurabad and Salempur Waterfalls) (with the power capacity of 4,400 kW) : (ii) Pathari in Haridwar (2 lakh kW) : (iii) Mohammedpur in Haridwar (3,000 kW) : (iv) Nirgajni in Muzaffarnagar (5,000 kW) : (v) Chittora in Muzaffarnagar (3,000 kW) : (vi) Salawa in Meerut (3,000 kW) : (vii) Meerut (2,700 kW) : (viii) Palra in Bulandshahar (6,000 kW) : (ix) Sumera in Aligarh (2,000 kW) Most of the power energises tube-wells which irrigate 14 districts of Uttar Pradesh. The current status Currently the Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant is not operational. At present Sumera Hydroelectric Power Plant and Palra Hydroelectric Power Plant in Bulandshahar have both been abandoned.

Sound maps are created by associating landmarks (streets in a city, train stations, stores, pathways, factories, oil pumps, etc.) and soundscapes. The term ‚Äúsoundscape‚Äù refers to the sonic environment of a specific locale. It may also refer to actual environments, or to abstract constructions such as musical compositions and tape montages, particularly when considered as an artificial environment. The objective of sound maps is to represent a specific environment using its soundscape as primary references as opposed to visual cues. Sound maps are in many ways the most effective auditory archive of an environment. Sound maps are similar to sound walks which are a form of active participation in the soundscape. Soundwalks and indeed, sound maps encourage the participants to listen discriminatively, and moreover, to make critical judgments about the sounds heard and their contribution to the balance or imbalance of the sonic environment. However, soundwalks will plot out a route for the user to follow and give guidance as to what the user may be hearing at each checkpoint. Sound maps, on the other hand, have specific soundscapes recorded that users can listen to at each checkpoint.  History / Background  The theoretical framework upon which sound maps are based derive from earlier research on acoustic ecology and soundscapes, the later being a term first coined by researcher and music composer R. Murray Schafer in the 1960s. Looking to challenge traditional ideas of recording reality, Schafer, along with several college music composers such as Barry Truax and Hildegard Westerkamp, funded the World Soundscape Project, an ambitious sound recording project that led the team based in Simon Fraser University to travel within Canada and out in Europe to collect data on local soundscapes.Schafer, Raymond Murray (1977). The Tuning of the World. Random House Inc. The sounds that they recorded were used to build a database of locales not based on the visual, but on their acoustic particularities. The result of the project had been released to the public in the form of a series books entitled The Music of the Environment series which included narrative accounts of the soundscape recording activity (European Sound Diary) and soundscape analysis (Five Village Soundscapes). However, when those works were first published, the recordings were not available for the public to listen to as the project mainly aimed at building a database of sound over a long period of time. The World Soundscape Project also birthed major theoretical framework for future studies of acoustic ecology and soundscapes, among them R. Murray Schafer‚Äôs The Tuning of the World in which the idea of soundscape studies were first introduced as well as Barry Truax‚Äôs The World Soundscape Project's Handbook for Acoustic Ecology that presented the foundational terminology for research in the field. Sound maps make use of new computer locative technologies to achieve the similar purpose of preserving the soundscape of specific locales, but differs in the way of presenting the sound database. Through digital technologies such as mapping software and audio file encoding, the objective of using sound maps is partly that of making a soundscape database available to the public in a comprehensive fashion by uploading each site-specific soundscape onto a digital map as well as making the end product available for public collaboration. Users are able to pull up a map of the city and click on the sound clip icons in order to hear the soundscape for that location. Some sound maps are crowd-sourced and therefore allow the public to record their own soundscapes and upload them onto the digital map provided by the site hosting the sound map. Therefore, the soundscape database is built by the public and made available to the public for use.  Applications =The Sound Around You Project The Sound Around You project began as a soundscape research project at the University of Salford, UK in 2007. The project allows people across the world to use their iPhone (or any other audio recorder) to record clips or sonic postcards of around 30 seconds in length from different sound environments, or ‚Äòsoundscapes‚Äô from a family car journey to a busy shopping centre, and to upload them to the virtual map, along with their opinions of them and why they chose to record it. Sound Around You aims to raise awareness of how our soundscape influences us and could have far reaching implications for professions and social groups ranging from urban planners to house buyers. New York Sound Map The NYSoundmap is a project of The New York Society for Acoustic Ecology (NYSAE), a New York metropolitan chapter of the American Society for Acoustic Ecology, an organization dedicated to exploring the role of sound in natural habitats and human societies, and promoting public dialog concerning the identification, preservation, and restoration of natural and cultural sound environments. The NYSAE's purpose is to explore and create an ongoing dialog regarding aural experience specific to New York City. The NYSoundmap project is the direct result of the NYSAE's interest in collecting and disseminating the city's aural experiences to the general public. We are artists, architects, sound engineers, philosophers and designers. Our relationship to sound as a vital and key component of urban living is made manifest by our desire to create and share this map with and for friends, neighbors and fellow citizens of the city of New York. Through the NYSoundmap project, the NYSAE aims to facilitate a dialogue between people from a wide variety of communities and backgrounds - from beginners to professional sound artists and musicians. Stanley Park Soundmap The Stanley Park Soundmap is a web-based document of the sonic attributes of one of North America's largest urban parks located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Using a GPS unit, and a compact digital audio recorder 13 positions in the park were documented on a cool sunny day on Thursday, March 12, 2009. The location data and sound recordings were then linked to a map created in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based desktop application. Montreal Sound map The Montr√©al Sound Map is a web-based soundscape project that allows users to upload field recordings to a Google Map of Montr√©al. The soundscape is constantly changing, and this project acts as a sonic time capsule with the goal of preserving sounds before they disappear.  Sonoteca Bahia Blanca  Sonoteca Bahia Blanca is a virtual platform that aims to provide a common space for the collection, concentration, sharing and distribution of sound through its georeferencing and organization in a database, from a collaborative, supportive cultural practice and community status. The project seek to enhance the sound heritage of the city, to rediscover and disseminate it, as a means of its multiple identities. Sound Map: www.sonotecabahiablanca.com/mapa Sound map with the MOMA studio Sound and space are closely linked. Our ears help define our surroundings by picking up on spatial clues in reflected sound waves. This innate ability to situate ourselves in our soundscape was probably more overtly useful in the days before electricity, when we had to rely on our ears to alert us to danger our eyes could not detect. There is, however, a movement in the visually impaired community to cultivate this ability to help them navigate in the world and participate in sports, and artists such as Janet Cardiff use sound and spatiality as integral parts of their work (see The Forty Part Motet).  Significance / Importance  Sound maps give people a new way to look at geography and the world around them. They allow users to reconnect with their immediate environment which the current generation seldom does anymore (think about how often we see others with headphones in or on the phone instead of keeping their ears open). Sound maps also have a historical significance in that they will give future generations an idea of what a specific place sounded like, at a specific time. Indeed, as the Montreal Sound Map project pointed out: sound maps can be used as ‚Äúsonic time capsules‚Äù which preserve the sounds of a place before they disappear. Currently, we possess historical maps and pictures that can tell us how past societies lived. However, we have no idea what those societies sounded like. Sound maps give us an opportunity to have access to this vital historical significance.

Education and career Kimball was one of three siblings, born to a middle-class family in New Britain, Connecticut. His father was an executive for a household goods manufacturer, his mother was a former elementary school teacher, and his older brother George E. Kimball went on to become a noted quantum chemist and operations researcher who also taught at Columbia University. Kimball was named after his grandfather, Penn Townsend Kimball, who had moved from Massachusetts to Chicago; Kimball's family moved from Chicago to New Britain before he was born. Kimball went to Lawrenceville School, graduated from Princeton University in 1937, and spent a year at Balliol College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, earning a master's degree in politics and economics. He served in the Pacific as a Marine in World War II, becoming a captain. His journalism career began in New York during the 1940s. During that era, he worked for numerous magazines and newspapers including The New Republic and the New York Times. He was an aide to governors Chester Bowles of Connecticut and W. Averell Harriman of New York. While still studying for a doctorate at Columbia University, he was hired as a journalism professor there in 1958.. In the 1970s he worked with Edward Logue on urban renewal and wrote a report on the South Bronx, Areas of Strength, Areas of Opportunity. He was also an election consultant to the CBS network and a producer/writer for Omnibus. He retired from Columbia in 1985, after which he completed his a doctorate in political science from Columbia and became a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. Security file and legal case In 1977, after requesting his file under the Freedom of Information Act, Kimball discovered that the federal government had regarded him and his wife as a security risk on suspicion of Communist sympathies since the file was opened when he took the Foreign Service examination 30 years before, and that the information in his file was based on unsubstantiated anonymous reports. In 1984, Kimball filed a $10 million lawsuit against the federal government. His name was officially cleared in 1987 after the assistance of Senator Lowell P. Weicker of Connecticut and Kimball's agreement to drop the lawsuit. Books Kimball published several books, including *The Disconnected (Columbia University Press, 1973), about institutionalized exclusion of the minority poor from the U.S. electoral system. *The File (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1983) about his security file.

The operation (involving a shipment in 1983 and another in 1984, both at minimal charge to the US) was a precursor to the transfer of weapons to the Contras from other sources, in what became known as the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Overview Operation Tipped Kettle involved the transfer in 1983 of around 300 metric tons of captured arms and ammunition (worth around $10m, according to the US) in 34 Israeli Government-owned shipping containers, for a $100,000 payment covering handling costs. The transfer was based on talks between Richard Secord and Menachem Meron, the Israeli military attache in Washington, D.C., and was signed off by Israeli Minister of Defense Moshe Arens.Amir Oren, Haaretz, 26 November 2010, The truth about Israel, Iran and 1980s U.S. arms deals In the 1989 trial of Oliver North, it was stated that the US had \\"admitted for the purposes of this trial that\\" the matter had begun with a request from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Casey, to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, to ascertain whether the weapons captured by Israel could be obtained by the US.US v Oliver North Casey informed the US Congressional intelligence committees of the arms' acquisition, but not of their destination.William M. LeoGrande (2009), Our Own Backyard: The United States in Central America, 1977-1992, University of North Carolina Press, p387 A second shipment (requiring over 100 containers) was agreed in 1984, after the 1984 Israeli legislative election but before the new government took office, again signed off by Arens. Again the arms ($30-$40m worth) were donated by the Israelis, in return for an expectation of increased military assistance. A Pentagon investigation of a November 1986 complaint from Israel that this expectation had not been met revealed that \\"The Israeli military attache's office in Washington and the international branch of the Defense Department had reached a secret arrangement: In return for Israel waiving the payment, the U.S. defense contractor Numax was to retain its security clearance and government contracts after being purchased by Israel.\\" Numax Electronics Inc. had been acquired by Israel's Tadiran Electronic Industries in 1983; officially, Numax' classified work was protected by a special arrangement whereby all discussion and work on it would be limited to employees who were US nationals and had the appropriate security clearance.James O\`Shea and Douglas Frantz, Chicago Tribune, 17 November 1986, Israel Turns U.s.

Bavarian State Ministry for Environment and Health, Munich, 2012, p 21Terrestrial (ground-based or close-range) photogrammetry was one of the first successful methods for detecting and quantifying surface changes in rock glaciers. Flow velocity was a typical parameter derived from this. The 2D or even 3D kinematics of the rock glacier surface is needed for rheological models. In recent years, active rock glaciers have also become the focus of climate change research. Atmospheric warming is supposed to influence flow/creep velocity of rock glaciers, which can thus be seen as indicators of environmental change in mountainous regions. Melting of the subsurface ice causes surface lowering, which in the worst case may lead to active landsliding and even a total collapse of the rock glacier surface. [Kaufmann, V.

[Walther Hofmann Sebastian Finsterwalder, in: New German Biography Vol 5, pp. 166-167. ] He was a Bavarian mathematician and surveyor.Robert SAUER / Max KNEISSL: Sebastian Finsterwalder, in: Jahrbuch der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften f√ºr 1952, S. 200-204. [Robert SAUER / Max KNEISSL Sebastian Finsterwalder, in: Yearbook of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, 1952, pp. 200-204.] In 1892 he married Franziska Mallepell (d. 1953) from Brixen, South Tyrol. Their two sons worked in similar fields; Richard Finsterwalder (1899-1963), Professor at the Technical University in Hanover and Munich, and Ulrich Finsterwalder (1897-1988), a civil engineer. A keen mountaineer, Finsterwalder became interested, through the influence of his friend E. Richter, in alpine fossils as indicators of the geology and structure of the Alps and their glaciers. His desire for accurate, but also less costly, motion measurements on glaciers led him to glaciological applications of photogrammetry in geodesy.Albertz, J. (2010). 100 Years German Society for Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing, and Geoinformation. Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformatione.V., , 144 pp. In 1886, aged 24, he received his doctorate from the University of T√ºbingen, under the guidance of the algebraic geometer Alexander von Brill. Finsterwalder observed that Rudolf Sturm's analysis of the \\"homography problem\\" (1869) can be used to solve the problem of 3D-reconstruction using point matches in two images; which is the mathematical foundation of photogrammetry. Finsterwalder pioneered geodetic surveys in the high mountains. At the age of 27 years he conducted a first glacier mapping project at Vernagtferner in the √ñtztal Alps, Austria. Research and Applications of Photogrammetry Following the 1878 work of Italian engineer Pio PaganiniFinsterwalder remarked in 1890 that in Italy, thousands of square kilometres of alpine territory had already been photographically surveyed‚Äîwith hardly anyone taking notice in Germany. What astonished Finsterwalder most was the skill with which the topographers of the I.G.M. [Istituto Topografico Militare] transformed the photos into maps. Anyone with an interest in mapmaking \\"will absorb himself with greatest pleasure into the many details of this map and will never stop to admire the accuracy and fidelity with which everything is overheard from nature.\\" [Albertz, J., 2010. 100 Years German Society for Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing, and Geoinformation. Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformatione.V., , 144 pp.] and others,\\"Photogrammetry ‚Äì the art of making measurements using images ‚Äì is the task of determining an object or its dimensions using photographs. Preliminary work on this problem was done by Lambert in what he referred to as \\"inverting the perspective\\" and by Beautemps-Beaupre (1791-1793). In surveying these methods were first tested by A. Laussedat (1852-59). Starting in 1855 I. Porro began developing instruments for photogrammetry. A. Meydenbauer brought architectural photogrammetry to high level. W. Jordan17 and C. Koppe approached the problem from the standpoint of geodesy, and G. Hauck approached it from a theoretical point of view. Photogrammetry was practiced on a large scale in Italy by L. P. Paganini since 1880 and in Canada by E. Deville since 1889. S. Finsterwalder has been doing aerial photogrammetry from balloons since 1890. C. Pulfrich has been using stereoscopy since 1890. A. Laussedat has collected material on the history of photographic methods and equipment.\\" [Finsterwalder, S. (1906) Photogrammetrie. In: Encyklopcidie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluft ihrer Anwendungen. Band VI, Teil1, Geodcisie und Geophysik. Leipzig: B.G. Teubner 1906-1925. pp. 98-116.] Finstenwalder advanced methods for reconstruction and measurements of three- dimensional objects from photographic images. He was appointed professor at the Technical University of Munich in 1891, succeeding his teacher, A. Voss, at the Department of Analytical Geometry, Differential and Integral Calculus (remaining at the university for forty years until 1931). The next year, he married, and completed the first recording of the Bavarian glacier in Wettersteingebirge and the Berchtesgaden Alps. He applied the technique of plane table photogrammetry in addition to a conventional geodetic survey, assisted by the novel lightweight, accurate phototheodolite that he had developed for high-mountain applications. The device was based on the prototype phototheodolite developed by Albrecht Meydenbauer (1834-1921) for architectural applications. From 1890 Finsterwalder also employed aerial photography,Kneissl, M. (1942) Sebastian Finsterwalder zum 80. Geburtstag. Bildmessung und Luftbildwesen. 11, 53-64. reconstituting the topography of the area of Gars am Inn in 1899 from a pair of balloon photographs using mathematical calculations of many points in the images.Finsterwalder, S.: Eine Grundaufgabe der Photogrammetrie und ihre Anwendung auf Ballonaufnahmen. Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., 2. Abt. 22, 225-260 (1903). In 1897 Finsterwalder addressed the German Mathematical Society, and he described some of the results of projective geometry he was applying to photogrammetry.Finsterwalder, S. (1897) Die geometrischen Grundlagen der Photogrammetrie. Jahresber deutsch Math-Verein. 6 (2), 1-41 His theory of large triangle meshes became known as the \\"Finsterwaldersche fields method\\" (1915). His analytical approach was laborious however, prompting development of analogue instrumentation with stereo measurement permitting faster optical/mechanical reconstruction of the photographic data arrays to determine object points.Konecny, G. (2002) Geoinformation: Remote Sensing, Photogrammetry and Geographic Information Systems. CRC Press. p.9 This was assisted by new technology; Carl Pulfrich's stereocomparator (1901) and Eduard Ritter von Orel's stereoautograph (1907), both instruments built by the company Carl Zeiss.Finsterwalder was doctoral advisor to Heinrich Erfle (1884‚Äì1923) a German optician who spent most of his career at Carl Zeiss. In 1911 he took over the chair of descriptive geometry, turning down offers of appointment from Vienna, Berlin and Potsdam.  Aerodynamics  Felix Klein commissioned Finsterwalder while the latter was professor of mathematics at the Munich polytechnic, to write on aerodynamics for his Enzyklop√§die der mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss ihrer Anwendungen (EMW) (tr. 'Encyclopedia of mathematical sciences including their applications'). The article, which he submitted in August 1902, more than a year before the Wrights achieved powered flight is thus prescient in its insights into the mathematics behind this new field of engineering. Finsterwalder also worked with Martin Kutta (1867-1944) at the Institute in Munich to devise formulas relating to the lift on an aerofoil in terms of the circulation round it. Kutta's habilitation thesis, completed in the same year, 1902, with which Finsterwalder assisted, contains the Kutta-Joukowski theorem giving the lift on an aerofoil. Glacier Flow in the √ñtztal Alps In 1922 Finsterwalder mapped the topography of the √ñtztal AlpsThese Alps are the location in which '√ñtzi the Iceman' was found; a well-preserved natural mummy of a man who lived about 3,300 BCE focusing on two glaciers, i.e. Gepatschferner and Wei√üseeferner, using stereophotogrammetry.Finsterwalder, S., (1928) Geleitworte zur Karte des Gepatschferners. Zeitschrift f√ºr Gletscherkunde, 16, 20-41. During this work he discovered √ñlgruben rock glacier and the rock glacier north of Krummgampenspitze. √ñstliche Krummgampenspitze 3090 m 10135 ft. In 1923 and 1924 Finsterwalder measured a flow velocity profile across √ñlgruben rock glacier.Finsterwalder, S., (1928) Geleitworte zur Karte des Gepatschferners.

Various links are mentioned between the Abbasid Caliphate and Tang dynasty, China. However, it is now believed that Buzurg is probably a purely fictional personage. Apart from the attribution of this book to him, his existence is otherwise unattested. The attribution apparently dates from the thirteenth century, long after he allegedly lived.

She was launched in 1808 and had an almost completely uneventful career until she was sold in 1815. She then became a merchantman trading with the West Indies and the Mediterranean. She was last listed in 1823. Career The Times reported on 14 May 1808 that \\"the Crocus, a beautiful brig of 18 guns, built by the apprentices of this port [Plymouth]\\", would be launched on 25 May.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 17 May 1808: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 10 Jan. 2018.] She was actually launched a few weeks later. Commander Robert Merrick Fowler commissioned Crocus in August for the North Sea. On 19 February 1809, Crocus, , and the brig-sloop were in company when Rolla recaptured the American ship Factor. Factor, of New York, Johnstone, master, had been sailing from Tenerife when the privateer captured her the day before between Beachy Head and Dungeness. The British sent her into Dover. The same privateer had also captured a brig, which the excise cutter Lively had recaptured and sent into the Downs.LL 21 February 1809, ‚Ññ429. Crocus participated in the ill-fated Walcheren Campaign.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, pp.384-5. Starting on 30 July 1809, a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren. However, the French fleet had left Flushing (Vlissingen) and sailed to Antwerp, and the British lost over 4,000 men to \\"Walcheren Fever\\", a combination of malaria and typhus, and to enemy action. As the strategic reasons for the campaign dissipated and conditions worsened, the British force withdrew in December. Prize money arising from the net proceeds of the property captured at Walcheren and the adjacent islands in the Scheld was paid in October 1812. Fowler transferred to on 18 September 1809. Commander the Honourable William Walpole recommissioned Crocus in October. She then cruised the Channel. Three months later Commander Richard Buck replaced him. Buck sailed her for the Mediterranean on 19 December. On 19 January 1810, Crocus recaptured Selberen. By 11 June Crocus was back in Britain as on the 11th a midshipman from Crocus underwent court martial on board in the Hamoaze. The charge was that he had deserted while Crocus was off Land's End when he had been sent with a boat's crew to retrieve sand for scrubbing the deck. The court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment in the Marshalsea, to be mulcted of all his pay, to be declared unworthy and incapable of ever serving as an officer in his Majesty's navy and, at the expiration of his imprisonment, to serve before the mast.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, p.82. The court ordered a seaman who had also seized the same opportunity to desert to 200 lashes. The seaman had made mutinous statements to the purser and First Lieutenant on Crocus when they caught him. Crocus captured Triton, Thompson, master, in early January 1810. Triton had been sailing from New York to Tonningen before Crocus sent her into Plymouth.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4421. Serbere, Tamansin, master, arrived at Falmouth on 20 January 1810. She had been sailing from Alicante to London when a 10-gun French privateer had captured her on the 18th.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4425. Then in May Crocus escorted to Portsmouth , which had been serving as a guardship at Falmouth.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 8 May 1810: 4. The Times Digital Archive.

While Crocus was in Portsmouth, a 16-year-old Marine fell overboard on 14 November. His floating body was immediately retrieved but efforts to revive him failed.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 24, p.440. Although Bellamy had recommissioned Crocus, this apparently occurred while Buck was on leave. Buck remained in command until he was promoted to post captain on 3 April 1811.Marshall (1828), Supplement, Part 2, pp.350-1. Commander Arden Adderley assumed command in May 1811 and recommissioned her in September. On 3 February 1812 Powhattan, Parrott, master, arrived at Malta. She had been sailing from New York when Crocus detained her.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4659. On 4 September Crocus captured the French privateer settee Formica, of two guns and 25 men. She was three months out of Genoa but had not made any captures. Her crew escaped in the boats to the Barbary shore. Later prize money reports gave the privateer's name as Fournie and the head-money count as 36 men. On 2 January 1813, Crocus and captured San Nicolo. Powhattan, Parrott, master, arrived at Malta on 3 February 1814. She was from New York and Crocus had detained her off Cagliari.Lloyd's List 9 January 1810 - accessed 13 November 2013. Adderley received promotion to post captain on 19 July 1814.Marshall (1829), supplement, Part 3, p.309. However, on 7 June 1814 James Hanway Plumridge was promoted to commander in Crocus, but within a month was transferred to command of . Commander John Stoddard then recommissioned her in July. Disposal: Crocus was paid off in November 1814. The Admiralty then listed her for sale at Sheerness on 9 February 1815. She finally sold on 31 August for ¬£830. Crocus Crocus became a merchantman.

Recently, Briggs announced his retirement from the California Highway Patrol to focus his efforts on suicide prevention. Biography Briggs originally applied to the California Highway Patrol for employment when his friend applied and he wanted to see what it was about. In 1994 he began patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge, estimating that he had dissuaded roughly two per month from committing suicide. Two people did jump after his intercession. In 2003, Briggs described a typical conversation -- starting by asking how the person is doing, then asking their plans for the following day. He would ask \\"are you here to hurt yourself?\\" If they did not have plans for the next day, he'd try to make plans with them, inviting them to come back to the bridge if their plan did not work out at the end of the day. In May 2013, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention recognized the California Highway Patrol with a public service award in suicide prevention. Briggs accepted the award on behalf of the California Highway Patrol. In November 2013, NBC News chronicled Briggs and reported on his impending retirement. After his retirement from the California Highway Patrol, he plans on focusing his work on suicide prevention. He is also a veteran of the United States Army.

EMU depot, .. E.M.U.D, .. Traction Maintenance Depot (TMD) etc is an electric multiple unit maintenance depot located on the Midland Main Line in the Cauldwell district of Bedford. A four road maintenance depot opened in 2004 to service trains, and was extended to a fifth road in 2009. The depot is set to lose its maintenance facilities in 2017 for conversion to 12 car sidings for Class 700 rolling stock.

History The site has been historically undeveloped for housing or industrial buildings; from the during the second half of the 19th century a tramway (siding) running from the London to Bedford line accessed the site; the site remained occupied by rail sidings throughout the 20th century.Ordnance Survey. 1:10560, 1902, 1927, 1938, 1960; 1:10000, 1972, 1980, 1987-9 In the early 2000s the construction of phase 2 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link required a 25-week closure of the railway line between King's Cross and Kentish Town; this blockade would prevent easy access of trains of the London-Bedford line to their traditional servicing facilities at Selhurst depot in south London. As a result, Railtrack calculated it would be cost effective to construct a depot at Bedford to service the trains, and for future use, including as a depot for the Thameslink Programme expansion. The sidings at Bedford station were to be retained for storing trains. Fitzpatrick contractors Ltd. was given a ¬£11 million contract to build a four road train shed for the Class 319 EMUs, which in addition to the construction of the main train service and maintenance building included stabling for 22 four car trains, a train wash, and controlled emission toilet servicing.

The ship was subsequently torpedoed and sunk in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea by a German U-boat during the First World War. Description The SS Orteric was built by Russell & Company of Port Glasgow in the Firth of Clyde shipyards as a 6,535 gross tons cargo ship that was long with a beam of , and a triple expansion engine built by Rankin and Blackmore of Greenock that gave her a cruising speed of 13 knots. The ship was launched on 19 December 1910 by owner Andrew Weir of Glasgow for cargo and passenger service in his various transport companies, including the Bank Line, Inver Transport & Trading Co. Immigrant ship The Orteric is historically significant because on one of her early voyages in 1911 she brought 960 Spanish and 565 Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii to work as contract labor in the sugar cane plantations. This made her the last ship to participate in the Portuguese immigration to Hawaii of 1878-1911, and the second ship to participate in the Spanish immigration that followed. The Spanish immigrants, who were mostly from the area of Seville, boarded the ship at Gibraltar, and the Portuguese boarded at Oporto and Lisbon, Portugal. They left Gibraltar on 24 February 1911 and arrived on 12 April 1911 in Hawaii after 48 days at sea. Hawaiian newspapers reported that the two groups argued and fought with each other during the long voyage, \\"so much so that they had to be separated. The women . . . went as far as hair pulling.\\" There was also an outbreak of measles during the voyage that resulted in 58 deaths, most of them children. Sinking during World War I Orteric made several voyages across the Atlantic until she was torpedoed and sunk by German U-boat SM U-39 on 9 December 1915 in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea about 140 miles southeast of the island of Gavdos. The ship was hauling 10,000 tons of sodium nitrate from Antofagasta, Chile, to Alexandria, Egypt when the submarine was spotted. The captain of Orteric tried evasive maneuvers, but the U-boat was commanded by Captain Walter Forstmann, one of the most skillful and deadliest U-boat commanders of the war. When it became evident that escape was impossible, a white flag of surrender was hoisted over Orteric, but the U-boat fired torpedoes anyway, sinking the ship, and killing two Chinese sailors on board. Captain Forstmann subsequently detained the lifeboat with the captain of Orteric long enough to force the latter to sign a German document, then set him adrift. A few hours later three lifeboats with the survivors of Orteric were rescued by a British hospital ship.

Zahles Skole) is a private school located on N√∏rre Voldgade in Copenhagen, Denmark. Named after its founder, Natalie Zahle (1827‚Äì1913), it now consists of two independently run primary schools and a Gymnasium. History On 1 May 1851, Natalie Zahle launched a programme for the training of female private teachers. It developed into a proper School of education in 1861 after women had been given access to teach at Danish public schools in 1859. The gymnasium traces its history back to a programme that was introduced in 1877. The primary school now known as N. Zahles Seminarieskole was founded in 1895 as a preparatory school for the teachers college. The schools were opened to boys in the 1950s. The teachers' college was disjoined from the institution in 2002 and is now part of University College of Copenhagen. The school's first home was a small apartment in the no longer existing street Hummergade. It later moved to larger premises on Gammel Strand and finally to a new building on N√∏rre Voldgade in 1877. The school later took over several of the neighbouring buildings. N.

Synergistic catalysis is a specialized approach to catalysis whereby at least two different catalysts act on two different substrates simultaneously to allow reaction between the two activated materials. While a catalyst works to lower the energy of reaction overall, a reaction using synergistic catalysts work together to increase the energy level of HOMO of one of the molecules and lower the LUMO of another. While this concept has come to be important in developing synthetic pathways, this strategy is commonly found in biological systems as well. Background Synergistic catalysts have been used for a variety of reactions, especially when both substrates require some kind of significant activation either with stoichiometric amounts of an activator or through a separate reaction beforehand. Synergistic catalysts differ from other multi-catalyst systems by the nature that one catalyst activates one substrate while the other activates a different substrate. There are other types of multi-catalyst systems such as double activation catalysts where two catalysts are required to activate one substrate or cascade catalysts where one catalyst first transforms a substrate which then is activated by a second catalyst to react. Classification of multicatalyst mechanism While this field does show particular promise in affording molecules that could not be synthesized under normal synthetic strategies, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. One such issue is self quenching of the catalysts with each other. An example is if one of the catalysts is a Lewis acid and the other is a Lewis base, there is the possibility for formation of a Lewis acid base complex but this can be overcome by carefully choosing the pair. Examples=In Biology Synergistic catalysts are very common in biological systems. The reactions occur by a molecule binding to a protein as a substrate and becoming active and being reacted with a coenzyme such as NADPH which is essentially an activated hydride. A specific example of this is shown by the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate via the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Dihydrofolate reductase catalytically activates dihydrofolate by protonating the imine, while NADPH, essentially a hydride source activated by the cofactor NADP+, can then come in and add a hydride across the imine to afford the product. example of synergistic catalysis in biology Dual Transition Metals Catalysis Through the combination of two transition metal catalysts, synergistic catalysis has been reported to accelerate many chemical transformations, and even to induce high enantioselectivity, which could not be realized by the use individual catalysts. Sawamura et al. reported an early example of enantioselective allylic alkylation of nitriles catalyzed by a mixture of rhodium and palladium complexes. The palladium catalyst with chiral ligands alone gave a high yield, but no enantioselectivity was observed. The reaction did not proceed at all using the rhodium catalyst alone. Using both together, however, gave both a high yield and enantioselectivity for the transformation. Synergistic catalysis developed by Sawamura et al. They used trans-chelating chiral phosphine ligands (AnisTRAP) to generate chiral transition metal complexes. In their proposed mechanism schemes, an enolate is formed from an Œ±-cyano ester and coordinates to the rhodium catalyst, while decarboxylative and oxidative addition of allyl carbonate to the palladium catalyst forms the œÄ-allylpalladium (II) complex. Subsequently, the enolate attacks the œÄ-allylpalladium (II) complex enantioselectively to afford the optically active product. Dual transition metals catalytic cycles proposed by Sawamura et al. Enantio- and Diastereoselective Catalysis Besides using two transition metal catalysts, synergistic catalysis can also be carried out by utilizing one transition metal catalyst in combination with an organocatalyst. Here the synergistic Œ±-allylation of aldehydes was accomplished by utilizing a transition metal complex in combination with a chiral amine catalyst. In 2013, Carreira and co-workers reported a highly enantio- and diastereoselective Œ±-allylation of branched aldehydes. They used chiral primary amines and iridium catalysts complexed with chiral ligands to afford the product with two newly formed stereocenters at the Œ± and Œ≤ position. Dual catalysis developed by Krautwald et al. By matching the two chiral amines and enantiomers of the chiral ligands, they were able to access all four possible stereoisomers of the product with good yields. More importantly, their catalytic system exhibits simultaneous and almost absolute control over the stereochemical configurations of both stereocenters.

Plot=Opening Sequence The Storybrooke Clocktower. In Storybrooke As the mission begins in Neverland, Gold and Regina give Ariel instructions to contact Belle once she arrives in Storybrooke to retrieve an item that will be useful in their quest to destroy Peter Pan. Regina also gives her a bracelet that she can use for only 24 hours in order to complete her mission and Gold gives her an enchanted sand dollar, instructing her to give it to Belle as she'll know what it means.

Going back five days earlier as Emma Swan, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Gold, and Hook left for Neverland to search for Henry, Gold tells Belle that the prophecy will be his undoing and he might not be coming back, but Belle believes in her heart that he will return. Gold also gave her instructions to use a cloaking spell because there might be others coming from the outside world to destroy Storybrooke, and after alerting the residents of the threat, she places the spell around the city limits by opening a vein of fairy dust in the mines; however, a pair of brothers arriving from Minnesota in a convertible managed to sneak in just in time, as they are revealed to be the contacts from Peter Pan's Home Office. Five days later, the seven dwarfs are having lunch by the beach talking about how quiet it has been since Regina, Snow and Charming have left and no killings have occurred, when Leroy witnesses Ariel emerging from the ocean. She tells Leroy that she was sent on a mission from Neverland to contact Belle and retrieve an item that's stored in Gold's pawn shop. Unfortunately, this exchange is being watched from afar as the brothers are given their orders to make sure that Ariel never makes it back to Neverland with the item. After Leroy brings Ariel to Belle at Granny's Diner, the two head back to the pawn shop, where the sand dollar is activated. A projection of Gold tells Belle that their love is the only way they can defeat Peter Pan. Belle believes that can be found in the only item that symbolizes their true love, the chipped tea cup, as magic can be put in its proper spot. Belle discovers that the spot is Pandora's Box, which contains the world's darkest evils and can be used to defeat Pan. But before they can prepare to bring it back to Gold, the brothers succeed in stealing the item. The brothers escape, leaving Belle and Ariel tied up. Belle and Ariel however break free by using Ariel's fins and learn that the only way to destroy the item is by using the pickaxe in the mines, so she and Ariel race to the mines, where just as they are about to destroy the box, Belle uses a cart to knock the brothers out and stops them cold in going through with their plan. The brothers then plead with Belle that they are not interested in destroying magic: they want to use the box so they can rescue their sister, Wendy, who has been a prisoner of Peter Pan for over a century. They then reveal themselves as her brothers, Michael and John Darling. Belle tells the brothers that the box will be the only way to stop Pan and free their sister. Ariel then takes the box back to Neverland and gives it to Gold. Regina then rewards her by giving her the ability to walk on land, allowing her to continue her search for Eric. Ariel also tells Gold that Wendy is also a captive of Pan's and that they should save her too. As Ariel leaves, Gold tells her to send a message to Belle that he will return. In Neverland While one plan to destroy Pan is placed in motion, another is being plotted inside Neverland, as Neal reveals to Emma and Hook that the coconut shell that showcases the stars in the cave he used to live in is also how they can capture Pan's shadow, which was how Neal escaped Neverland in the past. He knows where to find one, which is revealed to be Dark Hollow, the darkest place on the island, where the plan is to capture Pan's shadow by drawing it to the flame inside the shell. However, Mary Margaret is concerned that the reason why Neal and Hook are going along with Emma is both men might have feelings for Emma. As the trio leaves to the location, Emma is impressed by Hook becoming more of an ally, but he also tells Emma that sooner or later she'll have to choose between him and Neal. They retrieve the coconut shell in Neal's old cave, where Hook reveals to Neal that he and Emma kissed. When they reach the destination, the trio starts to light up the candle inside the shell to attract them, only to have the two men fight each other over who'll light it and as expected, over Emma. However, the plan backfires as two shadows attack Neal and Hook, but Emma eventually springs into action by using magic to light the shell and it attracts Pan's shadow to the trap, prompting Emma to capture it successfully, and allowing Neal and Hook to be free from the shadows. Unfortunately, Emma is not happy with how both Neal and Hook are behaving around her, prompting her to read the riot act to the two men, making it clear to them that the most important male in her live will always be Henry. Moments later after Emma, Hook, and Neal leave, while en route to Tinker Bell's hideout, Mary Margaret expresses her issues with David by giving him the silent treatment because his lied to her about being poisoned by the Dreamshade and will not be able to leave Neverland. David tells Mary Margaret that he did not want her to be trapped in Neverland forever, but Mary Margaret tells David that she would gladly spend her life in tree houses and dodging darts if it means being with him. The two then stop fighting and hug each other. The five members then arrive at Tinker Bell's, where Tinker Bell sees Neal for the first time since his escape and he shows proof of the captured shadow, which now gives the regrouped individuals the advantage needed to rescue Henry. Meanwhile, at Pan's camp, Henry begins to start doubting Pan, who visits one of the cages to check on and then release a prisoner, who is revealed to be Wendy, whom Pan wants to have to come out and play. As Pan tells Felix to go to another part of the island, Henry secretly follows Felix, leading Henry to a location where he discovers Wendy in bed, claiming that she is sick; she tells Henry that the powers on this island are fading fast, which is affecting her. Henry vows that he will save her and promises that he will come back for help, not knowing that Wendy was being used as bait by Pan, who emerges from hiding to congratulate her on convincing Henry to believe in Pan again before sending Wendy back to the cage. Pan, feigning surprise, meets Henry on his way back, who confronts him about Wendy and the fading magic. Seeing this as an opportunity to let Henry believe that he can save Wendy, he shows Henry Skull Rock, stating that that is where he needs to go to save magic. A determined Henry accepts the challenge. Cultural references A Star Wars allusion was used when Gold asked Belle for her help when the sand dollar beamed a hologram image of him. Also, Leroy tells the dwarfs \\"No time for whistling, boys\\", making a reference to \\"Whistle While You Work\\" from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ariel's entry into the present day for the first time and being intrigued by what she sees while seeking out Belle parallels a similar scene from the 1984 film Splash. Michael Darling/Keychain has a teddy bear on his rear view mirror, a reference to the teddy bear that he had in Peter Pan. Ariel says \\"Look at this stuff\\" in Mr. Gold's shop, which is the first sentence in the song 'Part of your World' from The Little Mermaid. There is also a reference to the movie The Neverending Story in where Wendy lies to Henry on behalf of Pan claiming that because magic is dying so is she. She is connected to its fate so to speak. In the Neverending Story the Empress too is dying because of lack of faith and belief in the human world, and that it would take Bastion to save her. Pan convinces Henry it's up to him to save Wendy. Production Guy Ferland directed this episode, with Kalinda Vazquez and Andrew Chambliss sharing writing duties. Reception=Ratings After a two-week increase in the ratings, the episode posted a 2.1/5 among 18-49s, with 6.71 million viewers tuning in. On this night with the exception of NFL Football, a majority of Sunday night programming were also down across the board as well. Critical reception The episode received positive reviews from critics, starting with Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly who commented positively on the episode's pace and change of scenery, saying \\"After weeks of running in place, tonight's episode felt pretty action-packed from start to finish. What's more, it actually advanced season 3's master plot. Thanks to the events of \\"Dark Hollow,\\" Rumpel and Regina have secured a tool that can defeat Pan; the MBC has secured a way to leave Never Land; and Pan has secured the help of Henry, who's been tricked into finally helping the ageless boy save Never Land's magic‚Äîor whatever Pan is actually using Henry to do. What's more, Ariel got legs, Belle got a renewed sense of hope, and we got a peak inside Pan's other bamboo box. (Welcome to the game, Wendy!)\\" Alyse Whitney of Wetpaint also gave the episode a positive review, saying \\"this was a great character-driven episode, and though Snow and Charming‚Äôs feuding didn‚Äôt do much, it all led to working with Tinker Bell again, and we‚Äôll see them storm Pan‚Äôs camp next week. Considering that Henry finally gave in and is embarking on his own journey to Skull Rock, who knows what will happen, but at least we have the hope that our favorite pairings will be reunited, right?\\" Amy Ratcliffe of IGN gave the episode a 7.7 out of 10, signaling generally positive reviews, saying \\"Tonight's return to Storybrooke was needed both for the change of setting and the comfort of seeing familiar faces. The delivery felt clunky, but we had some fun scenes with Ariel and Belle and the return of the Darlings was an enjoyable surprise. The characters on the island had some moments, especially Hook, but it looks like the real action will happen next week.\\" She also commented highly on Ariel's return, saying \\"JoAnna Garcia continues to be a bright spot as Ariel and she and Belle working together could kill audiences with adorableness. Ariel hits the exact innocent note you'd expect, making me just want to pinch her cheeks repeatedly. Her optimism and spunk is infectious. Plus, Ariel pairs well with Belle - both as actors and as characters;\\" though was a little more critical on the episode's effects, saying \\" the effects in \\"Dark Hollow\\" weren't bad. The red lighting effectively communicated the creepy vibe, and the shadows looked menacing. The creatures were a little rough around the edges but only a bit. And since they're fantasy shadows, it worked okay. Since this episode only had a few of the horrible digital backgrounds, it gets extra points from me.\\" Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B-, signaling moderate reviews, and commenting positively on the Storybrooke subplot, saying > Joanna Garcia Swisher continues her delightful portrayal as the slightly > clueless Ariel, and the adventure-minded Belle (Emilie de Ravin) proves > herself to be a good choice as Rumplestiltskin‚Äôs girlfriend: Just this week > she has to perform a cloaking spell, find Pandora‚Äôs box, and get held up by > fugitives from the Darling family. It‚Äôs nice to see Storybrooke again (we > get to see some daylight!), even though our neighbors are now limited to > Jiminy Cricket, the Blue Fairy, Grandma, and the dwarves.

The John and Michael reveal is a > welcome surprise, especially since it leads to a reappearance of Freya > Tingley as Wendy, who was so entrancing in her scenes with the young Bae > last season. She was, however, more critical of the events in Neverland, specifically on the love triangle between Emma, Hook, and Neal, saying \\"I had higher hopes for this triangle, especially considering Neal‚Äôs time on Hook‚Äôs ship when he was a boy, but it has descended into an extremely trite storyline not even soap- worthy.\\" She also commented negatively on the season's pace, saying \\"I‚Äôm almost feeling as dragged along as Henry is. OUAT is past the point of needing to bring the Save Henry saga to a close. Let‚Äôs hope next week leads to a showdown of sorts: More action, less traipsing through the neverending island greenery.\\" Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5, stating that \\"I found Ariel a lot more fun this week. Perhaps it was the fish out of water scenario she personified,\\" but then added \\"My biggest complaint about the entire episode was that there was so little Regina, but that didn't stop her presence from being felt. Her teaching skills already have Emma starting fires in the middle of windstorms. There's no telling how powerful these two women could be if they ever truly teamed up.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 3) episodes ","title":"Dark Hollow (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"41046025","text":"The 2005‚Äì06 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team represented the University of Louisville in the 2005-06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

Metal-catalyzed C‚ÄìH borylation reactions utilize transition metals to directly convert a C‚ÄìH bond into a C‚ÄìB bond. This route can be advantageous compared to traditional borylation reactions by making use of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon starting material, limiting prefunctionalized organic compounds, reducing toxic byproducts, and streamlining the synthesis of biologically important molecules.Ishiyama, T.; Nobuta, Y.; Hartwig, J. F.; Miyaura, N. Chem. Commun. 2003, 2924. Boronic acids, and boronic esters are common boryl groups incorporated into organic molecules through borylation reactions.Brown, H. C.; Kramer, G. W.; Levy, A. B.; Midland, M. M. Organic Synthesis via Boranes; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1975; Vol. 1. Boronic acids are trivalent boron-containing organic compounds that possess one alkyl substituent and two hydroxyl groups. Similarly, boronic esters possess one alkyl substituent and two ester groups. Boronic acids and esters are classified depending on the type of carbon group (R) directly bonded to boron, for example alkyl-, alkenyl-, alkynyl-, and aryl-boronic esters. The most common type of starting materials that incorporate boronic esters into organic compounds for transition metal catalyzed borylation reactions have the general formula (RO)2B-B(OR)2. For example, bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2), and bis(catecholato)diborane (B2Cat2) are common boron sources of this general formula. B2pin2 and B2cat2 The boron atom of a boronic ester or acid is sp2 hybridized possessing a vacant p orbital, enabling these groups to act as Lewis acids. The C‚ÄìB bond of boronic acids and esters are slightly longer than typical C‚ÄìC single bonds with a range of 1.55-1.59 √Ö. The lengthened C‚ÄìB bond relative to the C‚ÄìC bond results in a bond energy that is also slightly less than that of C‚ÄìC bonds (323 kJ/mol for C‚ÄìB vs 358 kJ/mol for C‚ÄìC).Hall, D. G. (2011) Structure, Properties, and Preparation of Boronic Acid Derivatives, in Boronic Acids: Preparation and Applications in Organic Synthesis, Medicine and Materials (Volume 1 and 2), Second Edition (ed D. G. Hall), Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, Germany. The carbon‚Äìhydrogen bond has a bond length of about 1.09 √Ö, and a bond energy of about 413 kJ/mol. The C‚ÄìB bond is therefore a useful intermediate as a bond that replaces a typically unreactive C‚ÄìH bond. Organoboron compounds are organic compounds containing a carbon-boron bond. Organoboron compounds have broad applications for chemical synthesis because the C‚ÄìB bond can easily be converted into a C‚ÄìX (X = Br, Cl), C‚ÄìO, C‚ÄìN, or C‚ÄìC bond. Because of the versatility of the C‚ÄìB bond numerous processes have been developed to incorporate them into organic compounds. Organoboron compounds are traditionally synthesized from Grignard reagents through hydroboration, or diboration reactions.Wade, L. G., Organic Chemistry. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, Inc., 2010. Borylation provides an alternative. Metal- catalyzed C‚ÄìH borylation reactions=Aliphatic C‚ÄìH borylation As first described by Hartwig, alkanes can be selectively borylated with high selectivity for the primary C‚ÄìH bond using Cp*Rh(Œ∑4-C6Me6) as the catalyst. Notably, selectivity for the primary C‚ÄìH bond is exclusive even in the presence of heteroatoms in the carbon-hydrogen chain. The rhodium-catalyzed borylation of methyl C‚ÄìH bonds occurs selectively without a dependence on the position of the heteroatom. Borylation occurs selectively at the least sterically hindered and least electron rich primary C‚ÄìH bond in a range of acetals, ethers, amines, and alkyl fluorides. Additionally, no reaction is shown to occur in the absence of primary C‚ÄìH bonds, for example when cyclohexane is the substrate. Aliphatic C‚ÄìH borylation Selective functionalization of a primary alkane bond is due to the formation of a kinetically and thermodynamically favorable primary alkyl-metal complex over formation of a secondary alkyl-metal complex. Primary versus secondary metal-alkyl complex The greater stability of primary versus secondary alkyl complexes can be attributed to several factors. First, the primary alkyl complex is favored sterically over the secondary alkyl complex. Second, partial negative charges are often present on the Œ±-carbon of a metal-alkyl complex and a primary alkyl ligand supports a partial negative charge better than a secondary alkyl ligand. The origin of selectivity for aliphatic C‚ÄìH borylation using rhodium catalysts was probed using a type of mechanistic study called hydrogen‚Äìdeuterium exchange. H/D exchanged showed that regioselectivity of the overall process shown below results from selective cleavage of primary over secondary C‚ÄìH bonds and selective functionalization of the primary metal-alkyl intermediate over the secondary metal-alkyl intermediate. Mechanistic pathways for aliphatic C‚ÄìH borylation The synthetic utility of aliphatic C‚ÄìH borylation has been applied to the modification of polymers through borylation followed by oxidation to form hydroxyl- functionalized polymers. C‚ÄìH borylation of polyolefins Aromatic C‚ÄìH borylationSteric directed C‚ÄìH borylation of arenes= The first example of a catalytic C‚ÄìH borylation of an unactivated hydrocarbon (benzene) was reported by Smith and Iverson using Ir(Cp*)(H)(Bpin) as the catalyst. The efficiency of this system, however, was low, providing only 3 turnovers after 120 h at 150 ¬∞C. Numerous subsequent developments by Hartwig and coworkers led to efficient, practical conditions for arene borylation. Aromatic C‚ÄìH borylation was developed by Hartwig and Ishiyama using the diboron reagent Bis(pinacolato)diboron catalyzed by 4,4‚Äô-di-tert-butylbipyridine (dtbpy) and [Ir(COD)(OMe)]2. With this catalyst system the borylation of aromatic C‚ÄìH bonds occurs with regioselectivity that is controlled by steric effects of the starting arene. The selectivity for functionalization of aromatic C‚ÄìH bonds is governed by the general rule that the reaction does not occur ortho to a substituent when a C‚ÄìH bond lacking an ortho substituent is available. When only one functional group is present borylation occurs in the meta and para position in statistical ratios of 2:1 (meta:para). The ortho isomer is not detected due to the steric effects of the substituent. Meta-para borylation Addition of Bpin occurs in only one position for symmetrically substituted 1,2- and 1,4-substituted arenes. Symmetrical or unsymmetrical 1,3-substituted arenes are also selectively borylated because only one C‚ÄìH bond is sterically accessible. Steric-directing iridium-catalyzed C‚ÄìH borylation This is in contrast to Electrophilic aromatic substitution where regioselectivity is governed by electronic effects.Liskey, C. Iridium- Catalyzed Borylation of Aromatic and Aliphatic C‚ÄìH bonds: Methodology and Mechanism. Dissertation, University of Illinois. Urbanan-Champaign. 2013. Regioselectivity of C‚ÄìH borylation of arenes versus regioselectivity of electrophilic aromatic substitution The synthetic importance of aromatic C‚ÄìH borylation is shown below, where a 1,3-disubstited aromatic compound can be directly converted to a 1,3,5-organoborane compound and subsequently functionalized. Meta-functionalization of arenes through C‚ÄìH borylation Aromatic C‚ÄìH functionalization was successfully incorporated in the total synthesis of Complanadine A, a Lycopodium alkaloid that enhances mRNA expression for nerve growth factor (NGF) and the production of NGF in human glial cells. Natural products that promote the growth of new neural networks are of interest in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Complanadine A was successfully synthesized using a combination of direct aromatic C‚ÄìH borylation developed by Hartwig and Ishyiama, followed by Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura cross coupling, then cleavage of the Boc protecting group. Synthesis of complanadine A =C‚ÄìH borylation of heteroarenes= Heteroarenes can also undergo borylation under iridium-catalyzed conditions, however, site-selectivity in this case is controlled by electronic effects, where furans, pyrroles, and thiophenes undergo reaction at the C‚ÄìH bond alpha to the heteroatom. In this case selectivity is suggested to occur through the C‚ÄìH bond alpha to the heteroatom because it is the most acidic C‚ÄìH bond and therefore the most reactive. C‚ÄìH borylation of heteraromatics =Directed ortho C‚ÄìH borylation= Using the same catalyst system directing groups can be employed to achieve regioselectivity without substituents as steric mediators. For example, Boebel and Hartwig reported a method to conduct ortho- borylation where a dimethyl-hydrosilyl directing group on the arene undergoes iridium catalyzed borylation at the C‚ÄìH bond ortho to the silane directing group. Selectivity for the ortho position in the case of using hydrosilyl directing groups has been attributed to reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, leading to preferential cleavage of the C‚ÄìH bond ortho to the hydrosilyl substituent. Several other strategies to achieve ortho- borylation of arenes have been developed using various directing groups.Ros, A.; Estepa, B.; Lopez-Rodriquez, R.; Alvarez, E.; Fernandez, R.; Lassaletta, J.M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011; 50, 1. The use of directing groups for selective ortho borylation =Mechanistic detail for the C‚ÄìH borlyation of arenes= A trisboryl iridium complex has been proposed to facilitate the mechanism for each of these reactions that result in C‚ÄìH borylation of arenes and heteroarenes. Kinetic studies and isotopic labelling studies have revealed that an Ir(III) triboryl complex reacts with the arene in the catalytic process.Boller, T.M.; Murphy, J. M.; Hapke, M.; Ishiyama, T.; Miyaura, N.; Hartwig, J.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005;, 127, 14263. A version of the catalytic cycle is shown below for the ortho borylation of hydrosilane compounds. Kinetic data show that an observed trisboryl complex coordinated to cyclooctene rapidly and reversibly dissociates cyclooctene to form a 16 electron trisboryl complex. In the case of using benzyldimethylsilane as a directing group it is proposed that benzyldimethylsilane reacts with the trisboryl iridium catalyst through reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, followed by selective ortho-C‚ÄìH bond activation via oxidative addition and reductive elimination. Mechanism of hydrosilane Meta-Selective Borylation: Meta-Selective C‚ÄìH borylation is an important synthetic transformation, which was discovered in 2002 by Smith III from Michigan State University, USA. However, this meta borylation was completely sterically directed and was limitted to only 1,3-disubstituted benzenes. Around 12 years later, Dr. Chattopadhyay and his team from Centre of Biomedical Research, U.P, India discovered an elegant technology for the meta-selective C‚ÄìH bond activation and borylation. The team had shown that using the same substrate, one can switch the other positional selectivity just changing the ligand. The origin of the meta-selectivity was defined by the two parameter, such as: 1) electrostatic interaction, 2) a secondary B-N interaction. At the same time, a team from Japan, Dr. Kanai reported an amazing concept for the meta-selective borylation based on the secondary interaction. This method covers various carbonyl compounds borylation. Reduction reactions with organoboron compoundsCorey‚ÄìBakshi‚ÄìShibata reduction (CBS reduction)= In 1981, Hirao and co-workers have found that asymmetric reduction of prochiral aromatic ketones with chiral amino alcohols and borane afforded the corresponding secondary alcohols with 60% ee. They found out that the chiral amino alcohols would react with borane to form aloxyl-amine-borane complexes. The complexes are proposed to contain a relatively rigid five member-ring system which makes them thermal and hydrolytic stable and soluble in a wide variety of protic and aprotic solvents. Corey‚ÄìBakshi‚ÄìShibata reduction (CBS reduction)-1 In 1987, E. J. Corey and co-workers found out that the formation of oxazaborolidines from borane and chiral amino alcohols. And the oxazaborolidines were found to catalyze the rapid and highly enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones in the presence of BH3THF. This enantioselective reduction of achiral ketones with catalytic oxazaborolidine is called Corey‚ÄìBakshi‚ÄìShibata reduction or CBS reduction. Corey-Bakshi- Shibata Reduction (CBS Reduction)-2 =Midland Alpine-borane reduction (Midland reduction)= In 1977, M. M. Midland and co-workers reported a surprising observation that B-3-alpha-Pinanyl-9-borabicyclo [3,3,1] nonane, readily prepared by hydroboration of (+)-alpha-pinene with 9-borobicyclo[3,3,1] nonane, rapidly reduces benzaldehyde-alpha-d to (S)-(+)-benzyl-alpha-d alcohol with an essentially quantitative asymmetric induction. Midland Alpine-Borane Reduction (Midland Reduction) In the same year, M. M. Midland discovered B-3-alpha-pinanyl-9-BBN as the reducing agent, which could be easily available by reacting (+)-alpha-pinene with 9-BBN. The new reducing agent was later commercialized by Aldrich Co. under the name Alpine Borane and the asymmetric reduction of carbonyl groups with either enantiomer of Alpine-Borane is known as Midland Alpine-Borane reduction. In 2012, U. R. Y. Venkateswarlu and co-workers have reported a stereoselective method to synthesize pectinolide H. Midland reduction and Sharpless dihydroxylation reaction are involved in generating the three chiral centers at C‚Äì4‚Äô, C‚Äì5 and C‚Äì1‚Äô. Application of Midland Alpine-Borane Reduction Coupling reactions with organoboron compoundsPetasis boronic acid- Mannich reaction= In 1993, N. A. Petasis and I. Akrltopoulou reported an efficient synthesis of allylic amines with a modified Mannich reaction. In this modified Mannich reaction, they have found that vinyl boronic acids can participate as nucleophiles to give geometrically pure allylamines. This modified Mannich reaction was known as Petasis boronic acid-Mannich Reaction. Petasis Boronic Acid-Mannich Reaction =Roush asymmetric allylation= In 1978, R. W. Hoffmann and T. Herold reported on the enantioselective synthesis of secondary homoallyl alcohols via chiral non-racemic allylboronic esters. The homoallylic alcohols were formed with excellent yield and moderate enantioselectivity. Roush Asymmetric Allylation-1 In 1985, W. R. Roush and co- workers found out that tartrate modified allylic boronates offer a simple, highly attractive approach to the control of facial selectivity in reactions with chiral and achiral aldehydes. In the following years, W.R. Roush and co- workers extended this strategy to the synthesis of 2-butene-1,4-diols and anti-diols. This kind of reaction is known as Rouch asymmetric allylation. Roush Asymmetric Allylation-2 In 2011, R. A. Fernandes and P. Kattanguru have completed an improved total synthesis of (8S, 11R, 12R)- and (8R, 11R, 12R)-topsentolide B2 diastereomers in eight steps. In the paper, diastereoselective Roush allylation reaction was used as a key reaction in the total synthesis to introduce two chiral intermediate. And then the authors synthesized the two diastereomers through these two chiral intermediates. Application of Roush allylation reaction =Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura cross-coupling= In 1979, N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki reported the synthesis of arylated (E)-alkenes in high yield from aryl halides with alkyl-1-enylboranes and catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and bases. Then A. Suzuki and co-workers extend this kind of reaction to other organoboron compounds and other alkenyl, aryl, alkyl halides and triflate. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction organoboron compounds and these organic halides to form carbon-carbon bonds are known as Suzuki‚ÄìMiyaura Cross-Coupling. Suzuki- Miyaura Cross-Coupling In 2013, Joachim Podlech and co-workers determined the structure of Alternaria mycotoxin altenuic acid III by NMR spectroscopic analysis and completed its total synthesis. In the synthetic strategy, Suzuki- Miyaura Cross-Coupling reaction was used with a highly functionalized boronate and butenolides to synthesize a precursor of the natural product in high yield. Application of Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction =Modified Ullmann biaryl ether and biaryl amine synthesis= In 1904, Fritz Ullmann found out that copper powder could significantly improve the reaction of aryl halides with phenols to give biaryl ethers. This reaction is known as Ullmann condensation. In 1906, I. Goldberg extended this reaction to synthesize an arylamine by reacting aryl halides with an amide in the presence of Potassium Carbonate and CuI. This reaction is known as Goldberg modified Ullmann condensation. In 2003, R. A. Batey and T. D. Quach have modified this kind of reactions by using potassium organotrifluoroborates salts to react with aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic amines or anilines to synthesize aryl ethers or aryl amines.

In 1900 she began developing the ‚Äúhousehold science‚Äù (later called ‚ÄúHome Economics‚Äù) program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Early life and education Bevier was born on a farm in central Ohio in 1860, the youngest of 9 children. From a very early age she was destined to become a teacher. After only 2 years of high school she enrolled in the University of Wooster (just north of Columbus, Ohio) where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1885. After teaching in high school she returned to earn a master's degree in Latin and German in 1888. The educational experiences that changed the course of her professional life began when she enrolled in a summer chemistry course at the Case School for Applied Science (today known as Case Western Reserve University). She was the first woman to apply to this program. Sparked by an interest in chemistry she continued to study applied chemistry issues at Harvard, Wesleyan University and MIT. Through her studies with Wilbur O. Atwater, a pioneer in agricultural chemistry, Bevier began work on food science and nutrition. At MIT she worked with Ellen Richards, first president of the American Home Economics Association (AHEA) in 1908, on her ground breaking food and sanitary chemistry. Teaching career Bartow quotes a letter of recommendation for Bevier in 1885 stating, ‚ÄúShe has the ‚Äòteacher tact‚Äô that must be born in one, for it cannot be acquired.\\" Bevier‚Äôs high school teaching career was brief. She taught Latin and English for one year (1885) at Shelby High School in Ohio and then two years (1885-1887) in Mt. Vernon, Ohio teaching botany, English and math. In 1888 she began her career in higher education. For nine years she was a Professor of Natural Sciences at Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as Chatham University) in Pittsburg. She went on to teach at Lake Erie College in 1898-99. In 1900 she was recruited by Andrew Draper to develop a program in Household Science (Home Economics) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. For the next 21 years she taught and provided leadership to one of the most influential Home Economics programs in the United States. Establishment of Household Science at the University of Illinois Prior to Bevier‚Äôs arrival at Illinois, John Milton Gregory had hired Louisa Catherine Allen in 1874 to establish a domestic science program, but this program was ended in 1880. Bevier was not interested in creating a cooking and sewing school, she was determined to create a program based on science that addressed the everyday issues in the lives of women, children and families. She along with Eugene Davenport, Dean of the College of Agriculture, specifically chose the name ‚ÄúHousehold Science‚Äù for the program to emphasize the ‚Äúscience‚Äù aspect. Leadership of the American Home Economics Association (AHEA) Isabel Bevier was in the forefront of the professionalization of home economics. She was part of the initial group that founded AHEA in 1908. That year she participated in the drafting of the organization‚Äôs Bylaws and was elected First Vice-President. In 1911 she succeeded Ellen Richards as the President of AHEA. She also served on the editorial board of the society‚Äôs first scientific journal, the Journal of Home Economics. Contributions to home front in World War I During World War I, home economists played a significant role in helping American families manage food shortages and the lack of other basic resources. Isabel Bevier served as the Illinois Chair of the Thrift and Conservation Department of the Woman‚Äôs Committee of the Council of National Defense. Later she was Director of Home Economics in President Herbert Hoover‚Äôs Food Administration. In each of these roles she was responsible for applying the lessons of food preservation, nutrition and clothing conservation to the wartime shortages of food and other basic necessities. This work demonstrated the value of applying science to home and family life. Contributions to Science and Education Bevier is less known for her scientific work than her teaching. However, Bevier was instrumental in applying the principles of chemistry to the study of food preparation and preservation. She reported findings about the chemical processes of bread making, was the first to use food thermometers to monitor the cooking of meat and she made contributions to our understanding of various means of food substitutes. Bevier published two major books in her lifetime. The House, published in 1907 served as the basic introductory textbook for her original course at the University of Illinois. In addition to describing the design and construction of family homes, this book is a manifesto of Bevier‚Äôs views on the importance of applying science to the challenges faced by families and to the importance of educating women. She also wrote Home Economics in Education (1924) that described her ideas about home economics education. Legacy at the University of Illinois The program in Household Science established by Bevier has gone through many changes since its beginning in 1900. Today the original areas of study within Household Science including nutrition/food science, child and family development and consumer economics are now independent department units. Each area of study has evolved into its own specialized scientific domain. Nevertheless, each unit still owes a substantial debt to the vision of Bevier who understood that by applying scientific study to women, children and family issues that we could develop knowledge and applications that could improve the health and well-being of people. Today‚Äôs study of food safety and nutrition, the understanding of human development and principles of family finance owe much to Bevier‚Äôs pioneering scientific and educational vision.

Sandwiched between a strip of hotels and the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk and Promenade, the pier thrives on tourists and vacationers. Pier 14 is a sufficient example of a modern pleasure pier with its draw for tourism and its recreational purposes.  History  Since 1926, a pier has stood in Pier 14's site. Pier 14 in its present form originated in 1984, gaining approval and a 25-year shelf life from the Corps of Engineers, and acting as a night club of sorts. When that conception failed to garner much success, the structure was reconfigured as a restaurant and lounge in 1986. Under the ownership and management of current owner Bryan Devereux, efforts were rewarded.  Hurricane Hugo  In September, 1989, Hurricane Hugo wreaked havoc on the east coast. Pier 14 suffered many damages, including the loss of its 90-foot pier that extended over the ocean. Devereux stated the pier would need to be closed for at least three weeks in order to repair damages; five months passed before the restaurant reopened in March 1990. Making the most of the rough situation, the owners refurbished the pier and made a few new additions, such as a bait and tackle shop, in 1991. Also attempted was an expansion of the restaurant in 1996, but a special permit to do so was not granted, as regulations concerning the expansion of seaward structures were made stricter in response to Hurricane Hugo. Destroyed piers are allowed to be restored to their original dimensions but not expanded, and since the restaurant was the item in debate, it did not fall under the category of a water-dependent structure.  Features  One of ten public piers along the Grand Strand, Pier 14 has benefitted greatly from the opening of the new Myrtle Beach Boardwalk and Promenade in 2010. Though most piers are best suited for casting a line, Pier 14 supporters argue that its more traditional uses are of the more social, such as sightseeing, dining, dancing. Pier 14 reinforces tourist culture, taking its place alongside the dozens of other east coast piers that thrive on vacation communities and withstand tropical storms and hurricanes alike.

It is also an advocacy organization that aims to change the representation of women in the news media. Every five years since 1995 the GMMP collects data on indicators of gender in the news, such as: the presence of women, gender bias, and stereotyping. The most recent study, conducted in 2015, encompassed 114 countries. History The idea for a media monitoring project was created at the Women Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok in 1994. The World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) along with MediaWatch (Canada) took up the project. They had several key goals: *To map the representation and portrayal of women in the world‚Äôs mainstream news media *To develop a grassroots research instrument *To build solidarity among gender and communication groups worldwide *To create media awareness *To develop media monitoring skills on an international level Coverage The 1995 Report covered 71 countries, and was conducted by volunteers over the span of one day. Consequent studies took place in 2000 and covered 70 countries, in 2005 covering 76 countries, in 2010 in 108 countries and in 2015 in 114 countries. All of the monitoring and compiling of reports is carried out by volunteers. GMMP reports have been presented at the Women‚Äôs NGO Forum in Beijing (1995), the UN Beijing + 5 (2000), a parallel-session at the Commission on the Status of Women 2010 session, and in 100 Women BBC series 2015 \\"Is News Failing Women?\\". 2015 Report The 2015 Project covered 22,136 news items, 26,010 news personnel, and 45,402 total news subjects in newspaper, radio, television, internet news and news media tweets. The research discussed news subjects, personnel and content through the framework of media accountability to women . Pdf. News Subjects The report discovered that progress towards gender parity in the news has almost ground to a halt over the period 2010 to 2015: Women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in newspaper, television and radio news, exactly as they did in 2010. Over the past two decades, the gender gap in people in the news has narrowed most dramatically in Latin America by 13 percent. Women are three percent less visible in political news stories now than five years ago. They comprise 38% of people interviewed on the basis of personal experience compared to 31% in 2005. North America has the highest percentage of women experts in the news (32%), followed by the Caribbean (29%) and Latin America (29%). In 2015, progress towards news representation that acknowledges women's participation in economic life remain elusive: While women in the real world hold at least 40% of paid employment globally, in the news world only 20% of the workers in the formal labor force are women, while 67% of the news world unemployed and stay-at-home parents are women. Portrayals of women as survivors of domestic violence have risen by more than four times across the period 2005 to 2015. Reporters and Presenters The 2015 GMMP detected what appears to be a global glass ceiling for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters. News Content 9% of stories overall contain reference to legal, rights or policy frameworks, with social and legal stories making the highest contribution to the global average. A rights angle is barely present is political and economic stories. 97% of political stories in Asia, 98% of economic stories in the Pacific region and the Middle East perform poorly on the rights-focus yardstick. 14% of stories by female reporters focus centrally on women, in contrast to 9% of stories by their male counterparts. 9% of stories evoke gender equality or inequality issues, more than double the percentage documented in 2005. Only 4% of stories clearly challenge gender stereotypes, a one percent change since 2005. Digital News Women's relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into digital news delivery platforms: Only 26% of the people in internet news stories and media news tweets combined are women. Women report five percent more stories online than in the traditional mediums combined: 42% of online news are reported by women. Gender difference in source selection by female and male reporters becomes starker in online news: Women are 33% of sources in stories by online news female reporters, compared to 23% in stories by men. Only 4% of news media tweets clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of print, radio and television stories that challenge such stereotypes. Implications The GMMP 1995 - 2015 findings paint a picture in which unequal gender power relations are entrenched and validated, and in which gender stereotypes are replicated and reinforced by the world's news media. That the patterns of underrepresentation, misrepresentation and invisibilization of women have continued into the digital news world show that the problem is deeply entrenched in the mainstream news media system irrespective of the platform through which news are channeled.

She is the author of two romance novels, both of which rose to the top of Amazon.com bestseller lists for romantic fiction within their first few months of being self-published. This feat, achieved through targeted and sustained online book promotion among fiction bloggers, and the Nigerian online and traditional media, brought her to the attention of literary circles in Nigeria where romance and fiction in general, is not very common. Her books have been described as showing that not only do Nigerians \\"fall in love and marry for love, [but] also use love to conquer a wide range of situations that could have ordinarily been a bit difficult to shoulder alone.\\" Personal life and education Nkem Okotcha was born on 26 October 1977 and is the second of five children with three sisters and one brother immediately after her. She was born in Enugu and had majority of her education in the eastern part of Nigeria. Her family were avid readers, starting with her parents, so books were always around her. Her mother was a school teacher and her father worked for the National Electoral Commission, so her love of reading and education came from them and from the environment of Enugu, which is a part an academic and civil service city. Nkem attended Ekulu Primary School and junior secondary in Queens School, both in Enugu. For her senior secondary school, she transferred to the Loretto Special Science School before moving to the Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Anambra to study Biological Sciences for her first degree. Graduating in 2000, Nkem moved to Abuja, where she lived and worked for several years, ending with a two-year stint in a commercial bank before she left Nigeria in 2006 to study for a master's degree in Public Health Research at the University of Edinburgh. Nkem says she has \\"been a teacher, NGO consultant, banker, skate-hire attendant, and researcher and have worked for the government both in Nigeria and Scotland.\\" Nkem moved to Seattle in the United States after she got married, and currently lives there with her husband though she visits Nigeria regularly for work and vacations. Pseudonym Of her pseudonym, Nkem has said: \\"Myne Whitman is a name I coined myself when I began to write seriously while still in secondary school. Most of the books I read were in English, and since I was writing in English too, I decided my name would be the same. So the pseudonym is a play on the transliterated words of my maiden name, Nkem Okotcha.\\" Writing Nkem says she has had a long-running relationship with writing. While in primary school, she wrote children's adventures for her siblings to read. She wrote some poetry in secondary school, and started writing again, this time in the romance genre, when she entered university. A dry spell followed while she tried to build a career until she resumed writing in 2009 after she got married. Nkem has written two popular romance novels, A Heart to Mend and A Love Rekindled. In addition, she has written several short stories published in various Nigerian media, all under the pen name of Myne Whitman. Blog and website In addition to her writing, Myne Whitman also runs Romance Meets Life, a lifestyle blog about relationships, parenting celebrity and entertainment.

Delacorte Press) Whispers is a 1993 domestic violence novel written by Belva Plain. It takes place in Connecticut, where the young and naive secretary Lynn falls in love with the ambitious and handsome executive Robert. Robert seems like a marvelous partner at first, but has occasional violent outbursts. The novel brings into question whether it is okay for a partner to hit their significant other if it's only \\"every now and then\\". Summary Lynn is a middle class secretary who was born in Iowa. She simple, yet pretty and even though she's smart due to her small town upbringing she is naive. Her self esteem fluctuates between medium and low, finding herself rather ordinary and very short. At work she befriends and later falls in love with her boss, Robert, a handsome and talented young man who is destined to a great future within the company. They start dating and quickly get married. After Robert gets a promotion they move to Connecticut with her two young daughters. At first Robert is sweet and gentle, retelling his life like a fairytale with a tragic past, his parents being lovely but having an untimely death back when he was young, having been married once but tragically being left by his neurotic ex-wife. Lynn gets entangled in a web of sugarcoated lies and half truths and is dazzled by Robert's good looks and gentlemanly demeanor. Yet as time and their marriage progresses Robert lets his true colours show: he's possessive, domineering, controlling, and abusive emotionally, psychologically, and lastly physically. He's a narcissist and a perfectionist that wants to have \\"either the best or nothing\\", demanding everyone to follow the same mantra and exploding if things don't go his way. After a series of events where the truth of his former marriage is revealed he ultimately beats Lynn to near death and ends up without a marriage and without a family. Lynn learns that her self worth is not to be dictated by anyone, that being abused is not something to be ashamed of as it's not her fault, that rather she should stand up for herself and her little family and rise her voice to protect herself and her loved ones. She also realizes that she is not a helpless little woman after all, that she has an inner fire that might not be showy but is just as roaring as anyone else's, giving her the strength to stand on her own two feet, finally opening her restaurant, and letting herself seek her much dreamed happiness. Characters Lynn: The protagonist of the novel, naive, young, pretty and vulnerable, she falls in love with Robert and blames herself for many of the faults he perceives in her which leads to abuse.

History Original logo used when the channel was branded simply as Smooth. As with the current logo, it uses the same style as that used by the radio network. On 1 November 2013, Foxtel announced they were refreshing their music genre channels to allow for more diversity in their offerings. In addition to changes to the channels being offered by MTV Australia and the branding of the audio channels, it was announced that smoothfm would launch a television station that would offer easy listening adult contemporary music which will correspond to their radio network. Smooth is the first radio station in Australia to launch a television channel. Marcia Hines and Cameron Daddo are the faces of the channel. From 11 October 2017, Foxtel Smooth will become a part-day channel, and will only be broadcast between midnight and 6 pm. This is due to a move by Foxtel to enable Foxtel Smooth to share the same broadcast bandwidth as Foxtel Arts, which will in turn only be available between 6 pm and midnight. On 3 June 2020, it was confirmed by Foxtel and NOVA that the channel would cease operations at the end of the month. This follows the announcement in May that Foxtel would be outsourcing its music video channel operations to Network 10's parent company ViacomCBS. Foxtel Arts has reverted back to a 24 hour channel on 1 July 2020.

He is well known for his role in supporting those affected in New Zealand, the United Kingdom and around the world, by cleft lip and palate. He is also well known as a radio journalist and presenter in Christchurch, New Zealand. Early life Ardouin was born in Hastings and grew up near Rye, East Sussex, England with his family before emigrating to Christchurch, New Zealand in 2000. He received most of his early treatment at one of the world's leading cleft hospitals, Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead before moving to New Zealand. Ardouin attended Linwood College in Christchurch where he held the office of Student Representative on the Board of Trustees from 2006‚Äì2009. Career Ardouin first became involved with Cleft New Zealand in September 2005 when he founded Cleft Kids New Zealand. Cleft Kids New Zealand was designed to support young people in New Zealand affected by cleft lip and palate as no such other service for young people existed at the time. Ardouin continued to be involved with the cleft community of New Zealand, with Cleft Kids New Zealand merging with the former Cleft Lip and Palate Support Group (Auckland) Inc to form the new Cleft New Zealand which was opened in late 2009 by Mayor Len Brown. He has continued to be involved with various projects including the 2010 Santa Run, the 2012 roadshow and Ardouin participated in the 2012 Tough Guy Challenge to raise funds and awareness for cleft. Ardouin was elected to the Board of Governors in May 2012 and took over as chief executive officer in late 2012, endeavouring to continue to raise the awareness of cleft in New Zealand and advocate against bullying by educating the public on the condition. In December 2013, Ardouin was heavily involved in the organisation and delivery of Australasia's inaugural youth camp which took place in Auckland, New Zealand, for young people affected by cleft lip and palate and featured a guest appearance via Skype from Carmit Bachar, former member of The Pussycat Dolls. A youth camp had been an aspiration of Ardouin's for many years and he later described the camp as 'a dream come true'. As at August 2018, Ardouin has given over 60 presentations on cleft lip and palate. He has presented on a range of different topics relating to cleft lip and palate in both English and French, including to speech therapists from the Ministry of Education (New Zealand) and to students at the University of Otago. In April 2014, his two most well-known presentations 'Rabbits, Forklifts & Geodes: An Introduction to Cleft Lip and Palate, Possible Causes and the impact on quality of life' and 'It Gets Better: Dealing with Bullying' were streamed to the world through a live YouTube stream, which proved popular around the world and allowed people to access education on cleft lip and palate regardless of where they reside, as part of Ardouin's commitment to sharing resources across international borders. Another initiative of Ardouin's to support cleft care in other countries is the Bottles for Indonesia Programme. Following more than 10 years with the organisation, Ardouin's resignation from Cleft New Zealand was announced on 16 October 2015, and he left his position as Chief Executive Officer on 24 December 2015 in order to accept an undisclosed external position. In early 2018, Ardouin commenced a three-year contract with the Cleft Lip & Palate Association in the United Kingdom working on improving care and support services for people in adulthood who were born with a cleft. Radio career Ardouin commenced as a radio presenter with Volcano Radio 88.5FM Lyttelton in December 2008 with his first programme, Heading Home with Kenny. The show was an afternoon programme known for playing mainstream pop music, and ran for approximately 18 months before Ardouin moved to host a new breakfast show Seismic Shift. Ardouin commenced this programme in September 2010 following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and was named to reflect the programme's diversity of music and Ardouin's bluntness on current affairs. Although starting out as light- hearted, the Seismic Shift became more poignant following 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake which had a devastating effect on the radio station's host town of Lyttelton. Ardouin's programme became more focussed on earthquake recovery at this time, including regular interviews with members of the Earthquake Commission, Christchurch City Council and Prime Minister John Key. Ardouin's programme continued until the city was hit by the June 2011 Christchurch earthquake which caused the closure of Volcano Radio. Ardouin retired from broadcasting at this time, however announced in July 2015 that he will be returning to radio to present a current affairs and investigative journalism programme Wireless Watchdog on Christchurch and Canterbury's Plains FM. The live programme debuted on 6 August 2015 and aired weekly in 2015 on Thursdays at 9pm and Fridays at 11am. Since early 2016, the programme was broadcast fortnightly on alternate Thursdays and Fridays. He is known for promoting equity and equality and challenging those who deny others of this. Awards & honours In June 2013, Ardouin was awarded an award from Tony Ryall, Minister of Health for his contribution to youth health services in New Zealand. Christchurch earthquake book On 22 February 2012 on the one year anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake, Ardouin released his first book My 22 February which details Ardouin's experiences on 22 February 2011 as the earthquake struck his adopted hometown and destroyed his home. When asked why he wrote the book, Ardouin responded 'my story is not the most scary, horrifying or traumatic story out there about the February earthquake, but to me, 12:51 on Tuesday 22 February is all those things...I still get thrown back to that moment in my mind and it was suggested to me that perhaps if I write down exactly what happened that day, it may help me deal with it.' The dedication at the start of the book reads 'dedicated to all those who will never get a chance to tell their story and to their friends and family who are still picking up the pieces'.

Regarded as a seminal work on anatomy, this volume led to Tyson being known as the father of comparative anatomy. The book characterizes in detail the anatomy of a creature described as a pygmy (later known as a chimpanzee) and contains Tyson's views on the phylogeny of the pygmy and its relationship to humans, apes, and monkeys. Title page of Anatomy of a Pygmy The use of the phrase \\"orang-outang\\" does not refer to members of the orangutan genus Pongo, but rather uses the phrase to refer to the habitat of the subject; that is, a \\"person of the forest\\" (orangutan translates from Malay as \\"person of the forest/jungle\\".) Due to the absence of previous literature concerning chimpanzees, it is not clear whether or not the titular subject was a bonobo, Pan paniscus, or a common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, as there was not great prior distinction between the two. Following his summary of the anatomy of the subject, Tyson attaches fours essays concerning the ancients' knowledge of pygmies, cynocephali, satyrs, and sphinges. The book was originally published in 1699 and was republished in 1894 with an introduction which contains a biography of Edward Tyson by Bertram C. A. Windle. Large portions of the book are block quotations in Latin of works from antiquity regarding the anatomy and socialization of the pygmy, much of which Tyson regarded as inaccurate myths and hearsay. Letter of dedication The letter of dedication is addressed to John Sommers, a Lord High Chancellor of England and President of the Royal Society. The letter thanks him for his dedication to the advancement of knowledge, specifically \\"experimental natural philosophy\\". Preface The preface consists of Tyson giving his reasons for conducting the study, \\"to find out the truth, than to enlarge in the mythology; to inform the judgement, than to please the fancy\\". He also laments his inability to compare his findings directly to apes and monkeys, instead having to rely on the works of others, such as Aristotle, Pliny, Galen, and Vesalius. Lastly he apologizes in advance for any mistakes on his part within the book. Organization The book itself is roughly divided into three parts containing Tyson's findings from his dissection of the pygmy and his comparison to previous findings, many of which are in Latin or Greek. Overview Tyson summarizes his observations on the external and internal anatomy of the pygmy, making note of their similarity or differences to humans. Most often he finds that the pygmy is different and \\"inferior\\" to humans, which is typical of the anthropocentrism of the time. Much of the text where he addresses previous findings are in Latin or Greek, although he does give explanations for why these authors' drew the conclusions they did, and why they are different or similar from his, in English. Drawing of a live, male pygmy Drawing of a live, male pygmy Skeleton This section is further subdivided into five sections, with much of the text being in Latin or Greek. Image from Edward Tyson's Anatomy of a Pygmy Muscles This section is not divided, but addresses the musculature of the pygmy from head to feet. Image from Anatomy of a Pygmy Image from Anatomy of a Pygmy Synopsis Here Tyson gives the reader two lists, the first how the pygmy is more like a man than an ape, and the second how the pygmy is more like an ape than a man. =Similarities= A list of features Tyson found present in the pygmy which are more similar to a human than to an ape or a monkey; the terms use modern, common, anatomical terms which may differ from what is found in the book, but have been changed to ease the readers' understanding. # Similar hair morphology of the shoulder and arm. # Similar facial structure: forehead larger than the chin. # The shape of the outer ear, except that the cartilage is thinner and more like an ape. # Thicker fingers than an ape has. # Primarily bipedal. # Larger buttocks than an ape. # Calf muscles. # Wider in the shoulders and pectorals. # Longer heel. # Adipose membrane next to the skin. # Unperforated peritoneum in the groin. # Longer small intestine. # Larger intestinal canal. # Presence of a vermiform appendix; beginning of the colon is not extended. # Insertion of the bile and pancreatic ducts are in the same location. The ape also has this same location, but not a monkey. # Longer large intestine. # The liver is not divided into lobes (which humans do have; this differs from modern anatomical understanding). # Similar bile vessels. # Same spleen. # Same pancreas. # Same number of lobes in each lung. # Pericardium attached to diaphragm. # More rounded apex of the heart. # No pouches in the chaps (unclear). # Much larger brain than in apes, with the same structures as a human brain. # More globular skull; twice as big as an ape's or monkey's. # Same number of cranial sutures. Wormian (intra-sutural) bones also present (though not present in all humans). # Cribriform plate and crista galli are present (present also in apes but not monkeys). # Sella turcica is less prominent than in apes and monkeys. # Pterygoid process present. # Temporal and anterior fontanelle are different in monkeys (but not in apes). # Zygomatic bone more similar to humans (smaller than in monkeys and apes). # Shape of the teeth, especially the canines and molars. # Transverse apophysis of C6 and C7 vertebra are more like a human's. # Cervical vertebra lack foramen for containing the nerves (not the spinal cord, but rather peripheral nerves which travel to the rest of the body) which are present in monkeys. # Number of thoracic and lumbar apophyses. # Five vertebrae in the loins (could refer to lumbar vertebrae, of which monkey and apes have six). # Lumbar vertebrae are straight. # Five sacral elements; three in apes and monkeys. # Four unperforated segments of the coccyx; monkeys have more. # Seven true ribs which articulate in the body of the vertebrae; in apes and monkeys there are eight which articulate in the interstices of the vertebrae. # Broad sternum; narrow in monkeys. # Larger phalanges than in apes. # Femur articulates and is shaped more like a human's. # Round, single patella, not long and double like in an ape. # Same heel, tarsals, and metatarsals as a human. # Middle toe is not the longest, as it is in apes and monkeys. # The obliquus capitis inferior, pyriformis, and biceps femoris are a human's. All other muscles are like the human's as well, but are not distinguishably different from an ape or monkey the same, either from lack of subject or previous observations. =Differences= A list of features Tyson found were more similar between the pygmy and the ape and monkey, and less similar to a human. # Stature. # Flat nose. # Cranial ridge beneath the eyebrow. # Hairier. # Smaller thumb, than a human or an ape, more like a monkey's. # Long, narrow palms. # Longer toes. # Great toes are opposable, like thumbs. # Shorter (less tall) at the shoulder and thigh. # Longer arms. # Scrotum not pendulous. # Larger omentum. # Long and slender gall bladder. # The kidneys rounder than in humans, and the ureters are different. # Longer urinary bladder # No preputium frenum. # Eye orbit protrudes inward, toward the brain. # Lack of cavities beneath the sella turcica. # The mastoid and styloid processes are very small, almost absent. # Flat bone of the nose. # Number of teeth. # Short, flat-front cervical vertebra without bifide spines. # No spine in the fifth cervical vertebra. # Number of thoracic vertebra: twelve in man, ten in apes, thirteen in a pygmy. # Same number of vertebra or elements in the sacrum as an ape. # Thirteen ribs on each side; humans have twelve. # Smaller thumb bones than humans have. # The ilium is exactly like an ape's, that is longer, narrower, and less concave than a man's. # Length of the bones of the toes; the great toe is opposable like an ape's. # Lack of occipitalis, frontalis, dilator naris, levator labii superioris, interspinales cervicis, gluteus minimus, extensor digitorum pedi brevis, and transversalis pedi. # Lack of pyramidales, palmaris longus, attollens auriculum, and retrains auriculum. # Levator claviculae are present (absent in humans). # Longus colli, pectoralis, latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, psoas major, psoas minor, iliacus internus, and the gastrocnemius internalis are more similar to apes and monkeys than humans. # Deltoid, pronator radii trees, and extensors pollicis brevis are different from a human's.

Brachydeirids have, in cross section, a highly compressed body, a pointed, sometimes highly elongated snout, and tremendous orbits. The plates of the trunk shield are noticeably shortened: in Synauchenia, the trunk shield and head shield are fused together as a single, immovable unit. The superficial anatomy of brachydeirids is extremely diverse, and each genus has been previously placed in their own monogeneric families. The brachydeirids, together with Leptosteus, make up the superfamily Brachydeiroidea. Genera=Brachydeirus The half a dozen species of Brachydeirus are comparable (on a superficial level) in form and size to trout or small mackerels. The biting surfaces of the infragnathals are smooth and thick, suggesting an adaptation for crushing. Species of Brachydeirus are all restricted to the Kellwasserkalk Fauna of Bad Wildungen and Adorf. Oxyosteus Oxyosteus is easily distinguished by a high, extremely compressed body and a long, thin rostrum. Two named species are known from the Bad Wildungen Kellwasserkalk Fauna, while a dorsal plate of an as of yet unnamed species is known from the middle Frasnian-aged portion of the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland.

It was first published in Songs of Innocence (1789) and later in Songs of Innocence and Experience (1794). The first plate of \\"Spring\\" The second plate of \\"Spring\\" Background William Blake's Songs of Innocence (1789) is a lyric anthology that consists of nineteen illuminated poems. Each poem is accompanied with an illustration by Blake. Songs of Innocence was later combined with Blake's Songs of Experience in 1794 to make Songs of Innocence and Experience, and were printed combined as well as separately.http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/work.xq?workid=s-inn&java;=no PoemStyle The poem is split into three stanzas. The rhyme scheme goes AABBCCDDE. The last line of each stanza is the same to show the joy the author has for this time of year. The poem is written in dactylic feet. There are several reference's to other poems or characters from Blake's \\"Songs of Innocence.\\" For example, the introduction of this poem speaks of the flutist, which comes from several of Blake's poems and is illustrated on the front piece for Songs of Innocence. The poem refers The Little Boy, from the poems \\"The Little Boy lost\\" and \\"The Little Boy found\\". The Little Girl, who appears in several poems in Songs of Experience is mentioned.. The poem also references the Lamb, from the poem \\"The Lamb\\". Together Blake incorporates these characters into a happy poem welcoming Springtime, which marks the beginning of a new year for them.http://www.english.uga.edu/wblake/SONGS/22/springbibliography.html Interpretation \\"Spring\\" is a happily written poem with a hint of rhyme. Devoted to Blake's favorite things, each stanza describing a particular thing. The first stanza is about birds and a bush, the second a little boy and a little girl, and in the final stanza the lamb and \\"I\\". This format shows the transition from innocence to a bit of romance, where the child and lamb become close. They share a touch and a kiss in this stanza, and the final line changes from the first two stanzas. With only a single word change, going from \\"to\\" to \\"we\\", representing the growth of the characters, and how they deviate from the \\"innocent\\" title given to them. In Songs of Innocence several of the poems seem to be linked closely together. Scholars typically associate Spring with \\"The Echoing Green\\" due to fourth line in the first stanza \\"To welcome the Spring,\\".

Transient problems are often solved by conducting simulations using computer- aided engineering (CAE) packages, which require discretizing the governing equations in both space and time. Such problems are unsteady (e.g. flow problems), and therefore require solutions in which position varies as a function of time. Temporal discretization involves the integration of every term in different equations over a time step (Œît). The spatial domain can be discretized to produce a semi-discrete form: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}(x,t) = F(\\\\varphi).~ If the discretization is done using backward differences, the first-order temporal discretization is given as:Selection of Spatial and Temporal discretization : \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^{n+1} - \\\\varphi^n}{\\\\Delta t} = F(\\\\varphi), And the second-order discretization is given as: : \\\\frac{3\\\\varphi^{n+1} - 4\\\\varphi^{n}+\\\\varphi^{n-1}}{2\\\\Delta t} = F(\\\\varphi), where : œÜ = a scalar quantity. : n + 1 = value at the next time level, t + Œît. : n = value at the current time level, t. : n ‚àí 1 = value at the previous time level, t ‚àí Œît. The function F(\\\\varphi) is evaluated using implicit- and explicit-time integration.  Description  The temporal discretization is done through integration over time on the general discretized equation. First, values at a given control volume P at time interval t are assumed and then value at time interval t+Œît is found. This method states that the time integral of a given variable is equal to a weighted average between current and future values. The integral form of the equation can be written as: : \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^{n+1} - \\\\varphi^n}{\\\\Delta t} = f\\\\cdot F( \\\\varphi^{n+1}) + (1-f) \\\\cdot F( \\\\varphi^n ), where ∆í is a weight between 0 and 1. : ∆í = 0.0 results in the fully explicit scheme. : ∆í = 1.0 results in the fully implicit scheme. : ∆í = 0.5 results in the Crank-Nicolson scheme. For any control volume this integration holds true for any discretized variable. The following equation is obtained when applied to the governing equation including full discretized diffusion, convection, and source terms. : \\\\int\\\\limits_t^{t+\\\\Delta t} F(\\\\varphi) \\\\, dt = [ f\\\\cdot F_\\\\varphi^{t+\\\\Delta t} + (1-f)\\\\cdot F_\\\\varphi^t ] \\\\, \\\\Delta t  Methods for evaluating function F(\\\\varphi)  After discretizing the time derivative, function F(\\\\varphi) remains to be evaluated. The function is now evaluated using implicit and explicit-time integration.Jirka Simunek Implicit-time integration This methods evaluates the function F(\\\\varphi) at a future time. =Formulation= The evaluation using implicit-time integration is given as: : \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^{n+1} - \\\\varphi^n}{\\\\Delta t} = F( \\\\varphi^{n+1} ), This is called implicit integration as \\\\varphi^{n+1} in a given cell is related to \\\\varphi^{n} in neighboring cells through F(\\\\varphi^{n+1}) : : \\\\varphi^{n+1} = \\\\varphi^n + \\\\Delta t F( \\\\varphi^{n+1} ), In case of implicit method, the setup is unconditionally stable and can handle large time step (Œît). But, stability doesn't mean accuracy. Therefore, large Œît affects accuracy and defines time resolution. But, behavior may involve physical timescale that needs to be resolved.  Explicit-time integration  This methods evaluates the function F(\\\\varphi) at a current time. =Formulation= The evaluation using explicit-time integration is given as: : \\\\frac{\\\\varphi^{n+1} - \\\\varphi^n}{\\\\Delta t} = F(\\\\varphi^n), And is referred as explicit integration since \\\\varphi^{n+1} can be expressed explicitly in the existing solution values, \\\\varphi^{n}: : \\\\varphi^{n+1} = \\\\varphi^n + \\\\Delta t \\\\, F( \\\\varphi^n ), Here, the time step (Œît) is restricted by stability limit of the solver (i.e., time step is limited by the Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy condition. To be accurate w.r.t time, same time step should be used in all the domain and to be stable, the time step must be the minimum of all the local time steps in the domain.

She is best known as a member of the kawaii metal band Babymetal. She is represented by the talent agency Amuse, Inc. and has been a member of three musical groups formed by the company: Karen Girl's, Sakura Gakuin, and Babymetal.  Biography  In 2002, Nakamoto won the Grand Prix in the Image Girl contest for Jewel Drop, a line of toy cosmetics produced by Bandai, subsequently starring in several Jewel Drop commercials. In 2006, Nakamoto was admitted to Actor's School Hiroshima (ASH). She studied with another future Sakura Gakuin member, Mariri Sugimoto, with whom she had been acquainted before attending the school. She also had a rivalry with Riho Sayashi, future Morning Musume member and Babymetal support dancer, as they were considered the school's top two students at the time. In 2007, she was signed to the talent agency Amuse, Inc. after becoming a runner- up in the 2nd Star Kids Audition held by the company. In 2008, her agency formed a trio called Karen Girl's, and Suzuka was selected to be in it. The group was introduced as a little sister of the girl trio Perfume and sang several theme songs for the anime Zettai Karen Children, disbanding on March 31, 2009, after the anime ended its run. In April 2010, Nakamoto became a founding member of Sakura Gakuin, an idol group created by her agency. The group members also formed sub-units called ‚Äúclubs‚Äù, each of which released their own songs as a unit. Suzuka became a member of the , which released songs under the name Babymetal, which also included fellow Sakura Gakuin members Yui Mizuno and Moa Kikuchi. In the spring of 2013, Nakamoto graduated from junior high school and therefore had to \\"graduate\\" from Sakura Gakuin (which limits girls up to the junior high age). Her graduation concert was held on March 31 at the Tokyo International Forum. Suzuka now performs with Babymetal, which had been spun off from Sakura Gakuin following her graduation, under the stage name Su-metal. Babymetal's self-titled debut album was released in February 2014. Nakamoto ranked ninth place on the Oricon News ranking for ‚Äú2018 Rankings for Anticipation of New Adults‚Äù, commenting on her \\"overwhelming singing ability\\". Personal life Suzuka is the youngest of three sisters. Her second sister, Himeka Nakamoto, is a former member of the idol group Nogizaka46. They studied together at the Actor's School Hiroshima (ASH) and sang together in a duo known as Tween. Her mother works with gemstones and occasionally gives gemstone accessories to the Babymetal members as a gift.

A ruckman, McLean managed just three senior VFL appearances in 1980 and 1981.AFL Tables: Glenn McLean McLean was however regularly selected in 1982, with veteran Garry Baker on the sidelines because of a knee injury and another ruckman Michael Byrne crossing to Hawthorn. McLean played in nine of the first ten rounds that year, before breaking his wrist, but returned to finish with 15 games for the season.The Age, \\"Templeton To See Specialist\\", 31 May 1982, p. 36 In the 1983 VFL season he shared ruck duties with Brownlow Medalist Peter Moore and was the only Melbourne player to appear in all 22 rounds. McLean finished fifth in Melbourne's best and fairest. In 1984, McLean was the centre of controversy over his attempt early in the season to move from Melbourne to Collingwood. The clearance wrangle went to the supreme court and McLean was eventually let go by Melbourne, in a trade which secured the club Tony Keenan.The Age, \\"McLean dropped - Fellowes back\\", 27 July 1984, p. 14 He played in rounds 15 and 16, before losing his place in the Collingwood team. In January 1986, McLean was one of five players sacked by the club, along with Graeme Allan, Allen Eade, Tony Kelly and Jim McAllester.The Age, \\"Kelly's notice ends Pie sackings\\", 29 January 1986, p. 28 McLean's brother Paul played one game for VFL club Fitzroy in 1987.

A graduate of the University of California, San Francisco, Rao held a Helen Hay Whitney fellowship at Harvard University and was on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis and Northwestern University before moving back to China to take up the deanship of Peking University's School of Life Sciences in 2007. He is currently the director the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University. He took office as the President of the Capital Medical University on June 25, 2019. Personal life and education Rao was born in Jiangxi in 1962. In college, he was friends with Mei Lin, who also became a neurobiologist later. In graduate school at Shanghai Medical University, Rao was roommates with , now also an eminent neurobiologist. At SMU, his interests began to turn to molecular neurobiology. In 1985, Rao enrolled at the University of California at San Francisco. He describes the atmosphere at UCSF as far more exciting than that to which he had previously been exposed in China. His advisors were Yuh-Nung and Lily Jan. He discovered the big brain gene, which is required for a binary decision in neural development: to form a neuron or an epidermal cell. He defended his doctoral thesis on molecular and genetic analysis of intercellular communication in Drosophila neurogenesis at UCSF in 1991. Career and research interests After graduating from UCSF, Rao received a Helen Hay Whitney fellowship for postdoctoral research in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard University, where he worked on embryonic induction in vertebrates. He then joined the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis in 1994, where he established his first laboratory. He moved to Northwestern University in Chicago in 2004, and was named the university's first Elsa A. Swanson Research Professor in 2006. Other honours he received include the Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience in 2000, as well as the Charles B. Wilson Brain Tumor Research Excellence Award in Neuroscience. He also served on the editorial board of The Journal of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Developmental Brain Research, Neuroscience Research He moved back to China in 2007 to be the dean of Peking University's School of Life Sciences. He stepped down from the deanship in 2013. In 1997, Rao discovered that a single origin gave rise to two eyes in frog and chicken embryos. In 1999, he demonstrated that the secreted protein encoded by the Slit gene was a repellent guidance cue for axons. He has later found that Slit could repel migrating neurons, chemotactic leukocytes and brain tumor cells. Rao has uncovered major components in the signal transduction pathways for Slit and the axon attractant Netrin. In China, Rao switched to studies of molecular and cellular mechanisms of behaviors and has found neurotransmitters required for aggression and courtship in Drosophila and the mouse. Science funding reform advocacy Rao Yi is one of the leading reformers of science and education in China. He participated directly in the reform or establishment of five institutes and writes about science and culture for a wide audience. While in the U.S., he began his involvement with academia in China, working with Lu Bai and Mei Lin to establish a joint lab in Shanghai in 1995. They then joined Mu-ming Poo of UC Berkeley on a proposal to establish the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai in 1999. In 2002, Rao and Uli Schwarz of the Max Planck Institute established the Shanghai Institute of Advanced Studies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for which they served as co-directors till 2005. In 2004, Xiaodong Wang, Xingwang Deng and Rao established the National Institute of Biological Sciences, for which Rao served as an Associate Director for Academic Affairs until 2009. In 2004, Rao, Bai Lu and Chenlu Tsou advocated for changes in China's system of grants for scientific research, questioning the involvement of bureaucrats and the emphasis on connections rather than merit in a paper () which suggested alternatives to the Mid-to-Long Term Plan of Science and Technology. He levelled sharper criticisms in a 2010 Science editorial with fellow ex- American Shi Yigong () which drew widespread focus to corruption and embezzlement from research funds. The Ministry of Science and Technology disputed Shi and Rao's claims, stating that there was \\"zero tolerance\\" for misconduct. The year after the article, both Rao and Shi failed to be named to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the first round of voting among members in its biennial membership elections. Rao and Shi's failure to be named among the 145 candidates on the longlist for membership was widely believed to be tied to their criticisms, and in response Rao announced in a post on ScienceNet.cn that he would refuse to stand for election to the CAS again in the future. Since 2007, Rao successfully established the tenure track system in the School of Life Sciences, with international peer reviews of academic merits as the important criteria for hiring, promotion and firing. In 2012, Rao and Yigong Shi established the Center for Life Sciences, with Rao serving as the director of Peking part and Shi as the director of the Tsinghua part. In 2013, Rao established the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University and serves as its founding director. In 2018, Rao established the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR), Beijing and serves as its founding co- director. In 2019, Rao was appointed the president of the Capital Medical University. Other views In 2009, two years after his return to China, Rao renounced his U.S. citizenship; in a written statement to the U.S. embassy in Beijing during that process, he criticized the US government for its behaviors after the September 11th attacks. Rao expects that he will live to see democracy in China. Rao is a supporter of genetically modified food, and believes that even if China opposes GM food, it will simply result in the collapse of local companies while foreign companies strengthen their hold on the industry. Rao came under criticism from both Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party politicians in Taiwan for his private letter relating to the addresses of Beijing and Taiwan researchers involved in scientific collaboration. In a 2011 letter to National Science Council head Lee Lou- chuang, Rao proposed that a paper in which Peking University researchers had collaborated with National Tsing Hua University researchers in Taiwan identify each institution's location without the use of political terms \\"People's Republic\\" or \\"Republic\\". This would lead to Peking University's location being listed as \\"Beijing, China\\", and NTHU as located in \\"Taipei, China\\". However, Taiwan's National Science Council requires researchers it funds to list their location either as \\"Taiwan\\" or \\"Taiwan, Republic of China\\". The director of Taiwan's National Science Council did not reply to Rao's letter, but revealed it to the general public of Taiwan instead. KMT caucus whip Chao Li-yun () conveyed the KMT's condemnation of Rao for his suggestion, while Chen Ting-fei of the DPP criticised President Ma Ying-jeou for \\"submitting to humiliation\\" by not speaking up about the matter. Taiwan newspapers published about the uproar without interviewing Rao or showing any contacts from Taiwan asking Rao's opinions or explanations. The collaboration between Rao and NTHU researchers was not affected.

Following a leave from the show Legend \\"S\\" Baptism XX, Mizuno was absent from Babymetal's tour of the United States in May 2018, with no advance warning. Amid fan speculation on Mizuno's status with the group, a representative of 5B Management, the American management company representing Babymetal, replied to an inquiry from Alternative Press Magazine by saying that \\"Yuimetal remains a member of the band, but she is not on this current U.S. tour.\\" However, she was also absent from Babymetal's European tour in June 2018. On October 19, 2018, Babymetal officially announced that Yuimetal would not be joining the band for the next phase of their tour and would no longer be a member of the group due to poor health. Mizuno herself released a statement shortly after about her decision to leave Babymetal, explaining that she may go on to pursue a solo career in the future.http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/babymetal-parts-ways-with-yuimetal- releases-new-single-starlight/ Personal life In third grade, Mizuno was a fan of Karen Girl's, Suzuka Nakamoto's previous group, and had dreamed of joining the group after their music helped her endure the \\"life-threatening\\" illness of a family member. The group disbanded, however, and she attended the group's farewell concert and met all three members. During the Legend \\"D\\" concert in 2012, Babymetal performed a cover of the Karen Girl's song \\"Over the Future\\". Mizuno says that moment was when her \\"dreams came true\\". She and her family are also close friends with Karen Girl's member Ayami Muto and her family; Mizuno and Muto were both members of Sakura Gakuin. Mizuno is known for being fond of tomatoes and likes to eat them whole. She has stated that she would want to eat tomatoes even when the world is ending. Mizuno has specified in one of her Sakura Gakuin diary entry that she loves to stargaze. She loves to look up to the stars during her commute time from school to home. She has also stated in her diary entry that she loves to read books about constellations as well. Mizuno has two brothers, one older and one two years younger than her.

Scranton, PA data scientist Daniel Allen in 1996 proposed Data in use as a complement to the terms data in transit and data at rest which together define the three states of digital data.  Alternative definitions  Data in use refers to data in computer memory. Some cloud software as a service (SaaS) providers refer to data in use as any data currently being processed by applications, as the CPU and memory are utilized.  Concerns  Because of its nature, data in use is of increasing concern to businesses, government agencies and other institutions. Data in use, or memory, can contain sensitive data including digital certificates, encryption keys, intellectual property (software algorithms, design data), and personally identifiable information. Compromising data in use enables access to encrypted data at rest and data in motion. For example, someone with access to random access memory can parse that memory to locate the encryption key for data at rest. Once they have obtained that encryption key, they can decrypt encrypted data at rest. Threats to data in use can come in the form of cold boot attacks, malicious hardware devices, rootkits and bootkits.  Full memory encryption  Encryption, which prevents data visibility in the event of its unauthorized access or theft, is commonly used to protect Data in Motion and Data at Rest and increasingly recognized as an optimal method for protecting Data in Use. There have been multiple projects to encrypt memory. Microsoft Xbox systems are designed to provide memory encryption and the company PrivateCore presently has a commercial software product vCage to provide attestation along with full memory encryption for x86 servers.GCN, John Moore, March 12, 2014:\\"How to lock down data in use -- and in the cloud\\" Several papers have been published highlighting the availability of security-enhanced x86 and ARM commodity processors.M. Henson and S. Taylor \\"Beyond full disk encryption:protection on security-enhanced commodity processors\\", \\"Proceedings of the 11th international conference on applied cryptography and network security\\", 2013M. Henson and S. Taylor \\"Memory encryption: a survey of existing techniques\\", \\"ACM Computing Surveys volume 46 issue 4\\", 2014 In that work, an ARM Cortex-A8 processor is used as the substrate on which a full memory encryption solution is built. Process segments (for example, stack, code or heap) can be encrypted individually or in composition. This work marks the first full memory encryption implementation on a mobile general-purpose commodity processor. The system provides both confidentiality and integrity protections of code and data which are encrypted everywhere outside the CPU boundary. For x86 systems, AMD has a Secure Memory Encryption (SME) feature introduced in 2017 with Epyc. Intel has promised to deliver its Total Memory Encryption (TME) feature in an upcoming CPU.  CPU-based key storage  Operating system kernel patches such as TRESOR and Loop-Amnesia modify the operating system so that CPU registers can be used to store encryption keys and avoid holding encryption keys in RAM. While this approach is not general purpose and does not protect all data in use, it does protect against cold boot attacks. Encryption keys are held inside the CPU rather than in RAM so that data at rest encryption keys are protected against attacks that might compromise encryption keys in memory.  Enclaves  Enclaves enable an ‚Äúenclave‚Äù to be secured with encryption in RAM so that enclave data is encrypted while in RAM but available as clear text inside the CPU and CPU cache. Intel Corporation has introduced the concept of ‚Äúenclaves‚Äù as part of its Software Guard Extensions. Intel revealed an architecture combining software and CPU hardware in technical papers published in 2013.  Cryptographic protocols  Several cryptographic tools, including secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems. Data in use could be operated upon while encrypted and never exposed to the system doing the processing.  See also * Also see Alternative Definition section of Data At Rest * Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts. * Zero-knowledge proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. * Secure multi-party computation is a method for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. * Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZKs) are zero-knowledge proofs that require no interaction between the prover and verifier. * Format- preserving encryption (FPE), refers to encrypting in such a way that the output (the ciphertext) is in the same format as the input (the plaintext) * Blinding is a cryptography technique by which an agent can provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output. * Example privacy-enhancing technologies References Category:Computer data Category:Cryptography ","title":"Data in use"},{"id":"41047049","text":"The 4th World Sports Acrobatics Championships were held in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, in 1980.

In 1599 she settled with her husband and children in Buenos Aires. She was one of the most distinguished women in the R√≠o de la Plata, in the early 17th century, owns of luxury homes, farms and vineyards. His family belonged to illustrious Portuguese lineages, including her royal ancestry through her great-great grandmother, Dona Beatriz de Meneses, 2nd Countess of Loul√©. She and her husband were the ancestors of Argentine politicians and military, among them Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, President of the Argentine Republic between 1922 and 1928.  Biography  Azores Islands Margarida was born in Santa Maria Island, the daughter of Matias Nunes Cabral and Maria Sim√µes de Melo, belonging to a noble Portuguese family. She was married to Amador Vaz de Alpoim, son of Estevan de Alpoim and Isabel Velha. She and her family arrived in Buenos Aires from Rio de Janeiro, where they had lived for five years. Margarida Cabral de Melo and her sister In√™s Nunes Cabral (wife of Gil Gon√ßalves de Moura) were the first women to have political and economic influence in the R√≠o de la Plata. Margarida was perhaps the richest woman in Buenos Aires towards the beginning of 1600. She possessed one of the most luxurious houses in the city, with mahogany furniture, carved silverware, tapestry and among its jewelry, a gold parrot. The house of the family Cabral de Alpoim was located at the intersection of the streets Victoria and Balcarce, current neighborhood of Monserrat. Margarida and her family were linked to the beginnings of cattle raising (cimarron cattle) in the current Argentine territory. She was the owner of a ranch located in the town of Luj√°n, which was managed by her son Manuel Cabral de Alpoim. Her husband passed away in 1617 being buried in the city. He had rendered military services to the Spanish Empire, taking part in some military expeditions led by Hernando Arias de Saavedra. She had many sons and daughters, including General Amador B√°ez de Alpoim, who served as mayor of Buenos Aires, lieutenant governor of Santa Fe and Corrientes, and Mat√≠as Cabral de Melo y Alpoim (1593-1645) a well-known presbyter of Buenos Aires.  Ancestors and descendants  Belmonte Castle, belonging to the Cabral lineage Margarita Cabral de Melo and his sister were relatives of Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, discoverer of Brazil and Gon√ßalo Velho Cabral, discoverer of Azores. His most notorious ancestors were √Ålvaro Martins Homem 3¬∞Captain of Praia, and Jo√£o Fernandes de Andrade, possibly a descendant of Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall. It is proven that his family descended by several genealogical lines of the kings of Portugal, including Afonso III and John I of Portugal. Through these royal ancestors, their lineage is linked to the House of Plantagenet and Castile. She and her sister were the ancestors of various historical figures linked to the politics and culture of the R√≠o de la Plata like Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of the province of Buenos Aires between 1835 and 1852, and Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, first President of the Argentine Confederation. Other famous descendants of this family include Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, a Uruguayan patriot who participated in the War of Independence, and Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, a military and politician who served as Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata in 1815. His sister In√©s N√∫√±ez Cabral and Gil Gon√ßalves de Moura were the ancestors of the writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges.

The 244th episode of the series overall, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 13, 2013. The episode is the first of a three-episode story arc, which continues with \\"A Song of Ass and Fire\\", and concludes with \\"Titties and Dragons\\". The plot, which employs themes and motifs from the TV series Game of Thrones, concerns the characters' anticipation of a Black Friday sale, with Randy Marsh taking a temporary job as a mall security guard to gain an advantage over the holiday shopping crowds, and the children of South Park split into two factions over whether to collectively purchase bargain-priced Xbox One or PlayStation 4 video game consoles to facilitate their online group gaming. This episode was submitted for, and received, a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour) at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards. The episode was rated TV-MA- LSV in the United States. Plot The security management at South Park Mall briefs its guards on the upcoming Black Friday shopping day. The security Captain, a grizzled veteran with a large scar running down his face, tells the guards that this year, the mall is offering an 80% discount to the first 30 people in the mall, which is certain to again incite violence among shoppers. Among the guards is Randy Marsh, who has taken the temporary job not to earn extra holiday money as he says, but to acquire the discounts ahead of the crowds that will camp outside the mall. Meanwhile, the boys of South Park are dressed in medieval garb while engaging in role playing inspired by Game of Thrones, and are themselves anticipating Black Friday. Cartman informs his classmates of the 80% discount, and says if they work together, they can all purchase one of the new gaming systems so that they can play online games together. The children, however, become split over whether to purchase Xbox Ones or PlayStation 4s. Kyle and Stan find themselves on opposite sides of the schism, with Kyle allied with Cartman's Xbox One faction, and Stan on the PS4 side. The two factions then begin recruiting other children to increase their ranks. Cartman, strolling through the \\"Garden of Andros\\" with Kenny, whose character is \\"Lady McCormick\\", tells him that they are only recruiting Xbox One loyalists to help them get inside the mall so they both can get cheap Xbox Ones. He wants Kenny to use his influence to \\"take care\\" of Kyle, should his loyalty to their faction falter. The garden is then revealed to be the elaborately landscaped back yard of an elderly South Park resident, who orders the children to stop trespassing on his property. This gag recurs throughout the three-part storyline, with Cartman playing different participants in the conflict against each other, only for the old man to inform them of this from his window, much to Cartman's irritation. The mall's security is further daunted by the news that a new Tickle Me Elmo called \\"Stop Touching Me Elmo\\" is being released in time for Black Friday, which leads to shoppers camping outside even earlier than anticipated. The head of Sony has also announced a special bundle to help entice customers to side with PS4. To address increasing crowds, the mall's security tries to hand out wristbands so shoppers can hold places in line, but this leads to a brawl in which the Captain is fatally stabbed. Cradling his dying superior, Randy reveals his true motives for having taken the job. The Captain notes that Randy now knows how serious Black Friday is, and peels off the scar over his left eye, revealing it to be a prosthetic appliance. Before dying, he places it on Randy's face, telling Randy that regardless of his early motives, he is the Captain now, and must now protect the town. Inspired by the new responsibility, Randy tells his fellow guards that they now have work to do. At the same time, Stan rallies his assembled army, telling them that Lady McCormick has joined them to make sure that the winner of the console war is the PS4. Production From the beginning of season seventeen's production cycle, South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to ensure that there was a two- or three-part storyline somewhere in this season because they have always enjoyed doing them as they allow for a different style of writing. They decided to actually start a multiple-episode storyline with this episode after coming off \\"Ginger Cow\\", which they felt could have easily been expanded into two or three episodes. The fact that \\"Ginger Cow\\" unfortunately had to be compressed into the standard length of an episode left Parker and Stone wanting to doing something bigger even more. With four episodes left to be produced for this season, Parker and Stone contemplated making a four-part storyline but wrapped it up at three. As for what the three-part storyline would be about, Parker and Stone said that they had been talking about doing a Game of Thrones-themed episode for a long time since they both watched the show and found many things to satirize. Butters' scenes in the three episodes which centered on his understanding of Game of Thrones were the first jokes that were visualized by Parker and Stone as being one of the running gags; they also helped solidify Game of Thrones role in the plot. Once they decided to center the episodes around Black Friday, the Game of Thrones angle became a great way to tie both stories together as Parker and Stone felt Black Friday was something that would really fit well in Game of Thrones. They soon felt that they were onto a big idea that would be received well by audiences. Before the Game of Thrones and Black Friday elements became part of the episode, the original premise of the storyline was focused on the large amount of cut content from South Park: The Stick of Truth, a video game which Parker and Stone were heavily involved in the development of. However, as the episode became more and more focused on Game of Thrones and Black Friday, the aspects which were lifted from the game were almost entirely scrapped. Reception \\"Black Friday\\" received critical acclaim. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a score of 8.7 out of 10, writing: \\"Cleverly fusing elements of the Next-Gen Console War with HBO's Game of Thrones, 'Black Friday' was easily one of the best South Park episodes we've seen in Season 17.\\" Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí, praising the Game of Thrones parody, saying, \\"Why wrap Game of Thrones in all this? There's no real reason to do so, except that it's really amusing and offers up a great way to frame the overall narrative. What makes the approach really work is that 'Black Friday' is not a one-for-one parody so much as a thematic one.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Black Friday\\" Full episode at South Park Studios. \\"Episode 1707 \\"Black Friday\\" Press Release\\".

In the 1970s and 1980s the club was considered the main rival to Gilley's Club across town in Pasadena. The Esquire Ballroom closed in 1995 and remained unused for a number of years. The nightclub reopened as Neon Boots Dancehall & Saloon in August 2013 as the largest gay country and western genre bar in the Southern United States, the second largest gay bar in the state of Texas, and largest gay bar in Houston. It continues to host music acts on the same stage that it used as the Esquire Ballroom. The venue has a significant heterosexual and mainstream following as well. On March 28, 2014, USA Today named Neon Boots one of the top ten dance halls in Texas in their \\"10 Great Places\\" series. Willie Nelson After his son Billy was born in 1958, Willie Nelson and his family moved to Houston. On the way, Nelson stopped by the Esquire Ballroom to sell his original songs to house band singer Larry Butler. Butler refused to purchase the song \\"Mr. Record Man\\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a six-night job singing in the club and a $50 loan to rent an apartment. Nelson rented an apartment near Houston, in Pasadena, Texas, where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disk jockey. Nelson was inspired to write the song \\"Night Life\\" during one of his trips from his home in Pasadena to his work, singing at the Esquire. Due to financial issues, Nelson sold the song to guitar instructor Paul Buskirk for $150. The song was rejected by Pappy Daily, who made Nelson's studio recordings at the time. Daily believed that the song was not country. Due to the amount of money that Nelson received for the song, he decided to record the song in another studio. To avoid legal actions, it was recorded as \\"Nite Life\\" under the artist name of \\"Hugh Nelson and Paul Buskirk and the Little Men\\".

In 2014, there were 200 pawnbrokers in Hong Kong, with the number increasing over the next several years. Pawn shops are some of the oldest businesses in Hong Kong. The pawn shops themselves have several prominent features, including a screen to block the view of passersby, as well as a high counter. Additionally, these shops are governed by strict regulations, such as having to keep records of all transactions and being obliged to report any suspicious items to the authorities.  History  There have been pawnbrokers in Hong Kong for over 200 years. According to the Guangdong Annals, there were 16 pawnbrokers in 1821 - the oldest of them was Jeun Yun Aat ().https://hk.history.museum/documents/54401/54616/Sen_02_full.pdf In 1837, the Yuen Long bazaar had its market days on the third, sixth, and ninth days of each month of the lunar calendar - discounts on those days were common. In 1926, the Hong Kong government strengthened its regulations on pawnshops and drafted pawn legislation. Since then, pawnbrokers are required to operate as licensed establishments.The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers‚Äô Association Limited. http://www.pawn.com.hk/?mod=site_pawn_assoc_history. Extracted on 04 November 2013 As a result, the industry's appeal was widened. The activities of the pawnbrokers were limited by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in the Second World War. In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use Japanese military yen as a medium of exchange. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, their currency was considered to be useless, and many people went to a pawnbroker to obtain some native currency for use in their daily transactions. To ensure that money was circulated, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawnbroking industry to revive itself; with government support, the Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was established in 1947 - at the time, there were only 11 members. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. As of 2013, the Association has more than 161 members; combined with non-member pawnshops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawnshops are mainly located on Hong Kong Island, particularly Central and Kowloon. Because of this, and because many jewelry and goldsmith shops are located in Central, mortgage and loan facilities are more commonly found there than anywhere else in Hong Kong.ÊñºÂΩ•Âåó.

The screen is tall enough to block passers-by from seeing inside. Clients can be concealed by the board to avoid recognition.  Pawning counter  The counter of the pawnshop, which is behind the tall board, is typically taller than the average person. There are window frames in the counter. Clients need to hand over their mortgaged properties at the pawning counter. This design is meant to emphasize the superior status of the pawnbroker in the transaction. Another reason for setting a high counter is for security, as it is hard for passers-by and clients to see the environment and workers inside the pawnshop.  Names of pawnshops  Ze Cau Baan Pawnshops are considered to be a traditional industry in China. The majority of the shops use names including words meaning harmonious (for example 'tung' (Âêå), 'wo' (Âíå)) and/or prosperous (for example 'chang' (Êòå), 'fat' (Áôº), 'fung' (Ë±ê)).

The Zingari was an early weekly newspaper of the Cape Colony, which printed in Cape Town from 1870 until 1875. It was a low-brow, semi-humorous paper that never attained a wide circulation, but was notable for featuring some of the first satirical cartoons in southern Africa. It was also an overtly pro-imperialist publication, appealing to the right-wing of the political spectrum of the time. Publication Cartoon attacking Mr John Quin, one of the many local politician who converted to the movement for Responsible Government. The Zingari was founded by Charles Cowen, who was to be the newspaper's editor for the duration of its publication. The first run was beset with technical problems, and only 300 copies were printed. Cowen therefore approached the large and established printing house of Saul Solomon, the owner of the mainstream Cape Argus newspaper. Solomon permitted the use of his printing house though, as a liberal MP himself, he was often the main figure attacked by the Zingari in its sketches and columns. The name, \\"Zingari\\", is a dialectal Italian word meaning \\"Gypsies\\", but in its sketches the paper always represented itself with the character of a medieval jester. Political stance The Zingari took a strongly reactionary, pro-imperialist stance, in opposition to the mainstream newspapers such as the Cape Argus and The South African Commercial Advertiser (which both tended to favour local self-government and an expansion of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise). It was one of the few publications which opposed the movement for \\"Responsible Government\\" (locally elected democracy) which it accused of being \\"crafts and assaults of the devil\\" which would bring about a \\"great conflagration\\".The Zingari. Friday 9 June 1871, p.94. When the movement's leader came to power in 1872, the Zingari became one of the most extreme voices of opposition against the local government, and in favour of a stronger British imperial presence in southern Africa.A.Mason: What's So Funny?: Under the Skin of South African Cartooning.

The railroad became known throughout the area for its crookedness and later became a tourist attraction. It ran from Rapid City to Mystic for a distance of 36.043 miles. The railroad ceased operations in 1947. Naming Though the official name is the Rapid City, Black Hills and Western Railroad, many sources refer to it as simply the Black Hills and Western Railroad. It is also called the Crouch Line, in honor of its founder, C.D. Crouch. Through the years, the line's name varied as it switched owners. These names were as follows: Dakota & Wyoming Railroad; Missouri River & North Western Railroad; Dakota, Western & Missouri River Railroad; Dakota, Wyoming and Western Railroad; Dakota Pacific Railroad; Dakota, Wyoming & Missouri River Railroad; Black Hills & Missouri River Railroad; and Black Hills & Wyoming Railroad. History The Crouch Line was one of many railroads in the Black Hills that experienced the area's boom and bust. Most of these early railroads were short-lived, and the main reason for the failures was flash flooding. The Crouch Line entered the planning stages in the early 1890s, with the purpose of connecting Rapid City to the central Black Hills. The initial line from Rapid City to Dark Canyon was completed in 1893. In 1896, C.D. Crouch raised money to extend the line to Mystic. Crouch also hoped to later extend the line into Wyoming and to the Missouri River. Construction on the line from Dark Canyon to Mystic began in 1901 and was completed in 1906, and a celebration was held on May 27, 1906. In June 1907, a flood wiped out a small portion of the line, but by late 1907, the railroad had been repaired. During the night of November 15, 1907, a bridge in a narrow gorge located north of Silver City caught fire as a train approached. Engineer Almore Harper could not stop the train; it is speculated that he jumped before the wreck. The fireman was killed, but both Harper and the conductor survived. A few of the rear cars stayed on the track, while the rest of the train fell into the creek below. The train had been hauling coal from Sheridan, Wyoming to Rapid City, and 3 cars of coal ignited shortly after the wreck. The railroad received a widespread reputation for its crookedness; it was once called the \\"crookedest line in the world\\", and some accounts claimed that there were bends in the line that allowed the engineer and brakeman in the caboose to shake hands. Some rails were specially manufactured to be bent before they were placed, in order to fit the bends. 105 bridges were built over Rapid Creek in only 26 miles. From 1910 to 1913, the line flourished, hauling Wyoming coal. On June 30, 1917, the railroad had 3 steam locomotives, 3 passenger cars, 7 pieces of work equipment, and 8 freight cars. There were about 32.4 miles of track on the main line and another 4.7 miles of sidings and yard tracks. No property had been constructed by the line. By 1920, the railroad was having significant financial difficulties, but local businessman and politician James Halley II helped the railroad continue operations. By 1940, it had evolved solely into a tourist attraction, offering ride tours for as much as $2.70 per person. The Crouch Line was the longest-lasting of its kind in the Black Hills, operating until 1946. Most of the railroad has been taken up or destroyed, especially after the 1972 Black Hills flood. The portion of the route that ran from Pactola to Mystic has been converted into a hiking trail, which starts at Silver City. In summer 2013, the Crouch Line was featured in an exhibit in the Adelstein Gallery in The Journey Museum in Rapid City. Route The railroad started on the west side of Rapid City, South Dakota. It continued along the north shore of Canyon Lake and ran up Rapid Canyon through Johnson Siding, Hisega, Big Bend, and Canyon City. From there, it ran to Pactola (which is now submerged under Pactola Lake) and on to Silver City, and followed Rapid Creek to its final stop at Mystic. There, it connected to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, which ran north towards Deadwood, Lead, and Spearfish Canyon and south towards Hill City; the Chicago & Northwestern Railway; and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad. The present-day South Dakota Highway 44 closely follows the old path of the Crouch Line. US 385 crosses over the old path at Pactola Lake.

It was established by Phillip Frazer, Bruce Hanford, and Jon Hawkes. Notable contributors included Ron Cobb, Ian McCausland, Bob Daly, Patrick Cook, Beatrice Faust, Ponch Hawkes, Helen Garner, Michael Leunig, Anne Summers, Neil McLean, and Phil Pinder. The headquarters was in Carlton, Victoria. With Frazer as the common thread,The Digger was produced by a frequently changing collective‚Äîincluding Bruce Hanford, Helen Garner, Ponch Hawkes, Jenny (Jewel) Brown, Colin Talbot, Garrie Hutchinson, Virginia Fraser, Hall Greenland, Grant Evans, and Michael Zerman in the Sydney office‚Äîuntil December 1975, when it folded under the weight of too little money and too many lawsuits: a libel suit from Builders Labourers union boss Norm Gallagher, another filed by the head of the South Australian Police, and an obscenity case brought by the State of Victoria for Helen Garner's article describing a sex-education class. Frazer left Australia for the United States in July 1976, and has been a publisher, editor, and writer in both countries ever since. Frazer's blog coorabellridge.com includes numerous posts of articles and graphics from The Digger archive. Helen Garner wrote an October 1972 essay article for The Digger under a pen name, in which she chronicled a spontaneous sex education lesson she gave to her 13-year-old students while working as a teacher at Fitzroy High School. In the article, Garner revealed that she had intended to give a lesson on Ancient Greece, but the textbooks given to her students had been defaced with sexually explicit imagery. As a result of those images, the class posed questions relating to sex to Garner, who decided to allow an uninhibited discussion based on their questions, which she vowed to answer accurately. When her identity was revealed, she was called into the Victorian Department of Education and fired on the spot. The case was widely publicised in Melbourne, bringing Garner a degree of notoriety. Her colleagues, along with members of the Victorian Secondary Teachers Association, went on strike in protest at the Deputy Director of Secondary Education's decision to fire Garner. As a result of her dismissal as a teacher, she began writing, and published the cult classic novel Monkey Grip six years later, which established her writing career.

History In summer 1975, Doctors Caesar Somoso and Anita Somoso (couple) first established a family clinic through a rented 2-storey, 2 door apartments and set up a 10-bed medical clinic. At the start the facility can offer basic laboratory services (X-ray, blood examination, urinalysis, fecalysis) and primary health care. It was named as Clinica Somoso. Six months after the establishment of Clinica Somoso, Philippines Social Security System has recognized and accredited the clinic with Medicare privileges. This made Clinica Somoso as the first lying-in hospital in Panabo community. After one year of operation, Clinica Somoso increased its bed capacity to 25 because of high demands of medical services in the community and people recognized that they need not to go to Davao City or Tagum, Davao del Norte for their health needs and or confinements knowing they can be diagnosed and treated well in Clinica Somoso. Two years after the 25 bed capacity was approved, Clinica Somoso applied for a secondary level licensure which was again approved by Department of Health / Medicare so again, the Clinica Somoso became the first secondary hospital in Panabo, Davao del Norte.Somoso General Hospital History , .

Fontana and Jean Grugel, ‚ÄúThe Politics of Indigenous Participation Through ‚Äò‚ÄòFree Prior Informed Consent‚Äù: Reflections from the Bolivian Case‚Äù (2016) 77 World Development 249-261 at 1 Indigenous people have a special connection to their land and resources, and they inhabit one-fifth of the earth's surface. These areas are environmentally rich in both renewable and non-renewable resources.United Nations Division of Social Policy and Development indigenous peoples, ‚ÄúEnvironment‚Äô https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/thematic- issues/environment.html The collective ownership style of most indigenous peoples conflicts with the modern global market and its continuous need for resources and land. To protect indigenous peoples rights, international human rights law has created processes and standards to safeguard their way of life and to encourage participation in the decision-making process. One of these methods is the process of FPIC. There is criticism that many international conventions and treaties only require consultation and not consent, which is a much higher threshold. Without the requirement for consent, indigenous people are not able to veto government projects and developments in their area, which directly affects their lives and cultures. FPIC allows indigenous peoples to have the right to self-determination and self-governance in national and local government decision-making processes over projects that concern their lives and resources. Examples include natural resource management, economic development, uses of traditional knowledge, genetic resources, health care, and education.  Interpretation = Definition  The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation has defined the concept of Free Prior Informed Consent as the following: *Firstly Free simply means that there is no manipulation or coercion of the Indigenous People and that the process is self-directed by those affected by the project. *Secondly Prior implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance of any activities being either commenced or authorised, and time for the consultation process to occur must be guaranteed by the relative agents. *Informed suggests that the relevant Indigenous people receive satisfactory information on the key points of the project such as the nature, size, pace, reversibility, the scope of the project, the reason for it, and its duration. This is the more difficult term of the four, as different groups may find certain information more relevant. The Indigenous People should also have access to the primary reports on the economic, environmental cultural impact that the project will have. The language used must be able to be understood by the indigenous peoples. *The source does not define Consent. It is granted or withheld after a process that involves consultation and participation. However, mere consultation by itself is not a substitute for actual consent. The UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights notes that indigenous peoples \\"should determine autonomously how they define and establish consent\\". The UNPFII requires that Indigenous People should be consulted in a way which is appropriate for their customs. This means that not every member will have to agree. This has been criticised by some [women's rights] groups. The Indigenous People will determine who is to be consulted and must effectively communicate this with the Government and Developers. It is the duty of the state to make sure that FPIC has been carried out, if it has not then it is their issue to redress, not the company or the people wishing to carry out the project.Parshuram Tamang, \\"An Overview of the Principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent and Indigenous Peoples in International and Domestic Law and Practices\\", (2005) United Nations Workshop on Free Prior informed Consent The International Labour Organization requires that consultation takes place in a climate of mutual trust and circumstances are considered appropriate if they create favourable conditions for reaching agreement and consent. In a pilot study by the UN-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation UN-REDD of FPIC application in Vietnam the following steps were required: (1) preparation, (2) Consultation with local officials (3) Recruitment of Local Facilitators (4) Training of the local facilitators, (5) awareness raising (6) Village Meeting (7) recording the decision (8) Reporting to UN-REDD Vietnam (9) Verification and evaluation. The majority of issues with this policy was the recruitment of the Local Facilitators, while they were able to discuss the process in a language that Indigenous Peoples understood there was mistrust towards them and a fear that they had been bribed.Eric J. Jokela ‚ÄúAdapting Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) Local Contexts in REDD+: Lessons from three Experiments in Vietnam‚Äù (2015) Forests at 6  International development  The principle of FPIC within international development is most clearly stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Article 10 states: > \\"Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or > territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and > informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on > just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return. \\" Articles 11, 19, 28, and 29 of the declaration also explicitly use the term. It is further established in international conventions, notably the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Countries including Peru, Australia, and the Philippines have included FPIC in their national law.  International law  The role of indigenous peoples' FPIC in decisions about infrastructure or extractive industries developed on their ancestral domain is an issue within international law. Projects lacking FPIC are called development aggression by indigenous peoples. The issue of indigenous peoples' lack of access to accountability and grievance mechanisms to address human rights violations has been formally raised with the United Nations Human Rights Council. Asian Indigenous peoples have urged the UN to address this before the economic integration of ASEAN in 2015, given the human rights records of member states such as Myanmar and Laos, which are among the world's most repressive societies. International Labour Organization The International Labour Organization (ILO) has been working with indigenous people since the 1920s, it currently has 187 member states, including New Zealand. ILO Convention 169 (the Convention) on Indigenous and tribal peoples is an international treaty adopted by the ILO in 1989. The Convention aims to overcome discriminatory practices affecting Indigenous People and enable them in the decision making process. The fundamental foundations of the Convention are participation and consultation. The requirement for consultation falls upon the Government of the state and not on private persons or companies, this may be delegated but ultimately the responsibility rests on the government.ILO, 'Understanding the Indigenous and Tribal People Convention, 1989 (No. 169)\\" (2013) http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---normes/documents/publication/wcms_205225.pdf The need for consultation of IPs is written throughout the Convention a number of times and is referred to in : Articles 6, 7, 16 and 22. Article 6(1) states that governments should: > ‚ÄúConsult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in > particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration > is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect > them directly\\" ' Article 6 (2) states that this consultation will be carried out in good faith and in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances. The aim of this consultation process is to achieve an agreement or consent to the purposed development.Article 6(2) ILO, Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169 The Convention does not allow Indigenous People to veto any developments; the condition is for mere consultation not consent. The supervisor bodies of the ILO have stated that the consultation process cannot only be information sharing that there must be a chance for the Indigenous People to influence the decision making process. If consent is not achieved the nation-state must still respect other areas of the convention that include the Indigenous peoples right to their lands. Such as Article 16 (2) requires that free informed consent must be given where is the relocation of people.Article 16 (2) ILO Indigenous and Tribal peoples Convention No.169 The treaty is legally binding on all states that ratify it, if a state chooses to ratify they may need to adjust domestic legislation. In nations such as NZ domestic legislation such as the Resource Management Act 1991 refers to the need to consider in developments Maori relationship with land and water sites.s7 Resource Management Act 1991 This spiritual and practical connection that Maori have to the land has been considered in a number cases before the court including the supreme court case of Paki v Attorney General.Paki v Attorney General [2014] NZSC 118 United Nations The United Nations describes FPIC both directly and indirectly in numerous conventions and treaties. One of the most direct is located in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Article 19 states: > \\"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous > Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to > obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and > implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect > them.Article 19, United Nations, Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples > , (2008) ‚Äù Article 32 of UNDRIP requires that consultation is carried out with Indigenous Peoples before states can undertake projects that will affect Indigenous People Rights to land, territory and resources Article 32 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples The above Articles only requires Consultation, however Article 10 requires that there is informed consent before the relocation Indigenous Peoples from their land.Article 19 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples This allows Indigenous People the right to decide where they live and gives them the power stop any development which they disagree with. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is the most universally accepted standard of Human Rights. It does not directly mention FPIC but it does express the importance of Self- determination of all Peoples in Article 1. Article 7 declares that all are equal before the law, this means that one person has no more right to another in a nation, this is further endorsed by Article 17 which states that every person has the right to own property and that he shall not be arbitrary deprived of his property.Article 7, 10 and 17, United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights The right for Self-determination is further protected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), in Article 1 of both Documents. This includes economic self-determination, which for many IP is the control of their natural resources. The ICCPR in Article 27 states that minorities shall not be denied access to their culture, in the Human Rights Committee (HRC) in General Comment 23, have found this meaning to include the right of Indigenous People to their land and resources. The HRC has interpreted this to mean that states have a positive duty to engage with IP prior to any development or granting of resource concession in IP lands.Tara Ward, \\"The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law\\" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 7 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the supervisory body of the ICESCR, has even stated in their general comment No.23 that if Indigenous People's land has been taken without informed prior consent then they have the right to restitution or the return of their land or resources. This comes from their interpretation of Article 15 of the ICESCR . Article 15 protects Indigenous People's right to participate in their cultural life. The Comment by the CESCR is important as it goes beyond mere consultation. The need for FPIC has also been called upon by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) which requires that no state shall make a decision concerning the rights of IPs without their consent. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) encourages Indigenous Peoples participation in decision making. However these are not legally binding decisions, only recommendations Tara Ward, \\"The Right to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: Indigenous Peoples' Participation Rights within International Law\\" (2011) 10 Northwestern Journal of International Human Rights at 57  World Bank  The World Bank was one of the first multilateral financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights of Indigenous People's in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures of Indigenous People. Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation of Indigenous People and was a statement on the need to protect Indigenous People's. Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation of Indigenous People in the consultation process. The subsequent World Bank Policy on indigenous peoples was released in 2005, OP 4.10 focused on the reduction of poverty. In doing so the bank identified the intrinsic link that Indigenous People have with the land and the need for a consultation process which fully respects the human rights, human dignity, economics and culture of the people involved. The Bank stated that it will not lend money to a state or company unless there has been Free Prior Informed Consultation with the local Indigenous Population and that there is broad community support for the development.World Bank, Operational Policy 4.10 (2005) Critics have questioned why the term \\"consultation\\" has been used as opposed to consent. Stating that it means IP are not able to decline a project if they do not agree with it. Furthermore, \\"community\\" is an ambiguous term.Mauro Barelli ‚Äú Free Prior and informed consent in the aftermath of the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous Peoples: Developments and Challenges ahead‚Äù (2012) 16 The International Journal of Human Rights 1 at 5 In August 2016 the World Bank adopted its new Environmental and Social Standards, including Environmental and Social Standard 7 (ESS7) on Indigenous Peoples/Sub-Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities (indigenous peoples, \\"IPs\\"), which requires Free Prior Informed Consent if the project will: * have adverse impacts on land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; * cause relocation of IPs from land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; or * have significant impacts on IPs cultural heritage that is material to the identity and/or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual aspects of the affected IPs‚Äô lives.  Indigenous Peoples' FPIC protocols  Since the early 2000s, indigenous peoples have started developing their own protocols on how FPIC processes are to be carried out. The first protocols were sector specific, namely Canadian First Nations addressing the country's mining companies, the second wave of protocols were so-called bio-cultural protocols developed by indigenous peoples i.a. in Asia and Africa in connection with the implementation of Article 8j on Access and Benefit Sharing of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The third generation are so-called autonomous FPIC protocols that have predominantly been developed by indigenous peoples in Latin American countries, such as the Wampis in Peru, the Juruna in Brazil or the Embera Chami in Colombia, whose states have, despite ratifying ILO Convention 169, adopted regulations that fall far short of FPIC as defined in international law.  Climate change negotiations  During the UNFCCC climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), it was noted that the United Nations General Assembly had adopted UNDRIP, meaning that the Declaration and its FPIC provision applied to the negotiations.UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Appendix I, paragraph 2, sub (C) This reference was made in the context of a so-called safeguard for REDD+, specifically the instruction to have \\"respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities\\" when undertaking REDD+ activities. Following this, FPIC has been widely applied for demonstration projects on REDD+, particularly after the United Nations REDD Programme published a report on its efforts to develop a methodology for FPIC for REDD+ in the case of its country program in Vietnam. Early in 2013, the global United Nations REDD Programme issued guidelines for the application of FPIC, including an analysis of jurisprudence on FPIC in various contexts, that are mandatory for all UN-REDD country programmes. National legislation Some countries have incorporated FPIC into national legislation,starting with the Philippine Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997. Bolivia Bolivia ratified ILO Convention 169 and in 2007 it also formally incorporated UNDRIP into its municipal law. In 2009 the nation also included the duty to consult Indigenous People's in its constitution, this is however a much less radical version of the draft, which required that consent be given for the exploration of all resource activities. These legal requirements are very significant in a nation that has a wealth of natural resources and a large Indigenous Population. The risk of giving Indigenous People this type of power to veto government projects is an increase social conflict in certain regions. This was seen with the conflict surrounding the Isiboro Se¬¥cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). A road was planned through the Park, coca growers were in favour of the project as it would expand their business. The Indigenous Population however opposed the idea, saying that consent should be needed for mega development in Indigenous Peoples territories. The result was large protests in La Paz. The fear was of damage to the vital river system, illegal logging and altering habitats of endangered animals in the area.Jean Friedman-Rudovsky, 'In Bolivia, A Battle Over A Highway and a Way of Life' (2012) Environment 360 http://e360.yale.edu/feature/in_bolivia_a_battle_over_a_highway_and_a_way_of_life/2566/ The state engaged in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples, but this amplified the problem, with activists critiquing the governments lack of legal framework to protect Indigenous People. The government claimed that the expectations of the Indigenous People were unrealistic.Lorenza B.

It is a bark beetle, a member of the subfamily Scolytinae. Its common name is the black pine bark beetle. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, including China and Korea. It is known as an introduced species in many other regions, including Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, and South Africa. It is a pest of pines and other trees, and it is widespread in areas where pine trees are cultivated. The species \\"is an important threat to the biosecurity of all forested countries.\\"Hylastes ater. Global Invasive Species Database. ISSG. Description This beetle is cylindrical in shape and 3.5 to 5.5 millimeters long by about 1.4 millimeters wide. It is dark gray or shiny black with reddish antennae and legs. The newly hatched beetle is entirely reddish, and its color darkens over time. The elytra, the front of the face, and most of the prothorax are punctate. The head is bent downward, so just a small part is visible from above. The rostrum is short, not elongated into a typical weevil snout. The whitish egg is less than one millimeter long, and the larva is c-shaped, legless, and white with an amber-colored head capsule. The pupa is \\"mummy-like\\", yellowish-white, and spiny.Hylastes ater. Technical Fact Sheet. Plantwise. CABI. Biology This bark beetle feeds on the developing bark on and around the root crowns of tree seedlings, especially the phloem.Reay, S. D., et al. (2012). Hylastes ater (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) affecting Pinus radiata seedling establishment in New Zealand. Psyche vol. 2012, Article ID 590619, 9 pages. It also infests stumps, logs, and fallen trees. It prefers pines, and is a widespread pest of wild and cultivated Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) in particular. Other recorded host trees include silver fir (Abies alba), colonial pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana), common larch (Larix decidua), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). The beetle reproduces in the inner bark layer of the tree. The female bores an egg gallery up to 13 centimeters in length along the surface of the wood, often parallel to the grain. The male clears the debris from the chamber. After mating, the female lays up to 100 eggs in the gallery, each in its own nook. The larvae usually develop over 8 to 10 weeks, but sometimes take well over a year to reach maturity, depending on temperature. As they grow, the egg gallery is obliterated and they develop together in a common chamber. Pupation lasts up to two weeks. The adult beetle flies well and it can disperse to new areas in the search for appropriate tree hosts. It is attracted to volatiles released by the trees, such as Œ≤-pinene, a component of turpentine.Reay, S. D. and P. J. Walsh. (2002). Relative attractiveness of some volatiles to the introduced pine bark beetles, Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda (Curculionidae: Scolytinae). New Zealand Entomologist 25(1), 51-56. During some parts of the year it may face competition from the red-haired bark beetle (Hylurgus ligniperda), which also reproduces in Monterey pines. As a pest This beetle weakens and kills tree seedlings with its feeding and boring behaviors. It removes sections of bark from the base of the seedling, sometimes killing it. Surviving trees have resin-bleeding lesions and brittle needles and become wilted and discolored.Hylastes ater (black pine bark beetle) Fact Sheet. Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Government of Canada. 2012. Damage to the trees is increased when the beetle acts as a vector for sapstain fungi, introducing them into the wounds. These pigmented fungi discolor wood, producing cosmetic damage that makes it less marketable.Thwaites, J. M., et al. (2005). Survey of potential sapstain fungi on Pinus radiata in New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Botany 43(3), 653-63. This beetle can act as a vector for numerous species of sapstaining fungi in the genus Ophiostoma.Reay, S. D., et al. (2005). A survey of Ophiostoma species vectored by Hylastes ater to pine seedlings in New Zealand. Forest Pathology 35(2), 105-13. A well-studied infestation is occurring in Monterey pine plantations in New Zealand. The beetle was first recorded there in 1929, becoming a minor pest of exotic pines, but recently the severity of its impacts on local pine forestry has become more clear. It is ubiquitous in pine plantings. As mature trees are continually harvested for wood, the many stumps left behind are infested by the beetle, which then spreads to the seedlings. While the beetle has been known to cause high levels of mortality in crops of seedlings in Chile and Australia,Reay, S. D., et al. (2001). The role of the bark beetle, Hylastes ater (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), as a sapstain fungi vector to Pinus radiata seedlings: A crisis for the New Zealand forestry industry? Integrated Pest Management Reviews 6(3-4), 283-91. it does not kill many trees in New Zealand. It more often causes a reduction in wood value by damaging the tree tissue and introducing fungi. Biological pest control efforts using parasitic and predatory insects have been unsuccessful. Early detection of the pest is a priority. Once an infestation is recognized, some methods of chemical control are used. Shipments of logs are fumigated with phosphine, which is a very effective alternative for the ozone-depleting compound methyl bromide.Zhang, Z., et al. (2004). Phosphine as a fumigant to control Hylastes ater and Arhopalus ferus, pests of export logs. New Zealand Plant Protection 57, 257-59. Traps baited with turpentine may also be an option.

Process Aqueous samples, lysed cells, or homogenised tissue are mixed with equal volumes of a phenol:chloroform mixture. This mixture is then centrifuged. Because the phenol:chloroform mixture is immiscible with water, the centrifuge will cause two distinct phases to form: an upper aqueous phase, and a lower organic phase. The aqueous phase rises to the top because it is less dense than the organic phase containing the phenol:chloroform. This difference in density is why phenol, which only has a slightly higher density than water, must be mixed with chloroform to form a mixture with a much higher density than water. The hydrophobic lipids will partition into the lower organic phase, and the proteins will remain at the interphase between the two phases, while the nucleic acids (as well as other contaminants such as salts, sugars, etc.) remain in the upper aqueous phase. The upper aqueous phase can then be pipetted off. Care must be taken to avoid pipetting any of the organic phase or material at the interface. This procedure is often performed multiple times to increase the purity of the DNA. This procedure yields large double stranded DNA that can be used in PCR or RFLP. If the mixture is acidic, DNA will precipitate into the organic phase while RNA remains in the aqueous phase. This is because DNA is more readily neutralized than RNA. There are some disadvantages of this technique in forensic use. It is time-consuming and uses hazardous reagents. Also, because it is a two-step process involving transfer of reagents between tubes, it is at a greater risk of contamination.

The program was initially created for the PDP-11 and LSI-11 series of DEC. At the end of the 1970s it was ported to run on microprocessors like the MOS Technology 6502 of the Apple II and the Intel 8086 of the IBM Personal Computer. The company Meerman Automation took over the development of the package in the early-1980s. The rise of the IBM PC gave TUTSIM its world fame, making scientific simulation software available for researchers all over the world. Failing to meet the demands of a graphical user interface with the rise of Microsoft Windows in the late-1980s the popularity of TUTSIM slowly faded away. Multiple requests from bond graph researchers caused the University of Twente to begin development of a successor to TUTSIM. This resulted in the software 20-sim, released by Controllab, which contained many of the features that made TUTSIM popular.  Use  TUTSIM was an interactive simulation language for continuous dynamical systems. Input had to be given in block diagram form or in bond graph form. The lack of a graphical UI required inputs in textual form by entering commands and arguments. For simulation, fixed step integration methods were provided. Simulation results were displayed in a graphical form or numerically in tables.

Education Wu obtained her bachelor's degree in law from National Taiwan University. ROC Mainland Affairs Council Political Deputy Ministry=Possibility of Ma-Xi meeting On 17 October 2013, Wu said that the possibility of meeting between Ma Ying-jeou and Xi Jinping can only be achieved with the conditions of Leader of Taiwan side must be recognized in his capacity as the President of the Republic of China and that such meeting must be supported by the Taiwanese public. The meeting must also comply with parity and dignity, no matter what the meeting model will be. It must also be held under the condition of nor harming the dignity of the Republic of China, be conductive to the welfare of the Taiwanese and improves cross-strait relations. Cross-strait relations status quo Speaking at a press conference on 31 October 2013, Wu said that most of Taiwanese people support to maintain the status quo on cross-strait relations after a recent survey showed that 71% of Taiwanese support independence from China. Wu said that those people who support independence cannot be simply interpreted as supporting independence. She added that based on the several public opinion polls conducted by the MAC to choose between independence or unification, 80% of the respondents always show the support of maintaining the status quo.

The MAC had communicated with Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) over this matter. TAO response was positive by saying that younger generations should increase contact and engagement to enhance mutual understanding, feelings of familiarity and ethnic identity. Mainland China human rights issues On 23 January 2014, Wu called on Beijing government to rationally handle issues of social justice, judicial integrity and human rights in Mainland China. The statement was made one day after a Chinese mainland activist Xu Zhiyong was tried at court for gathering crowds to disrupt public order. Attracting mainland students to study in Taiwan In mid May 2014, Wu said that Taiwan would improve its education and living conditions for the mainland students to attract more mainland students to come to Taiwan to study so that cross-strait communication could be boosted between young people. She added that Taiwan had eased measures to recruit them, such as recognizing mainland universities and colleges degree, increasing the number of mainland students and streamlining the registration process.

Overview  The strategic position of FB Wilderness enables U.S. and Afghan forces to provide security along the Khost-Gardez Pass, a critical route through the Sulaiman Mountains, which connects downtown Khost to Gardez City. FB Wilderness was first occupied in late 2006 after being built from scratch by elements of 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. Since that time, Wilderness has served as a base of operations for U.S. military elements, Afghan National Army soldiers from 1st Brigade, 203rd ANA Corps, and Afghan regional policemen. During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, the area of the K-G Pass that Wilderness occupies was the site of frequent mujahedeen attacks on convoys including the Battle for Hill 3234. The historically hostile region continues to be a hotbed of activity, especially during the summer months when insurgent forces often target Wilderness with mortars and rockets. In 2007, 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers from 4th Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment and based at FB Wilderness, renamed the firebase to FOB Tellier in honor of their fallen brother, Sergeant Zachary D. Tellier. During a gun battle with insurgent forces in the vicinity of FB Wilderness, SGT Tellier was fatally wounded on Sept. 29, 2007.

It was opened in a series of sections between 1922 and 2012. It commences at Merinda, near Bowen and extends south to North Goonyella coal mine, connecting to the Goonyella railway line. The nearby 13 km line from Kaili to Abbot Point is considered part of the GAP system. History The Bowen Basin is today recognised as the largest coal resource in Australia, but its relative remoteness resulted in a lack of priority for a line that would facilitate development of the coalfield. A line was proposed from Bowen to the 'Bowen Coalfield' in 1884, and funding allocated, but the funds were diverted to the Townsville-Ayr railway line when a surveyor described the coal as 'worthless'.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Booralong Publications 1990 Mining commenced in 1912 at Collinsville, and then in a relatively modest fashion. Coal was being shipped to Townsville and railed to customers due to a lack of efficient transport from Collinsville. The Queensland government was keen to source a local supply of coal for the northern region of the state, and built the line from Merinda, 7 km west of Bowen on the North Coast Line (NCL), 77 km to Collinsville, which opened in 1922. A 7.6 km private tramway (built to QR standard) junctioning from just south of the Collinsville railway station connected to the Scottsville mine opened in the same year, and also served the cattle yards. A 1.5 km spur to the Dacon mine also opened in 1922, and closed in 1983. Coal began to be railed to Mount Isa in the 1930s, a distance of . The line was upgraded in conjunction with the Mount Isa railway line in the 1960s as coal volumes grew in line with the expansion of the Mount Isa mines and smelters, enabling 2,000 ton trains hauled by two main line diesels to be introduced. Newlands extension In 1978, a mine was proposed at Newlands, and in 1984 a 73 km extension opened to serve the mine. At the same time a new export shipping terminal was built at Abbot Point, with a 13 km line to it junctioning at Kaili on the NCL, 8 km west of Merinda. This included a line bypassing Merinda, though the original line remains. The original Collinsville section was rebuilt at the same time and the Scottville line was replaced by a new alignment, the terminal called McNaugton in honour of a former mine manager. The Abbot Point to Newlands section now features 53 kg/m rail on concrete sleepers, a 20 tonne axle load, a 1 in 50 (2%) maximum grade and 240 m minimum radius curves. The maximum speed is 80 km/h. A balloon loop loading facility known as Sonoma was opened 7 km south of Collinsville in 2008. It was built for an axle load of 26.5 tonnes. GAP extension As coal mine development in the Bowen Basin accelerated in the early 2000s, Abbot Point was seen as having available loading capacity that could be used if mines on the Goonyella system could access it. This resulted in the line from Newlands being extended 68 km to North Goonyella coal mine, known as the Goonyella ‚Äì Abbot Point (GAP) project (also sometimes referred to as the Northern Missing Link), opening in 2012. This section was built with 60 kg/m rail, a maximum grade of 1 in 55 (~1.8%), and a maximum axle load of 26.5 tonnes, the same as the Goonyella system. The Newlands line was proposed for electrification in 1983, but that was deferred in 1986 in lieu of the NCL between Caboolture and Gladstone. A review by Aurizon, the private operator of the line, indicates that electrification could be justified if tonnage reaches 70-80Mtpa, current haulage being ~50M tonnes per annum.http://www.aurizon.com.au/Downloads/Aurizon%20Network%20Development%20Plan%202013.pdf See also *Rail transport in Queensland ReferencesExternal links * Map of North Queensland Rail Coal Network * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system * Aurizon website Category:Railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1922 ","title":"GAP line"},{"id":"41047741","text":"Ust-Yansk (; ) is a rural locality (a selo), the only inhabited locality, and the administrative center of Ust-Yansky Rural Okrug of Ust-Yansky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located from Deputatsky, the administrative center of the district.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic Its population as of the 2010 Census was 317,Sakha Republic Territorial Branch of the Federal State Statistics Service.

Description Astropecten duplicatus normally has five long slender, tapering arms which are flattened dorso-ventrally. The aboral (upper) surface has a single row of large marginal plates around the edges of the arms. These are granular, and the two that are closest to the disc each bear a conical spine, although this is often worn away. Other marginal plates and the plates on the oral (lower) surface bear many fine blunt spinules. The tube feet are pointed and have no suckers. Astropecten duplicatus grows to about in diameter. The aboral surface is pale grey or reddish-brown and the oral surface is pale brown or orange. Distribution and habitat Astropecten duplicatus is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from Cape Hatteras, Florida, Cuba and the Bahamas to Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Guyana. It is found on sand or other soft sediments and in seagrass meadows at depths down to about . Biology Astropecten duplicatus spends the day semi-immersed in the sediment on the seabed. It is a carnivore and at night it hunts for bivalve molluscs and gastropods. It transfers its prey to its mouth with its arms, and swallows it whole, later regurgitating any undigested fragments.

In these models, the eddy-viscosity hypothesis is avoided and the individual components of the Reynolds stress tensor are directly computed. These models use the exact Reynolds stress transport equation for their formulation. They account for the directional effects of the Reynolds stresses and the complex interactions in turbulent flows. Reynolds stress models offer significantly better accuracy than eddy-viscosity based turbulence models, while being computationally cheaper than Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulations.  Shortcomings of Eddy-viscosity based models  Eddy-viscosity based models like the k-\\\\epsilon and the k-\\\\omega models have significant shortcomings in complex, real-life turbulent flows. For instance, in flows with streamline curvature, flow separation, flows with zones of re-circulating flow or flows influenced by mean rotational effects, the performance of these models is unsatisfactory. Such one- and two-equation based closures cannot account for the return to isotropy of turbulence, observed in decaying turbulent flows. Eddy-viscosity based models cannot replicate the behaviour of turbulent flows in the Rapid Distortion limit, where the turbulent flow essentially behaves as an elastic medium (instead of viscous).  Reynolds Stress Transport Equation  Reynolds Stress equation models rely on the Reynolds Stress Transport equation. The equation for the transport of kinematic Reynolds stress R_{ij}=\\\\langle u_{i}^\\\\prime u_{j}^\\\\prime\\\\rangle=-\\\\tau _{ij}/\\\\rho is :\\\\frac{DR_{ij}}{Dt} = D_{ij}+ P_{ij}+ \\\\Pi_{ij}+ \\\\Omega_{ij}- \\\\varepsilon_{ij} Rate of change of R_{ij} \\\\+ Transport of R_{ij} by convection = Transport of R_{ij} by diffusion + Rate of production of R_{ij} \\\\+ Transport of R_{ij} due to turbulent pressure-strain interactions + Transport of R_{ij} due to rotation + Rate of dissipation of R_{ij}. The six partial differential equations above represent six independent Reynolds stresses. While the Production term (P_{ij}) is closed and does not require modelling, the other terms, like pressure strain correlation (\\\\Pi_{ij}) and dissipation (\\\\varepsilon_{ij}), are unclosed and require closure models.  Production term  The Production term that is used in CFD computations with Reynolds stress transport equations is :P_{ij} = -\\\\left (R_{im}\\\\frac{\\\\partial U_{j}}{\\\\partial x_{m}}+R_{jm}\\\\frac{\\\\partial U_{i}}{\\\\partial x_{m}}\\\\right ) Physically, the Production term represents the action of the mean velocity gradients working against the Reynolds stresses. This accounts for the transfer of kinetic energy from the mean flow to the fluctuating velocity field. It is responsible for sustaining the turbulence in the flow through this transfer of energy from the large scale mean motions to the small scale fluctuating motions. This is the only term that is closed in the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations. It requires no models for its direct evaluation. All other terms in the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations are unclosed and require closure models for their evaluation.  Rapid Pressure-Strain Correlation term  The rapid pressure-strain correlation term redistributes energy among the Reynolds stresses components. This is dependent on the mean velocity gradient and rotation of the co-ordinate axes. Physically, this arises due to the interaction among the fluctuating velocity field and the mean velocity gradient field. The simplest linear form of the model expression is :\\\\frac{\\\\Pi^{R}_{ij}}{k}=C_2 S_{ij} +C_3 (b_{ik}S_{jk}+b_{jk}S_{ik}-\\\\frac{2}{3}b_{mn}S_{mn}\\\\delta_{ij})+ C_4 (b_{ik}W_{jk} + b_{jk}W_{ik}) Here b_{ij}=\\\\frac{\\\\overline{u_iu_j}}{2k}-\\\\frac{\\\\delta_{ij}}{3} is the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, S_{ij} is the rate of strain term for the mean velocity field and W_{ij} is the rate of rotation term for the mean velocity field. By convention, C_2, C_3, C_4 are the coefficients of the rapid pressure strain correlation model. There are many different models for the rapid pressure strain correlation term that are used in simulations. These include the Launder-Reece-Rodi model, the Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski model, the Hallback- Johanssen model, the Mishra-Girimaji model, besides others.  Slow Pressure- Strain Correlation term  The slow pressure-strain correlation term redistributes energy among the Reynolds stresses. This is responsible for the return to isotropy of decaying turbulence where it redistributes energy to reduce the anisotropy in the Reynolds stresses. Physically, this term is due to the self-interactions amongst the fluctuating field. The model expression for this term is given as :\\\\Pi_{ij}^{S}=-C_{1}\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{k}\\\\left (R_{ij}-\\\\frac{2}{3}k\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\right )-C_{2}\\\\left (P_{ij}-\\\\frac{2}{3}P\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\right ) There are many different models for the slow pressure strain correlation term that are used in simulations. These include the Rotta model , the Speziale-Sarkar model , besides others.  Dissipation term  The traditional modelling of the dissipation rate tensor \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm ij} assumes that the small dissipative eddies are isotropic. In this model the dissipation only affects the normal Reynolds stresses. :\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm ij} = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\varepsilon\\\\delta_{ij} or e_{\\\\rm ij} = 0 where \\\\varepsilon is dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy, \\\\delta_{ij} = 1 when i = j and 0 when i ‚â† j and e_{\\\\rm ij} is the dissipation rate anisostropy defined as e_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_{ij}}{\\\\varepsilon}-\\\\frac{2\\\\delta_{ij}}{3}. However, as has been shown by e.g. Rogallo, Schumann & Patterson, Uberoi, Lee & Reynolds and Groth, Hallb√§ck & Johansson there exist many situations where this simple model of the dissipation rate tensor is insufficient due to the fact that even the small dissipative eddies are anisotropic. To account for this anisotropy in the dissipation rate tensor Rotta proposed a linear model relating the anistropy of the dissipation rate stress tensor to the anisotropy of the stress tensor. :\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm ij} = \\\\frac{2}{3}\\\\varepsilon\\\\delta_{ij} or e_{\\\\rm ij} = \\\\sigma a_{ij} where a_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\overline{u_iu_j}}{k}-\\\\frac{2\\\\delta_{ij}}{3} = 2 b_{ij}. The parameter \\\\sigma is assumed to be a function the turbulent Reynolds number, the mean strain rate etc. Physical considerations imply that \\\\sigma should tend to zero when the turbulent Reynolds number tends to infinity and to unity when the turbulent Reynolds number tends to zero. However, the strong realizability condition implies that \\\\sigma should be identically equal to 1. Based on extensive physical and numerical (DNS and EDQNM) experiments in combination with a strong adherence to fundamental physical and mathematical limitations and boundary conditions Groth, Hallb√§ck and Johansson proposed an improved model for the dissipation rate tensor. :e_{\\\\rm ij} = [1+ \\\\alpha ( \\\\frac{II_{a}}{2} - \\\\frac{2}{3})] a_{ij} - \\\\alpha (a_{\\\\rm ik}a_{\\\\rm kj}-\\\\frac{1}{3}II_{a}\\\\delta_{\\\\rm ij}) where II_{a} = a_{\\\\rm ij}a_{\\\\rm ji} is the second invariant of the tensor a_{\\\\rm ij} and \\\\alpha is a parameter that, in principle, could depend on the turbulent Reynolds number, the mean strain rate parameter etc. However, Groth, Hallb√§ck and Johansson used rapid distortion theory to evaluate the limiting value of \\\\alpha which turns out to be 3/4. Using this value the model was tested in DNS-simulations of four different homogeneous turbulent flows. Even though the parameters in the cubic dissipation rate model were fixed through the use of realizability and RDT prior to the comparisons with the DNS data the agreement between model and data was very good in all four cases. The main difference between this model and the linear one is that each component of e_{\\\\rm ij} is influenced by the complete anisotropic state. The benefit of this cubic model is apparent from the case of an irrotational plane strain in which the streamwise component of a_{\\\\rm ij} is close to zero for moderate strain rates whereas the corresponding component of e_{\\\\rm ij} is not. Such a behaviour cannot be described by a linear model.  Diffusion term  The modelling of diffusion term D_{ij} is based on the assumption that the rate of transport of Reynolds stresses by diffusion is proportional to the gradients of Reynolds stresses. This is an application of the concept of the gradient diffusion hypothesis to modeling the effect of spatial redistribution of the Reynolds stresses due to the fluctuating velocity field. The simplest form of D_{ij} that is followed by commercial CFD codes is :D_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x_{m}}\\\\left (\\\\frac{v_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{k}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial R_{ij}}{\\\\partial x_{m}}\\\\right ) = \\\\operatorname{div} \\\\left (\\\\frac{v_{t}}{\\\\sigma_{k}} abla(R_{ij})\\\\right ) where \\\\upsilon_{t} = C_{\\\\mu} \\\\frac{k^2}{\\\\varepsilon} , \\\\sigma_{k} = 1.0 and C_{\\\\mu} = 0.09.  Rotational term  The rotational term is given as :\\\\Omega_{ij}=-2\\\\omega_{k}\\\\left (R_{jm}e_{ikm}+R_{im}e_{jkm}\\\\right ) here \\\\omega_{k} is the rotation vector, e_{ijk}=1 if i,j,k are in cyclic order and are different,e_{ijk}=-1 if i,j,k are in anti-cyclic order and are different and e_{ijk}=0 in case any two indices are same.  Advantages of RSM  1) Unlike the k-Œµ model which uses an isotropic eddy viscosity, RSM solves all components of the turbulent transport. 2) It is the most general of all turbulence models and works reasonably well for a large number of engineering flows. 3) It requires only the initial and/or boundary conditions to be supplied. 4) Since the production terms need not be modeled, it can selectively damp the stresses due to buoyancy, curvature effects etc. See also *Reynolds Stress *Isotropy *Turbulence Modeling *Eddy *k-epsilon turbulence model See also *k-epsilon turbulence model *Mixing length model ReferencesBibliography *\\"Turbulent Flows\\", S.

Son of the painter and gilder of retablos Juan Luz√°n, Luz√°n married Teresa, daughter of John Zabalo, who was also a painter and designer of altarpieces. Thanks to the patronage of the Pignatelli family, Luz√°n studied in Naples, where he met the Italian Baroque master Giuseppe Mastroleo. He returned to Zaragoza around 1730 to establish an academy, which enjoyed great success. He was named reviewer of paintings by the Spanish Inquisition and in 1741 was appointed by Philip V of Spain as supernumerary painter of the Royal House. The study of the rich collections of the palace allowed him to considerably refine his style. Following on from the gloomy tone of his early works, he acquired a taste for warm coloring, dominating with the yellow, ochre and red in his palette, and lightened the burden of his brushstrokes. In the 1760s, he executed large works and bold compositions, which made clear his status as one of the most gifted eighteenth century painters of religious subjects. Luz√°n enjoyed much prestige as a teacher and author. Among his disciples were Francisco Bayeu y Sub√≠as, and Francisco Goya. Luz√°n left Madrid to direct the Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Zaragoza, if only briefly, as the institution went through severe financial difficulties and had to close. He managed to see it reopened in 1784, but his health would no longer allow him to teach. He died in his hometown shortly thereafter in 1785.

C. Southall in his 1925 English translation of Helmholtz's Handbuch der physiologischen Optik (Treatise on Physiological Optics). Today, the concept is more widely referred to as unconscious inference, notably by Edwin G. Boring in his widely received 'History of Experimental Psychology', and Daniel T. Gilbert. Cf. Boring 1950, pp. 309-311. is a term of perceptual psychology coined in 1867 by the German physicist and polymath Hermann von Helmholtz to describe an involuntary, pre-rational and reflex-like mechanism which is part of the formation of visual impressions. While precursory notions have been identified in the writings of Thomas Hobbes, Robert Hooke, and Francis NorthCf. Kassler 2004, pp. 125-126. (especially in connection with auditory perception) as well as in Francis Bacon's Novum Organum,\\"[B]y far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness, incompetency, and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it, though they be more important\\" (Bacon 1620, bk. 1, aphorism L, transl.). Helmholtz's theory was long ignored or even dismissed by philosophy and psychology.Cf. Boring 1942, p. 289; Gilbert 1989, p. 191. It has since received new attention from modern research, and the work of recent scholars has approached Helmholtz's view. In the third and final volume of his Handbuch der physiologischen OptikHelmholtz 1867. (1856‚Äì67, translated as Treatise on Physiological Optics in 1920-25), Helmholtz discussed the psychological effects of visual perception. His first example is that of the illusion of the sun rotating around the earth: Optical illusions Two sets of arrows that exhibit the 200px We are unable to do away with such optical illusions by convincing ourselves rationally that our eyes have played tricks on us: obstinately and unswervingly, the mechanism follows its own rule and thus wields an imperious mastery over the human mind. While optical illusions are the most obvious instances of unconscious inference, people's perceptions of each other are similarly influenced by such unintended, unconscious conclusions. Helmholtz's second example refers to theatrical performance, arguing that the strong emotional effect of a play results mainly from the viewers' inability to doubt the visual impressions generated by unconscious inference: The mere sight of another person is sufficient to produce an emotional attitude without any reasonable basis whatsoever, yet highly resilient against all rational criticism. Obviously, the impression is based on the spontaneous, spurious attribution of traits - a process we can hardly avoid, for the human eye, so to speak, is incapable of doubt and thus cannot ward off the impression. The formation of visual impressions, Helmholtz realized, is achieved primarily by unconscious judgments, the results of which \\"can never once be elevated to the plane of conscious judgments\\" and thus \\"lack the purifying and scrutinizing work of conscious thinking\\".Helmholtz 1925, p. 27. In spite of this, the results of unconscious judgments are so impervious to conscious control, so resistant to contradiction that they are \\"impossible to get rid of\\"Helmholtz 1925, p. 28. and \\"the effect of them cannot be overcome\\".Helmholtz 1925, p. 5. So whatever impressions this unconscious inference process leads to, they strike \\"our consciousness as a foreign and overpowering force of nature\\".Helmholtz 1925, p. 28. The reason, Helmholtz suggested, lies in the way visual sensory impressions are processed neurologically.Edgar, Scott (forthcoming). ‚ÄúThe Physiology of the Sense Organs and Early Neo-Kantian Conceptions of Objectivity: Helmholtz, Lange, Liebmann,‚Äù in Flavia Padovani, Alan Richardson & Jonathan Y. Tsou (eds.), Objectivity in Science: Approaches to Historical Epistemology. Boston Studies in Philosophy and History of Science. Springer. The higher cortical centres responsible for conscious deliberation are not involved in the formation of visual impressions. However, as the process is spontaneous and automatic, we are unable to account for just how we arrived at our judgments. Through our eyes, we necessarily perceive things as real, for the results of the unconscious conclusions are interpretations which \\"are urged on our consciousness, so to speak, as if an external power had constrained us, over which our will has no control\\".Helmholtz 1925, p. 26. In recognizing these attitude-formation mechanisms underlying the human processing of nonverbal cues, Helmholtz anticipated developments in science by more than a century. As Daniel Gilbert has pointed out, \\"Helmholtz presaged many current thinkers not only by postulating the existence of such [unconscious inferential] operations, but also by describing their general features\\".Gilbert 1989, p. 189. At the same time, he added, it is \\"probably fair to say that Helmholtz's ideas about the social inference process have exerted no impact whatsoever on social psychology\\".Gilbert 1989, p. 191. Indeed, psychologists have largely felt that Helmholtz had fallen prey to an error in reasoning. As Edwin G. Boring summed up the debate, \\"Since an inference is ostensibly a conscious process and can therefore be neither unconscious nor immediate, [Helmholtz's] view was rejected as self-contradictory\\".Boring 1942, p. 289.Helmholtz himself had justified the use of the term: \\"The psychic activities that lead us to infer that there in front of us at a certain place there is a certain object of a certain character, are generally not conscious activities, but unconscious ones. In their result they are equivalent to a conclusion [...]. But what seems to differentiate them from a conclusion, in the ordinary sense of that word, is that a conclusion is an act of conscious thought. [...] Still it may be permissible to speak of the psychic acts of ordinary perception as unconscious conclusions, thereby making a distinction of some sort between them and the common so-called conscious conclusions. And while it is true that there has been, and probably always will be, a measure of doubt as to the similarity of the psychic activity in the two cases, there can be no doubt as to the similarity between the results of such unconscious conclusions and those of conscious conclusions\\" (Helmholtz 1925, p. 4). However, several recent authors have since approached Helmholtz's conception under a variety of headings, such as \\"snap judgments\\",Schneider, Hastorf, & Ellsworth 1979. \\"nonconscious social information processing\\",Lewicki 1986. \\"spontaneous trait inference\\",Newman & Uleman 1989. \\"people as flexible interpreters\\",Newman, Moskowitz, & Uleman 1996. and \\"unintended thought\\".Uleman & Bargh 1989. Siegfried Frey has pointed out the revolutionary quality of Helmholtz's proposition that it is from the perceiver, not the actor, whence springs the meaning-attribution process performed when we interpret a nonverbal stimulus:  Influences in current computer science and psychology = The Helmholtz machine  Work in computer science has made use of Helmholtz's ideas of unconscious inference by suggesting the cortex contains a generative model of the world. They develop a statistical method for discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns:  Free energy principle  The Free energy principle provides an explanation for embodied perception in neuroscience and tries to explain how biological systems maintain order by restricting themselves to a limited number of states or beliefs about hidden states in their environment. A biological system performs active inference in sampling action outcomes to maximise the evidence for its model of the world:  Notes  References    * Quotations are from the English translation produced by Optical Society of America (1924‚Äì25): Treatise on Physiological Optics.   * Universit√§t Duisburg-Essen: Designing virtual humans for Web 2.0 based learning processes - Unconscious judgments.

History In 1560, Frederick II of Denmark ordered his vassal Otte Brahe to establish lights at Skagen, Anholt and Kullen (in Sweden) to mark the main route through Danish waters from the North Sea to the Baltic. Initially wood and seaweed were used as fuel for the light, burnt on a tiled floor at the top of a wooden tower. Later, coal was used for all Danish lights as it provided better illumination but it often caused the wooden towers to catch fire. It was Jens Pedersen Grove from Helsing√∏r who designed the vippefyr which consisted of a tipping mechanism where the coal could be burnt in an iron container hoisted up into the air so that it could be seen from afar while avoiding damage to the wooden structure. Vippefyr simply means \\"tipping light\\" or \\"rocking light\\".\\"Skagen\\", Fyrt√•rne i Danmark. Retrieved 10 November 2013.

It took a strongly pro-imperialist \\"jingoist\\" stance and was one of the earliest newspapers in southern Africa to feature satirical cartoons. 1879 cartoon from The Lantern attacking the Cape Argus newspaper and its owner Saul Solomon, as being the manipulator behind the principal anti- imperialist leaders of southern Africa. Lantern cartoon by Hugh Fisher (\\"Skit\\") in 1877, on the eve of the Confederation wars. 1880 Lantern cartoon attacking the Afrikaners for ungratefully refusing annexation to the British Empire. The Lantern was owned and edited by an English immigrant Alfred A. Geary, but after he died from a long illness in 1880, it was taken over by Irishman Thomas McCombie. Its exact reach is unknown but it did not approach the mainstream newspapers such as the Times and Cape Argus in its distribution. Its readership was primarily composed of white British immigrant workers, in whose ethnic mobilisation the paper played an important role. Its populist articles took a strong position in favour of British imperial expansion in southern Africa, stronger ties with the British Empire, and a greater sense of ethnic identity for those of British descent. It typically attacked the mainstream press outlets such as Saul Solomon's newspaper the Cape Argus, for being \\"Negrophilist\\". It also strongly opposed any expansion of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise.V.Bickford-Smith: Ethnic Pride and Racial Prejudice in Victorian Cape Town. Cambridge University Press, 2003. The Lantern (like its predecessor The Zingari) featured political cartoons that lampooned the political figures and issues of the day, primarily from a strongly pro-British point of view. The lead cartoonists were William Howard Schr√∂der and Hugh Fisher (\\"Skit\\"). Another artist whose work was occasionally used was Frank Sutton Vane Bennett (1847-16 March 1913), who used the pen name \\"Vane Bennett\\" or \\"VB\\" and who came out to the Cape with theatre manager Disney Roebuck in 1875.

Beset with debts, McCombie moved to the Transvaal in 1889 to restart the paper there. Further inability to meet his financial engagements meant that, after starting a series of papers in Johannesburg, McCombie moved back to Cape Town where he was found drowned at Salt River.

Deploying its own fleet of ice- strengthened vessels, Oceanwide emphasizes small-scale, flexible tours that provide passengers close contact with polar wildlife, landscapes, and historical sites. Tours usually take place in regions only accessible by sea, with little to no infrastructure. The locations visited are first reached by ship, after which expedition guides take small groups of passengers to landing sites by way of Zodiac Milpro RIBs (rigid inflatable boats), enabling safe cruising and maximum shore time.  History  Starting in 1983, the Dutch ‚ÄúPlancius Foundation‚Äù was the first operator to organize yearly polar expedition cruises to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Oceanwide Expeditions continued with the activities of the Plancius Foundation in 1993. The origin of the Plancius Foundation started with the Arctic Centre at the University of Groningen, which launched a research program investigating 17th- century Dutch whaling around Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard chain. With Arctic archaeology professor Louwrens Hacquebord leading the initiative, the ship Pollox was purchased in 1979 and renamed Plancius to accommodate research around the Dutch settlement of Smeerenburg. Along with the scientists on board were tourists who had paid for their Arctic journey, and their contributions formed part of the later financial support for the Svalbard expeditions. Eventually, however, funding troubles overtook the Plancius Foundation and the ship was sold.

Jeon graduated from Kyunghee University with a B.A. and M.A. in Korean literature. He worked, for many years, as a High School teacher and then at a professor of Korean Literature at Kangwon University. Work Jeon Sang-guk drew on his personal experiences in the Korean War and the ensuing division of the country to reconfirm the tragic consequences of these events. For Jeon, however, the real suffering is not in the War itself but in its aftermath, in the families ripped apart and the homes lost; and often, the War provides an opportunity to capture the drama of conflict and confrontation that exists in traditional human relationships. In Ah-be's Family, the wounds left by the war is symbolized in a mentally disabled child of rape, abandoned by his mother, who immigrates to the U.S. with her new family. The guilt-ridden mother, however, fails to find peace in the new land. The tragedy, therefore, is not only found in the rape and its by-product, the handicapped child, but also in the consequence of the attempt to escape the traumatic memories of it. Jeon's serial novel, ‚ÄúThe Road‚Äù (Gil), further investigates the aftermath of the war through the problem of isan gajok or families separated by the war and the division. In the 1980s, Jeon Sang Guk, who worked for a long time as a schoolteacher, expanded the scope of his literary topic to include problems in education. His stories ‚ÄúThe Tears of an Idol‚Äù (Usangui nunmul), ‚ÄúThe Squealing of Piglets‚Äù (Doeji saekkideurui ureum) and ‚ÄúThe Eye of the Darkness‚Äù (Eumjiui nun) take the confined space of the school as a microcosmic setting, and explore the problematic relationships between teachers and students, as well as among the students themselves as they correlate to the similar issues in society at large.Source-attribution\\"Jeon Sang Guk\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Works in Translation * Ahbes Familie (Ï†ÑÏÉÅÍµ≠ Îã®Ìé∏ÏÑ†-ÏïÑÎ≤†Ïùò Í∞ÄÏ°±) * La familia de Abe (Ï†ÑÏÉÅÍµ≠ Îã®Ìé∏ÏÑ†- ÏïÑÎ≤†Ïùò Í∞ÄÏ°±) Works in Korean (Partial) Short Story Collections * The Restless Village (Baram nan maeul, 1977) * That Place Beneath Heaven (Haneul arae geu jari, 1979) * Tears of an Idol (1980) * Ah-be's Family (1980) * Our Wings (Urideurui nalgae, 1981) * The House of Punishment (Hyeongbeorui jip, 1987) * Father (Aebi, 1966).

The Pavilion Apartments are located at 108-136 Martin Luther King Junior Blvd. and the Colonnade Apartments at 25-51 Clifton Avenue in the overlapping neighborhoods known as Seventh Avenue and Lower Broadway. The 22-story towers were designed in the International Style by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and opened in 1960, originally known as Colonnade Park. The towers are built in the modernist style of \\"towers in the park,\\" which advocated dense high-rise housing complexes set within parks and open spaces (which has since fallen out of fashion in favor of mixed-use and low- rise development). Soon after completing Manhattan's Seagram Building, Mies designed the three towers near Branch Brook Park, north of Downtown Newark and adjacent University Heights and Interstate 280. Privately owned, the buildings were intended to bring middle-income families to the area of the Christopher Columbus Homes ‚Äî a cluster of low-income apartment buildings, or projects, which were eventually demolished. The Pavilion Apartments were sold in April 2018. Historical significance The Pavilion and Colonnade Apartments possess exceptional importance in the 20th century social history of Newark, urban planning and development, and Modernist architecture. The district has the distinction of being New Jersey's first urban renewal project and one of the first in the nation. Through an effort of over 10 years, involving planning, court cases, State and Federal legislation, and a number of developers, the Colonnade Park came to fruition in 1960. The immediate surrounding area has New Jersey's highest concentration of historic landmarks, including Plume House (c.1725), State Street Public School (c.1845), House of Prayer (c.1850), Branch Brook Park (c.1895), Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart (c.1898-1954), Newark Broad Street Station (c.1903), and St. Lucy's Church (c.1926), all of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The 20th century's most influential architect, Mies van der Rohe, collaborated with the legendary developer Herbert Greenwald to these towers in Newark among other projects, such as the 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments in Chicago, the Seagram Building in New York City, and Lafayette Park, Detroit. Upon Greenwald's death in a 1959 air crash, Colonnade Park became their last collaboration and Mies‚Äô only residential project in the eastern United States. File:Pavilion Apartments in 1962.jpgThe Pavilion in 1962 File:Colonnade Apartments in 1962.jpgThe Colonnade in 1962 File:Newark Colonnade Floorplan.jpgNewark Colonnade - plan of typical floor Buildings description The Colonnade Park consists of three International Style residential towers designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and completed in 1960. They are located immediately adjacent to the northern edge of Newark's Central Business District, north of Interstate 280, east of Clifton Avenue, south of Seventh Avenue, and west of the intersection of Broad Street and Broadway. Conceived as ‚Äúa city within a city,‚Äù the twin buildings known as the Pavilion Apartments are next to the city's Broad Street thoroughfare, and the large ‚Äúdouble-length‚Äù building known as the Colonnade Apartments faces the majestic Branch Brook Park. The three 22-story aluminum-clad glass high-rises offer 1,240 apartments on a 23.5-acre site. The immediate surrounding area has New Jersey's highest concentration of historic landmarks. It is the only residential work ever constructed in the eastern states that was personally designed by Mies van der Rohe. As such, Mies' Newark project is in many ways aesthetically similar to the Seagram Building, with similar window proportions, exposed beams, columned ground floor, and elevator lobby. Mies‚Äô Colonnade Apartments, with its reflective glass skin, majestically stands above the treetops of Frederick Law Olmsted‚Äôs Branch Brook Park in the west. Downhill toward the east, 1,500 feet away, the two Pavilion Apartments are perpendicularly oriented, but face each other with 500 feet apart. The narrower sides of the two rectangular structures are positioned next to Broad Street, Newark‚Äôs historic artery since 1666. Looking back toward the west, the massive Colonnade Apartments commands a dramatic scene on the top of the elevation, with two Pavilion Apartments symmetrically spaced on its two sides. Now, without the eight Columbus Homes high rises in-between, Maestro Mies‚Äô vision has become ever more pronounced in these three 22-story rental buildings. Upper-level floors command views of Downtown Newark and the Manhattan skyline. A rectilinear prism, the Colonnade Apartments measures 446 feet by 66 feet and contains 560 apartments. (It is Mies‚Äô most expansive structure.) Each bay of the building, that is the distance between two structural columns, measures 22 feet and contains four windows. Each of the two Pavilion Apartments towers is 214 feet by 66 feet with 340 apartments each (680 total). Each tower is a compact mass, symmetrical unto itself, framed by four corners that have a particular aesthetic earlier revealed at Mies' work for the Illinois Institute of Technology. The corners consist of two wide flanges at the center-lines and an eight-inch angle welded between - a feature shared with most of Mies' other towers. These towers were built with reinforced concrete columns to reduce costs, while a skin of glass and prefabricated aluminum moderated the buildings' internal temperature.

It was composed by Hermann Albert Gordon in 1914/1915. It was used during World War I by the German Empire, and a variation of the song with different lyrics was used during World War II by Nazi Germany.  Lyrics  1\\\\.

Wir stehen vor der Infantrie. : Granaten schlagen bei uns ein, Der Franzmann will in unsere Stellung 'rein. : 4\\\\. Er frug nicht warum und nicht wie, Tat seine Pflicht wie alle sie. : In keinem Liede ward's geh√∂rt, Ob er geblieben oder heimgekehrt. : 5\\\\. Bedroht der Feind uns noch so sehr, Wir Deutsche f√ºrchten ihn nicht mehr. : Und ob er auch so stark mag sein, In unsere Stellung kommt er doch nicht 'rein. : 6\\\\. Der Sturm bricht los, die Mine kracht, Der Pionier gleich vorw√§rts macht. : Bis an den Feind macht er sich ran Und z√ºndet dann die Handgranate an. : 7\\\\. Die Infantrie steht auf der Wacht, Bis da√ü die Handgranate kracht, : Geht dann mit Sturm bis an den Feind, Mit Hurra nimmt sie dann die Stellung ein. : 8\\\\. Der Franzmann ruft: Pardon Monsieur! Hebt beide H√§nde in die H√∂h, : Er fleht uns dann um Gnade an, Die wir als Deutsche ihm gew√§hren dann. : 9\\\\.

This version was later arranged by Hanns Eisler and performed by the Erich-Weinert-Ensemble in the German Democratic Republic. 1\\\\.

SA Marschiertlied originated in 1929 from Saxony and was a marching song of the National Socialist Sturmabteilung based on the tune of Argonnerwaldlied. 1\\\\.

Higgins in 1829 near the border of counties Leitrim and Longford, Ireland, he later took the last name of his uncle (Bishop William O'Higgins (1793-1853)), styled O'Higgins, after the royals. After studying in Maynooth at the Royal College of St. Patrick's, he was sent to British Guiana in the West Indies. He arrived in Philadelphia on May 23, 1857 and joined the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. From 1860 to 1861, he was the assistant to Rev. Richard Gilmour at St. Patrick's in Cincinnati. After difficulties in Cincinnati, William wrote the Archbishop, John B. Purcell, requesting a position as chaplain; this \\"remov[ed him from a thorny personnel situation by responding to an obvious wartime need\\". He was commissioned as chaplain of the 10th Ohio Infantry on June 3, 1861, in which he served until June 17, 1864. Following the war, he returned to Cincinnati as a pastor and chaplain, but later left for the Diocese of Little Rock, Arkansas, where he served at the Cathedral of St. Andrew, with a colleague from Ohio, Bishop Edward Fitzgerald. By 1871, he had returned to Ohio, this time to Cleveland, where he taught at St. Mary's Seminary for one term and subsequently served 6 months as pastor of St. Augustine's Church, Cleveland. In 1973 he returned to County Leitrim, Ireland, where he died November 4, 1874. References * Carter, Ruth C., For Honor, Glory & Union: The Mexican & Civil War Letters of Brig. Gen.

Mathews Manor was built about 1626 for Captain Samuel Mathews. The post-medieval Mathews Manor included a projecting porch and center chimney, both characteristic of Virginia's earliest substantial dwellings. Mathews's house burned about 1650 and was replaced with a smaller house nearby, probably by his son, Samuel Mathews, Jr. (1630-1660), governor of Colonial Virginia (1656-1660). The property was referred to as Denbigh Plantation since the 18th century. Denbigh Plantation Site was one of the 17th-century sites excavated by Colonial Williamsburg's renowned archeologist Ivor No√´l Hume during the 1960s. His findings revealed much about early domestic life in the Virginia colony. In addition to the manor house, the site also includes several 17th-century industrial sites and the archeological remains of the 18th-century home of the Digges family. The foundations of both the Digges and Mathews houses have been capped and delineate their outlines. An 18th-century dairy and early 19th- century kitchen associated with the Digges homestead are still standing. The earliest known porcelain in Virginia, as well as other early artifacts, were found here during excavation. Although now surrounded by residential development, these sites are preserved within a neighborhood park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

The directors became prominent in New Zealand film- making in the next two decades, and one of the location assistants, one Sam Neill, went on to an international career.

There is a surprisingly (for the time) gender- balanced and apolitical narrative which underlines the humanity of the competitors as much as it shows the drama of success and failure‚Äù according to Sam Edwards, although ‚Äúwoman‚Äôs events receive scant coverage‚Äù.

The fort formed the James River terminus of the second trans-peninsula defensive line, which included fortifications at Lee's Mill, as well as Dam No.1 and Wynne's Mill in Newport News Park.

The proposal was dubbed \\"Boris island\\" by the media, reflecting the support for the project from the then London Mayor Boris Johnson. The scheme was proposed by Testrad (Thames Estuary Research and Development), initially an agency formed by Johnson but now also involving other partners, and was rejected by the airport commission in January 2014. History Plans for a Thames Estuary Airport go back many years. The idea was revived in 2008 by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to be located towards the Shivering Sands area, north-east of Whitstable. The deputy mayor, Kit Malthouse, had supported a Thames estuary airport since before taking office. In November 2008, the mayor appointed Doug Oakervee (executive chair of Crossrail) to lead the Greater London Authority's preliminary feasibility study, which determined in October 2009 that there is \\"no logical constraint\\" to the plan. The name London Britannia Airport was adopted for the latest iteration of the idea presented in November 2013. This proposal would cost ¬£47.3 billion and would mean the closure of Heathrow Airport. In early 2014 it was revealed that the Airports Commission, in its interim report, did not recommend the London Britannia proposal for further analysis. Analysis of the scheme Proponents argue the scheme's big advantage is that it would avoid flying over densely populated areas and the noise pollution and other problems that causes. Some local councils and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds oppose the plan, as do current London airports. Critics suggest the scheme is impractical and too expensive; Terry Farrell compared it to grandiose and unrealistic projects devised by Adolf Hitler.

His greatest achievements were in developing histochemical techniques for studying the structure and functions of cells and their organelles. He is also recognized as a public figure of the mid-20th century at the height of McCarthyism in America. He was accused of his participation in Communist Party as disloyalty to the nation. He was dismissed in 1953 from the University of Vermont College of Medicine where he was serving as a tenured professor, upon his refusal to cooperate in disclosing his communist friends. He was even denied twice of his willingness to serve in the US Army during the Second World War. Due to lack of substantial evidence, the case itself was dismissed after twenty years. The incident has become popularly known as the \\"Novikoff Affair\\", and is the most notable case of MaCarthyism in Vermont. In 1983, after thirty years of his banishment, the university made an apology by presenting him an honorary degree. He is regarded as one of the overlooked scientists to get Nobel Prize. Early life and education Novikoff was born to Jewish parents in the small town of Semenivka in Ukraine. Hoping to overcome severe poverty under the then Soviet Union, his family emigrated to the United States. The family settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York. His father earned their living by working as a salesman in a garment factory. Novikoff was a precocious boy, developing an early fascination for biology. His hobbies included skinning and dissecting animal corpses, and he once boiled a dead cat to observe its skeleton. He skipped four grades, and completed high school when he was only fourteen years of age. He graduated from Columbia University in 1931 at the age of eighteen. Even under financial constraints, the family encouraged him to study medicine. However antisemitism at the time prevented him from entering medical school. He therefore pursued the only open opportunity by continuing at the same university to study zoology. He joined the graduate school in 1931. Career While still at the graduate school, to support his studies, Novikoff worked as a part-time instructor at the new Brooklyn College. His initial research focused on experimental embryology, and soon his interest shifted to cell biology under the influence of Arthur Pollister. At age twenty-three, in 1936, he published his first technical paper. In 1938 he was awarded his PhD. He was not on good terms with the other teachers and the administration at Brooklyn College, such that his promotion was delayed for a year even after his new degree. He did a post-doc at the University of Wisconsin in 1946-1947\\\\. In 1947 he joined the University of Vermont College of Medicine as Professor of Experimental Pathology and Biochemistry. He was expelled from the institute in 1953 on charges of disloyalty to the nation. In 1955 he joined the faculty of pathology at the newly established Albert Einstein College of Medicine, becoming full professor in 1958. He worked there for the rest of his life. Achievements During his career at Vermont, Novikoff had successfully developed a technique of cell fractionation. Using this he had separated cell fractions and identified six cell organelles, along with two unidentified fractions. Christian de Duve from Belgium became interested in the unknown fractions. In 1952 de Duve proposed that the fraction contained membrane-bound particle having specific enzymatic activity. Novikoff confirmed the enzyme activity in 1953. The two met at Central Park in New York City to discuss their results. In 1955, now confident that the membranous particles were cell organelles, de Duve gave a hypothetical name \\"lysosomes\\" to reflect their digestive properties. That same year, after visiting de Duve's laboratory, using his own histochemical protocol Novikoff successfully produced the first real images (electron micrographs) of the new organelle. In 1965 with de Duve, he confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes. Novikoff further established the importance of lysosomes in diseases. \\"It is largely due to Novikoff's bold and imaginative use of morphological techniques,\\" de Duve praised him, \\"that lysosomes have come to be recognized in a broader biological context.\\" de Duve went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for the discovery of lysosomes, but Novikoff's contributions were forgotten. In 1956 Novikoff described a new class of membrane-bound organelles that he called \\"dense bodies.\\" was the first to describe the actual lysosomal functions with respect to degradation of mitochondria. However he thought that the digestive activities he observed were due to other intracelluar organelles which he called \\"cytolysomes\\". It was at the Ciba Foundation Symposium on Lysosomes held in London on 12-14 February 1963, that he explained this phenomenon in which organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, mitochondria and other cell debris were degraded by autolysis in the cytolysomes. Then the following speaker de Duve correctly identified that these organelles were lysosomes, and named them autophagic vacuoles, and he introduced the term \\"autophagy\\" for the process of such intracellular digestion. In 1962 he established for the first time the functional relationship between ER, Golgi and lysosomes. He specifically showed that smooth-surfaced derivatives of the ER fused with the Golgi membranes and the Golgi membranes in turn fused with lysosomes. He was the first to show that this GERL is responsible vesicular transport during synthesis and sorting of proteins. He gave this functional organisation an acronym GERL, for Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum-lysosome. Novikoff's further works became a milestone in understanding the importance of autophagy in diseases such as cancer. He was the first to establish the type of liver tumour, now known in his honour as \\"Novikoff hepatoma\\". In 1961 with Sidney Goldfischer, Novikoff developed a staining method for the Golgi body using the enzyme nucleosidediphosphatase, by which they described the enzymatic property of the organelle for the first time. In 1969 they developed a staining technique (alkaline diaminobenzidine, or DAB) by which they studied the structure of another new organelle, peroxisome, for the first time. In 1969 he gave the first clear-cut distinction between lysosomes and peroxisomes. In 1972, he and his wife discovered a new type of peroxisomes from the intestinal epithelium of rat, which they named \\"microperoxisome\\". His works in cell biology are best summed up in a textbook he wrote with his student Eric Holtzman, Cells and Organelles, first published in 1970. The Novikoff Affair In 1935, Novikoff joined the Communist Party while he was working for PhD. He was most inspired by the scientific attitude of Marxism towards the well-being of society, beside other idealistic issues. He helped writing and disseminating party newsletters in the Brooklyn campus, which was a centre of communist activity in the area. He became actively involved in the teachers' union and particularly fought against stratification of junior and senior faculty in the college. This caused serious antagonism with other teachers and the administration. In 1940 under a new college president, Novikoff was investigated for affiliation to the Communist Party. However, no further action was taken against him. During the Second World War he voluntarily applied to serve in the US military on a medical commission. His applications were declined twice, in 1943 and in 1944. The objections were based on the allegations in the previous documents that his \\"loyalty\\" to the nation was doubtful. Ironically, he was employed by the US Army after the war, in 1948, to analyse two films about enzyme and carbohydrate metabolism. Even then doubt about his loyalty resurfaced and his appointment was terminated soon after he completed the major work. In 1953 while he was a permanent faculty at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, at the time McCarthyism was at its height, anti-communist activists once again targeted him for his 1930s involvement in the Communist Party. But this time the case was taken to the federal level. On 23 April 1953, he refused to testify before the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security at Washington D.C. on anything about his past political life, especially on identification of his communist colleagues at Brooklyn College. His denial was taken as \\"positive evidence that he was the leader of communist-dominated union.\\" Although he invoked the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, the Vermont administration made sure that the institute dismiss him. The then Vermont Governor Lee E. Emerson persuaded the university President Carl Borgmann to convene a six-person committee consisting of faculty and Board of Trustees, to assure that the \\"faculty is 100 percent pro-American and anti-communist\\". Even though the committee, chaired by Robert Joyce, voted 5 to 1 for Novikoff to remain in his profession, Emerson convinced the Board of Trustees to override the committee's decision. The trustees therefore suspended Novikoff on 16 July initially for a month, with the \\"walk or talk\\" ultimatum that if Novikoff would not return to Washington to reveal names before the Senate Committee, he would be dismissed from the university. Members of the university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors could convince Borgmann in August 1953 that it was against the university bylaws to suspend Novikoff before any public hearing. Then a final hearing was convened that consisted of twenty-three member Board of Review, which included the governor, members of the Board of Trustees, and several faculty members. The board meeting on 29 August voted 14 to 8 to recommend the dismissal of Novikoff. A week later, on 5 September, the fifteen-member Board of Trustees confirmed his firing from the university, with a single dissenting vote from Robert Joyce. His case was kept open for twenty years, and having found no substantiated evidence, the FBI closed his file in 1974, which by then contained 822 pages. Vermont University then conferred him an honorary doctorate of science as a way of apology in 1983, after thirty years of his dismissal, with 8,000 audience giving standing ovation.

On April 5, 1862, advance units of Union Brigadier General Erasmus D. Keyes' IV Corps, under the command of Union Brigadier General William Farrar Smith, encountered Confederate units commanded by Brigadier General Lafayette McLaws at Lee's Mill. Heavy rains and massive earthen fortifications defending the river crossing stopped the Union troops from proceeding to Richmond. Confederate Major General John B. Magruder's extensive defensives beginning at Lee's Mill and extending to Yorktown along the Warwick River caused the Union Army of the Potomac Commander Major General George B. McClellan to initiate a month-long siege of the Warwick-Yorktown Line which lasted until May 3, 1862 and contributed to the eventual failure of McClellan's campaign.

He created and he manages the Ethical Fashion Initiative of the International Trade Centre (ITC), which is a joint agency of the United Nations and the WTO. The Ethical Fashion Initiative harnesses the power of fashion as a vehicle out of poverty by connecting top designers, including Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, to marginalized artisans in East Africa, West Africa and Haiti. In 2013, Cipriani was included in Business of Fashion‚Äôs list of 500 People Shaping the Global Fashion Industry. Career overview Simone Cipriani was born in Pistoia, Tuscany, Italy, and completed his studies in Political Sciences and International Economy at the University of Florence. He began his career at CESECA, a company that offered Italian shoe and leather brands services in quality control, technological innovation and delocalisation of production. He participated in research projects within the EU Research and Development framework, and served on the board of directors of PromoIndia. He also directed an export consortium for Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In the 1990s Cipriani directed PISIE, an organisation that offered training and capacity building to leather industry entrepreneurs in the developing world. He worked on projects in India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh, before moving to Ethiopia, where he managed a large intervention by United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) to improve the national leather industry. Whilst living in Ethiopia he was central to the establishment Taytu, a leather handbag brand that was touted as Africa's first luxury label. The Ethical Fashion Initiative The idea for The Ethical Fashion Initiative was born when Cipriani was introduced to skilled artisans living in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. After a successful one-year trial, the Ethical Fashion Initiative became an ongoing United Nations project. The Ethical Fashion Initiative represents a new way of doing business in the fashion sector, making it possible for communities in slums and impoverished rural areas to be part of the international value chain of fashion.Touched by human hands, The New York Times, September 4, 2012 It empowers women by generating work, allowing them to become micro-entrepreneurs. This is achieved through a business support infrastructure that facilitates fair collaboration with fashion houses and large distributors. The Ethical Fashion Initiative also supports and promotes emerging design talent from Africa. Location of operations The long-term locations of the Ethical Fashion Initiative are in Kenya, Burkina Faso, Mali, Ethiopia and Mali. Proven success in lifting large numbers of people out of poverty long term and giving them the power to change their lives has resulted in the programme expanding to Haiti and the West African nations of Ghana, Mali and Burkina Faso. To date, there are hubs of production in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Accra, Ghana, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In addition, there are smaller hubs of production in Gilgil, Thika, Korogocho, Dagoretti and Waithaka, all in Kenya. Since 2014, EFI is also expanding in Palestine and Cambodia. Economic system Underpinning its success is an economic system designed to work in areas of deprivation. Because of this system of logistics The Ethical Fashion Initiative is able to work over a vast geographical area, both in slums and disadvantaged rural areas. Cipriani is responsible for this system which has been praised by The Economist. Events and fashion shows The Ethical Fashion Initiative, Vivienne Westwood and Yoox collaborated on an event at Pitti Immagine, Florence, which showcased bags designed by Westwood, photographs by Juergen Teller and seven short films about Westwood and Teller‚Äôs first trip to Kenya. In July 2010 The Ethical Fashion Initiative joined forces with Vogue Italia for the ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs on Next?‚Äù competition at Alta Roma with the young designer winners then travelling to Kenya to learn about ethical production. In association with Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs in July 2013 The Ethical Fashion Initiative partnered with AltaRoma on the \\"Africa to Rome\\" showcase, which promoted the work of Ghanaian designers Christie Brown and Kiki Clothing, as well as international designers Stella Jean and Portenier Roth. Partly as a result of this show, Stella Jean was offered a show by Giorgio Armani at Armani Teatro Milan, September 21, 2013. This showcased textiles woven with the initiative in Burkina Faso. In June 2014, Cipriani invited Italian-Haitian designer Stella Jean for a fashion show in Geneva to mark the International Trade Centre‚Äôs 50th Anniversary. This event cemented the growing partnership with Stella Jean, as the designer is expanding her work to more countries where the Initiative works: Burkina Faso but also Mali, Haiti and Kenya. In July 2014 the Ethical Fashion Initiative collaborated again with Altaroma for the Beat of Africa and Room Service showcase. This promoted the work of Stella Jean and three West African designers - Lisa Folawiyo (Nigeria), duaba serwa (Ghana) and Mina Evans (Ghana). Three designers from Ghana participated in the Room Service event: Anita Quansah London, Christie Brown and MO SAIQUE, participated at the Altaroma Room Service. The participation of designers from West Africa is part of the Ethical Fashion Initiative's project, based in Ghana, of mentoring emerging African design talent. Cipriani attended the La Jolla International Fashion Film Festival, where the Ethical Fashion Initiative‚Äôs film ‚ÄúAround the World with Stella Jean‚Äù received the prize for the Best Message category. Nurturing emerging design talent In 2012 Cipriani expanded the scope of the initiative to include a program aimed at helping designers from West Africa to expand their established businesses across the region and also to have the possibility of export to Europe. Christie Brown designer Aisha Obuobi and Kiki Clothing‚Äôs Titi Ademola were the first designers in the scheme. Their collections were shown on that catwalk of Alta Roma in July 2013. In September 2013, both designers were invited to Milan to take part in Vogue‚Äôs Fashion Night Out at leading Milan fashion store group, Biffi. In 2014, the Ethical Fashion Initiative brought new design talent from Africa to IED Moda and AltaRoma (Catwalk show and Room Service). In June 2015 and January 2016, the Ethical Fashion Initiative participated at Pitti Immagine's Pitti Uomo fair in Florence. On both occasions, the Ethical Fashion Initiative supported several African fashion brands to showcase their menswear collection at the event (Dent de Man, MaXhosa by Laduma, Proyecto Mental, Orange Culture, Lukhanyo Mdingi, Nicholas Coutts, AKJP, U.Mi-1 and Ikir√© Jones). Speaking engagements From November 2015 to May 2016, Cipriani led the Hand of Fashion lectures at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York to promote discussion around the theme of sustainable fashion. Guest lecturers have included Omoyemi Akerele, Bob Bland, Marie Claire Daveu, Oskar Metsavaht, Miguel Flux√°, Hirofumi Kurino, Aurora James, Auret van Heerden and Lisa Barratt. In April 2016, Cipriani spoke at the Fashion Business Series organised by Omoyemi Akerele of Style House Files and Lagos Fashion & Design Week. Cipriani has spoken about the concept of luxury at the Manchester Metropolitan University's Hollings faculty \\"The Big Issue\\" conference. In November 2015, Cipriani chaired the \\"Sustainable Fashion: Empowering women in Africa's fashion industry\\" at the United Nations Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva and also at the 2015 International Textile and Apparel Association conference in Santa Fe. In September 2015, Cipriani spoke at the Aspen Institute Alliance for Artisan Enterprise conference calling for the fashion industry's business model to involve artisans in a fairer & more effective way.

Additionally, CLR works with post- secondary youth literacy too.  Projects and activities  Early Childhood Care & Development *Technical Support to Chhattisgarh Government Agencies for Forthcoming Project in Caregiver Education for Home-based Holistic Child Care and Related Community-based Advocacy: Known as Sajag, this program was started in January 2012 in Rajnandgaon Block of Chhattisgarh. The program aims at promoting holistic based Child-care. Financially supported by the UNICEF and EU, it is a unified effort by various government departments like the Dept. of Health, State Literacy Mission Authority (SLMA), Women and Child Welfare Department (WCD), to promote integrated health care for children with the assistance of CLR. It was originally a one-year program but has been extended for another year till March 2014. Early childhood education *Observation-Cum- Lab Centres to Demonstrate Effective Early Childhood Education (ECE): Since 2008, CLR has been developing anganwadi centres in Mulshi Block, Pune as model observation blocks for other Integrated Child Development Services (Integrated Child Development Services) and NGO functionaries involved in ECE. *Building Capacities within NGOs-Corporates-Government for Early Childhood Education: CLR is providing technical inputs to Kalike Samruddhi Upakram (KSU) and Community Development Foundation (CDF) in Yadgir, Karnataka and the CSR initiative of Forbes Marshall, Pune that assist anganwadis in providing school readiness support to early-school-going-age children. *Fulfilling the Young Child's Right to Development by Strengthening the Pre-School (ECE) Component in ICDS Anganwadis: Since 2009, CLR has initiated an action research project in Melghat, Amravati District that enables anganwadis across Dharni block to provide Quality ECE to the pre-dominantly tribal population of the area with the goal to demonstrate a replicable decentralized strategy, through capacity building at all levels of ICDS, for strengthening the ECE component in ICDS projects in Maharashtra and other regions of the country.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. It was the last by-election of the 27th Parliament to take place before the 1906 general election. Vacancy Hon. John Douglas-Scott-Montagu had been Conservative MP for the seat of New Forest since the 1892 general election. His father, Henry John Douglas-Scott-Montagu died on 4 November 1905. He succeeded his father as Baron Montagu of Beaulieu and entered the House of Lords. Electoral history The seat had been Conservative since it was created in 1885. There had not been a contested election in the seat since 1892. The voting figures then were; Candidates *The local Conservative Association selected 33-year-old Henry Francis Compton as their candidate to defend the seat. He was standing for parliament for the first time. He was the son of Henry Compton, of Minstead Manor House, Hampshire. He served as a Magistrate and as an officer in the 4th Volunteer Battalion Hampshire Regiment. His grandfather and uncle had also been Members of Parliament, the latter sitting for the New Forest Constituency between 1885 and 1892.The Times, 8 Dec 1905 *The local Liberal Association selected 69-year-old Robert Hobart as their candidate to gain the seat. He was also standing for parliament for the first time. Hobart was the oldest son of Henry Hobart, third son of the 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire, and Charlotte Selina Moore, daughter of Richard Moore. He was a civil servant in the War Office between 1860 and 1900, and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1885. In October 1901 the Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk, appointed him a Secretary to the Earl Marshal¬¥s office, to work on preparations for the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII. He received the 1902 Coronation medal and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) for his services.Who Was Who Campaign Polling Day was fixed for the 6 December 1905, 32 days after the vacancy became known. The two most prominent issues at the time of the by-election were Irish Home Rule and Tariff Reform. The issue of Home Rule was one that had split the Liberal Party back in 1886 with the Liberal Unionist's joining with the Conservatives to oppose it. The issue of Tariff reform was one that was currently dividing the Conservative Party, who had seen many of their Free Trade supporters leave to join the Liberals. Leading Liberal Unionist, Joseph Chamberlain had managed to persuade Conservative Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour and the party as a whole to support the introduction of trade tariffs on imports. The Liberal Party argued that these measures would increase the cost of food. Divisions within the government on this issue and others widened and on 4 December 1905, two days before polling day, the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour collapsed and he resigned as Prime Minister. Liberal Leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman then formed a government. Result The Conservatives narrowly held onto the seat but the fact that the Liberals had polled far better than they had in 1892 when the Conservatives nationally fell short of an overall majority, was a good indicator that the Liberals could win the next General Election: This is how The Saturday Review viewed the result: \\"The New Forest Division of Hampshire has returned Mr. Compton the Conservative by a small majority; reduced, still a majority. A seat or two does not make a world of difference just now, and we could half wish that the New Forest electors had shown the grace to welcome the new Prime Minister by returning his supporter, Sir Henry Hobart. It would have been a pretty form of congratulation. However we can congratulate Sir Henry Hobart ‚Äî a really earnest Liberal and very anxious to sit for a Hampshire constituency - on his good fortune ; it is not every man to whom is given, as Sir Henry will be, the chance to have a second shot within a month or so.\\"The Saturday Review of Politics, Literature, Science and Art, Volume 100, 1905 Aftermath As Parliament was not sitting at the time, Compton was unable to take his seat. Prime Minister Campbell-Bannerman then dissolved parliament and called a General Election, at which Compton was defeated by Hobart: References Category:1905 in England Category:1905 elections in the United Kingdom Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Hampshire constituencies Category:New Forest District Category:20th century in Hampshire ","title":"1905 New Forest by-election"},{"id":"41048510","text":"Lee Seong-bok (Hangul: Ïù¥ÏÑ±Î≥µ) is a South Korean poet known for his imaginative and multi-layered poetry.\\"Ïù¥ÏÑ±Î≥µ\\" biographical PDF available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Life Lee Seong-bok was born on June 4, 1952 in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea.

Biography G√≥mez was born in Valencia into a family of artists. He was the son of the painter Pedro Salvador, and he would start in the practice of painting with his brother Luciano, who would also become a painter of some renown imitating Flemish painting. In Valencia he starred as an \\"Academic Major\\" in the academy established in the convent of Santo Domingo. He probably perfected his studies in the studio of Jer√≥nimo Jacinto de Espinosa, whose influence is evident in his early works, and perhaps undertook a trip to Italy, a fact which could not be confirmed documentary. He was a painter as early as fourteen years old and painted some pictures of the life of St. Ignatius of Loyola for la Casa Profesa de Valencia. In his voluminous preserved collection, the first works that can be dated with certainty is dedicated to San Vicente Ferrer in the chapel of the convent of Santo Domingo de Valencia ( 1665), paintings close to the work of Espinosa and not inferior. Very different are other works, considered later, in which the artist was interested in deep architectural perspectives, with a very dynamic treatment of the figures and a dramatic study of light, as can be found on the Purification of the Temple which now resides in the Museo del Prado. His intellectual interests are reflected in his library, with works largely from the collection of Alonzo Cano, and his dedication to the front of the Academy of the convent of Santo Domingo, where theoretical and practical lessons taught drawing by artists to members of the nobility and clergy, which left a very vivid description by Jos√© Garc√≠a Hidalgo.

In 1901 he went on a mission to the United States in order to study women‚Äôs rights, especially the right of women to vote (suffrage) A summary of his work appeared in the Journal of Sociology and as an annex to the Neo-Scholastic Review.Mrs. Carry Chapman Catt provides all the details about this mission in a report about a : \\"Hearing before the committee on the judiciary of the house of representatives\\", Washington, Tuesday February 18, 1902, pag. 14 en 15; details are also given in The Salt Lake Herald, Augustus 31, 1901 which erroneously promotes Deschamps to Minister of Education.Les causes sociales du f√©minisme aux Etats-Unis, Annales ...pp. 337-401; Revue N√©o-Scolastique .. pp. 1-69. Through numerous reviews of books and numerous articles in various scientific journals of an intellectual, social and Catholic character, he defended, as a former disciple and follower of D√©sir√© Mercier, the positivist thought of Auguste Comte.Wils, K. (2005).

Later he joined the colonial University of Antwerp as a professor. During the First World War and the closure of universities, he found refuge in England at the University of Cambridge, Christ College. In 1933, his academic career ended and he was awarded the royal decree \\"emeritus\\" presented to him by Camille Huysmans. After the First World War, as a moderate Catholic he defended some of the ideas of Charles Maurras, but abandoned this path when these ideas took a turn he disapproved of.Defoort, E.

Until 1940 he participated actively and extensively in socio-political and religious debates in Catholic journals such as \\"The Twentieth Century\\" and \\"La Libre Belgique\\", usually on the first page. With his best friend Georges Legrand, professor of social economy at the university faculty of Agricultural Sciences of Gembloux, whom he met at the ISP, he shared his ideas as regards evolution and its development.

He built upon the work of his father and expanded the family's industrial holdings in the Aberdare and Rhondda valleys. He had two daughters, Mary and Catherine. Mary married H.T. Edwards, vicar of Aberdare and later Dean of St Asaph and Catherine married Sir Francis Edwards. Career in industry The family business, built up by his father, was based on the Aberdare Valley, and a number of collieries were opened south of Aberdare, such as that at Abercwmboi. During his father's last years, the family became involved in the early exploitation of the coal reserves of the neighbouring Rhondda Valleys, with the Davis family's operations being concentrated on Ferndale in the Rhondda Fach. Despite the huge loss of life at Ferndale in 1867 he was regarded as a good employer. During the strikes of the 1870s, Davis was among the most conciliatory among the coal owners, endeavouring to bring disputes to an end. The collieries of David Davis and Sons remained open throughout the lock-out of 1875. He later became vice-chairman of the South Wales Conciliation Board, chaired by H. H.Vivian. A wealthy man, he had quarrying ventures in Merioneth, and became high sheriff of the county in 1869. He built a house at Arthog, between Dolgellau and Barmouth where his wife died in 1880. Politics and public life Davis was from an early age more interested in public life than his self-made father had been. As early as 1847 he was involved in public meetings called in response to the 1847 Education Reports. He became actively involved in the public life of the Aberdare Valley, as a member of the Aberdare Local Board of Health and Aberdare School Board. His educational interests also made him a generous supporter of the University colleges at Aberystwyth and Cardiff. In the 1860s he was initially mentioned as a prospective Liberal candidate for the Merthyr Boroughs parliamentary seat. However, he declined the invitation and was prominent in Henry Richard's successful campaign for election as MP for the constituency. Davis presided at a number of Richard's meetings. At one such meeting, at Trecynon in late September, Richard criticised those who had sought to discourage him from contesting the seat, both publicly and privately (a veiled reference to Thomas Price of Calfaria). At the end of the meeting the crowd released the horses and drew Richard's carriage back to Davis's residence at Maesyffynon. Like his brother, Lewis, was invited to contest the second seat there when Richard Fothergill retired in 1880. Religion Unlike his father, who remained an active Wesleyan throughout his life, David Davis, Maesyffynnon, became involved in a schism which led to the short-lived 'Wesleyan Reform' movement. The 'Reform' chapel at Aberdare eventually, became Congregationalist. Later life Davis died in 1884 at the residence of his brother, Lewis Davis, Ferndale.

They are relatively large ghost crabs with a somewhat trapezoidal body. The carapace reaches a length of and a width of . They are a mottled brown to yellow in coloration. Like other ghost crabs, one of their claws is much larger than the other. Their eyestalks are large and elongated, tipped with prolongations at the tip known as styles. They are common inhabitants of open sandy beaches, living in burrows in the intertidal zone. Taxonomy Ocypode brevicornis was first described by the French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837. However, his type specimens consisted only of two juvenile individuals from Pondicherry, India. In 1852, he again described the same species from adult specimens recovered from the same area as Ocypode platytarsis. In 1880, the American zoologist John Sterling Kingsley synonymized Ocypode brevicornis with Ocypode ceratophthalma. As a result, only Ocypode platytarsis was regarded as valid for the entirety of the 20th century. And most literature concerning the species refer to it as Ocypode platytarsis. In 2013, the Japanese carcinologist Katsushi Sakai and German carcinologist Michael T√ºrkay discovered that the type specimens of Ocypode brevicornis and Ocypode platytarsis belonged to the same species. They restored the validity of the earlier name Ocypode brevicornis. Ocypode brevicornis has also been frequently confused with Ocypode ceratophthalma, due to the fact that both species possess elongations of their eyestalks (styles). The variety Ocypode brevicornis var. longicornuta described by the American zoologist James Dwight Dana is now known to be a synonym of Ocypode ceratophthalma. Ocypode brevicornis belongs to the genus Ocypode of the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae in the family Ocypodidae. Description Ocypode brevicornis are large ghost crabs with deep bodies. The carapace in adults ranges from in length, and in width. It is almost trapezoidal in shape, with the rear end distinctly narrower than the front. It is wider than it is long and covered with scattered rough bumps (tubercles). The upper margins of the eye sockets slant forwards on the inner half and backwards for the outer half. The edges of the eye sockets are rectangular. Ocypode brevicornis in Chennai, India The eyestalks are large and swollen with the cornea occupying most of the bottom half. The eyestalks exhibit prolongations (styles) on the tips like some other members of the genus. The styles may be absent or much shorter in juvenile specimens, as it only starts growing when the crab is around in length. Stridulating ridge on the palm of the larger claw of Ocypode brevicornis Like other ghost crabs, one of the claw appendages (chelipeds, the first pereiopod pair) of Ocypode brevicornis is much bigger than the other. The palm of the larger cheliped is long with a rough bumpy texture on the upper surface. The upper edges of the palm are covered with small bumps while the bottom edge is serrated. The inner surface of the palm of the larger claw in both sexes features stridulating (sound-producing) ridges, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In Ocypode brevicornis, the stridulating ridge is composed of a row of 23 to 28 tubercles. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end. The first gonopod (appendages modified into sexual organs) of the male is stem-like. Its cross-section has three sides on the base ending in a slightly curving tip. A broad and flat palp is present. The covering (operculum) of the female genital opening is oriented lengthwise with a thick straight rim slanting backwards. Adult Ocypode brevicornis are a mottled yellow to brown in coloration. Males have been observed to display brighter yellow colors, especially on their legs. Juveniles have almost perfect cryptic camouflage, making it very difficult to pick them out from their surroundings. Ecology Like other ghost crabs, Ocypode brevicornis live in deep burrows near the intertidal zone of open sandy beaches. They are generalists, scavenging carrion and debris as well as preying on small animals. They are primarily nocturnal, though they may emerge during the day. They are swift runners, darting away to their burrows at the slightest sign of danger, even when the intruder sighted is still away. However, they can be approached much more closely at night, though they may still try to escape if illuminated. Males of Ocypode brevicornis exhibit elaborate territorial displays. Like other ghost crabs, they produce sound and vibration by rapping their larger claws against the ground. They may also display \\"dances\\" on the approach of another ghost crab. Beginning with a rearing posture, the males conduct increasingly complex sideways movements ending by running around the intruder in circles until it retreats. Distribution Ocypode brevicornis are restricted to the Indian Ocean. They can be found from the Gulf of Oman to India, Sri Lanka, and the Nicobar Islands. They are one of six ghost crab species found in the Indian subcontinent, the others being Ocypode ceratophthalma, Ocypode cordimanus, Ocypode macrocera, Ocypode pallidula, and Ocypode rotundata.

The type strain of T. elfii is SEBR 6459T. The genus Thermotoga was originally thought to be strictly found surrounding submarine hydrothermal vents, but this organism was subsequently isolated in African oil wells in 1995. A protective outer sheath allows this microbe to be thermophilic. This organism cannot function in the presence of oxygen making it strictly anaerobic. Some research proposes that the thiosulfate-reducing qualities in this organism could lead to decreased bio-corrosion in oil equipment in industrial settings.  History = Discovery  The genus Thermotoga, previously thought only to be found around submarine hydrothermal vents, was discovered in North Sea oil wells. Due to this discovery, other wells in the area began being investigated, leading to the discovery of Thermotoga elfii in African oil wells in April 1995. T. elfii was gathered in a one-liter sample at the head of a well at 68 ¬∞C. Ravot et al. isolated this species by cultivation on a basal medium containing numerous different nutrients and resources (water, salt, glucose, sodium acetate, etc.) in the lab and then by using repeated trials of the agar shake dilution technique. These scientists concluded by determining the samples' purity through microscopy.  Taxonomy  The first name of Thermotoga elfii is derived from the Greek root \\"therm,\\" which means heat. \\"Toga,\\" which is a Roman term for an outer garment, is where the second part of the genus name originated. This is due to the outer sheath that wraps around the bacteria to protect it from the extreme temperature often associated with this thermophile. The latter name is derived from Elf- Aquitaine, the French oil company that owned the oil wells where T. elfii was first discovered.  Physiology and Metabolism  Therotoga elfii colonies of 1 millimeter have been observed in a laboratory setting, but the actual structure of the rod-shaped T. elfii is between 0.5-3 micrometers long. Its protective outer sheath is the defining characteristic, which aided in providing T. elfii its name. This structure balloons over each side of the organism and protects it from extreme heat. When a Gram stain is performed on this organism, a gram-negative result is expected. T. elfii has flagella uniformly distributed around its body, making it a peritrichous bacteria. It is also an obligate anaerobe, meaning it cannot tolerate oxygen. Electron acceptors include thiosulfate, arabinose, bio-trypticase, fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, ribose, sucrose, and xylose. Electron donors include acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.  Genome and Phylogeny  The 16s RNA gene is 1,519 bases long with a GC content of 39.6 mol%. Due to T. elfii‚Äôs relatively new status, much information about the number of genes is still unknown. However, a 91.9% relative of this species, Thermotoga maritima, has been documented as having 1.86 million base pairs with 1,877 predicted coding regions. The phylogenic family for Thermotoga elfii contains organisms such as Thermotoga thermarum, Thermotoga maritima, and Thermosipho africanus, which have a roughly 90% relation to this organism.  Ecology  The genus Thermotoga contains some of the most thermophilic microorganisms known. It is composed of species that are thermophilic and hyperthermophilic which can thrive in temperatures as high as 80 ¬∞C. The optimum growth temperature for Thermotoga elfii, however, is 66 ¬∞C. The optimum pH is 7.5 and the optimum salinity is 1.2%.  Applications = Industrial Applications  The discovery of T. elfii has been deemed significant as it has led to other discoveries of methanogens, thermophiles, and sulfate-reducing bacteria. This organism and the others discovered in this unique environment can help make progress in microbe-assisted oil recovery processes. Thiosulfate, often implicated in the corrosion of metals used in oil pipelines, is reduced to sulfide by Thermotoga elfii, which leads many scientists to believe it has a major role in preserving oil extraction equipment.  Environmental Applications  In many anoxic thermal marine hot springs, thiosulfate oxidation often does not occur or occurs at an extremely slow rate. These thermophilic thiosulfate-reducers can play a key role in the mineralization of organic compounds to simpler, plant-accessible forms.

Taxonomy = Taxonomical Meaning  The taxonomic information for Thermotoga naphthophila is the following: Domain, Bacteria; Phylum, Thermotogae ; Order, Thermotogales ; Family, Thermotogaceae ; Genus, Thermotoga; Species, T. naphthophila . Thermotoga naphthophila is an anaerobic, sulfur-compound fixing, hyperthermophile. The species name is originally Greek. The term \\"naphtha\\" means a light petroleum substance that dilutes minerals to bitumen and \\"-philos\\" means love. This translation of the species name combines to form \\"bitumen-loving\\".  Phylogeny  Thermotoga naphthophila can be found under strain types RKU-10, DSM-13996, and JCM-10882T. T. naphthophila cell size ranges within 2-7 micrometers (\\\\mum) long by 0.7- 1.0 \\\\mum wide. Based on 16S rDNA sequences,Thermotoga petrophila, strain RKU-1, is the closest relative to T.naphthophila. Other close relatives of T. naphthophila include Thermotoga maritima and Thermotoga neapolitan according to 16S rDNA analysis. T. maritima has an average 5\\\\mum length. Strains isolated from oil reservoirs, but not considered apart of the T. naphthophila clade include the following species: T. subterranean, T. hypogea, and T. elfii.  Discovery of Organism  T. naphthophila was originally discovered by Takahata et.al. in the subterranean Kubiki oil reservoir of Niigata, Japan. This organism was found with another bacterium called Thermotoga petrophila, RKU-1. In order to transport the species samples, they were placed into sterile glass bottles in cooler boxes with ice. After arriving to the lab, the species were isolated on a medium of 0.2% yeast extract (YE) in artificial seawater at a pH of 7. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to the sample at room temperature after taking out the yeast extract. Containers of liquid medium were placed into 30 milliliter (mL) tubes and subsequentially exposed to H2 reduced copper furnace heat with oxygen free nitrogen. Then, sodium sulfide brought the pH of the medium to a range of 6.9-7.1 and the species were purified with Gelrite plating, an agar substitute. Thermotoga naphthophila naturally has a growth pH range of 5.4-9.0, but optimally prefers a pH of 7.0.  Exposure Methods  T. naphthophila tolerance ranges for pH and sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations were found using inoculated YE-mediums incubated at 80¬∞C to view the species growth. Takahata et.al. exposed the bacteria to various buffers in order to get a better understanding of pH effects. Various gas phases were used to expose the species growth in 10 mL mediums. Additionally, the growth of the species was exposed to 1% cellulose, kerosene, light oil, chitin, crude oil and A-heavy oil in duplicates of 30 mL mediums. Takahata et.al. utilized a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and guanine and cytosine (GC) concentrations to collect metabolic product data from the species. Electron acceptors such as sulfate, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur were investigated on YE-based mediums. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to amplify the DNA base sequence and collect the gyrase B (gyrB) subunit gene from true micro-organisms identified above.  Preliminary Characteristics = Optimum Growth  T. naphthophila and T. petrophila can grow at temperatures ranging between 47-88¬∞C on yeast extract, peptone, glucose, fructose, ribose, arabinose, sucrose, lactose maltose and starch as sole carbon sources. While in the presence of thiosulfate, T. petrophila is inhibited and T. naphthophila continues growing. Elemental sulfur can be reduced to hydrogen sulfide through both T. petrophila and T. naphthophila. According to the Takahata et. al. (2000), these two species are more phylogenetically related than any other Thermotoga species due to sugar use, elemental sulfur effects, and thiosulfate.  Genomics  Thermotoga naphthophila is a rod-shaped species. It has 2-7\\\\mum in length by 0.8-1.2 \\\\mum in width and multiple flagella. It also possesses a unique morphology trait exclusive to the Thermotoga genus, an outer sheath-like structure dubbed a ‚Äútoga‚Äù. T. naphthophila is a hyperthermophile with an optimal temperature of 80¬∞C (176¬∞F), but can survive in 48-86¬∞C (118.4-186.8¬∞F). According to a 16S rDNA sequence analysis, its 1,809,823 GC content was 46.1 mol% which increases thermostability of the DNA.  Metabolism  T. naphthophila requires yeast extract, peptone, glucose, galactose, fructose, mannitol, ribose, arabinose, sucrose, lactose, maltose or starch as the sole carbon and energy source for nutrient requirements. Thermotoga naphthophila was unable to survive on proteins, amino acids, organic acids, alcohols, chitin, or hydrocarbons as a sole carbon and energy source. According to the Takahata et.al., lactate, acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas are its end products from glucose fermentation. Thermotoga naphthophila is unique, when compared to T. petrophila, in that it reduces elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide, but in the presence of elemental sulfur, its growth rate and cellular yield decrease. T. naphthophila also reduces thiosulfate to hydrogen sulfide at a lower rate. According to the previously mentioned article, the microbe‚Äôs growth rate and cellular yield is not affected in the presence of thiosulfate.  Pathogenicity  No known studies have identified Thermotoga naphthophila as pathogenic. Takahata et. al. observed the organism‚Äôs sensitivity to various antibiotics on agar plates for 7 days at 70 ¬∞C. T. naphthophila is sensitive to 100 ¬µg rifampicin, streptomycin, vancomycin or chloramphenicol per milliliter. Thermotoga naphthophila is a unique species of the Thermotoga genus in that it is one of the two known Thermotogales to have an operon in its genome that encodes for a phosphotransferase system sugar transporter (PTS). The PTS is a multicomponent system discovered by Saul Roseman in 1964. The PTS involves enzymes of the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. It is used by bacteria for active transport to intake sugar using phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as the source of energy. The only other known Thermotoga with a PTS sugar transporter is Thermotoga sp. RQ2.  Significance  Thermotoga naphthophila RKU-10 and Thermotoga petrophila RKU-1 since both were discovered in the same area, they can provide the first information on gene distribution that occurs through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in hydrothermal ecosystems. Microbes in the order Thermotogales are used for chemical and food industrial processes due to their extreme thermophilic activity. Thermotoga naphthophila RKU-10 was used to clone the Œ≤-galactosidase gene which is classified as a member of the GH-42 family,. Wallace et. al. (2015), used the Œ≤-galactosidase gene to alleviate gastrointestinal cancer drug toxicity by observing structures and inhibition of the Œ≤-Glucuronidases micro-biome which is associated with the gene in Thermotoga naphthophila.

The only member of the original groups not participating in the new lineup was former Busted guitarist and vocalist Charlie Simpson, who instead opted to focus on his solo career and his band Fightstar. Having previously appeared as special guests during McFly's tenth- anniversary concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, it was announced on 11 November 2013 that former Busted members Bourne and Willis would join McFly to form the six-piece supergroup \\"McBusted\\" and go on an arena tour in April and May 2014. The original eleven-concert McBusted Tour quickly sold out and was eventually extended to 34 shows, including headlining Hyde Park on 6 July 2014. On 16 June 2014, McBusted made their overseas debut, supporting One Direction on their Where We Are Tour in Denmark. They then continued to support One Direction the following night, and again in France on 21 June. They went on to also support One Direction in 2015 on the Australian and European leg of their On the Road Again Tour as special guests. In April 2014, it was revealed that McBusted would be releasing an album. On 7 October, they announced their debut single \\"Air Guitar\\", which debuted at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. It was also announced that they had signed a record deal with Island Records. The band's self-titled debut album was released on 1 December and peaked at number nine. On 10 November 2015, it was announced that Simpson had decided to rejoin Busted after 10 years away from the band, as a consequence Willis confirmed that McBusted had parted ways for the time being, but they \\"enjoyed every minute\\" of their time in the band. Fletcher had previously commented that although McBusted are no longer together, he will not rule out a reunion, stating it \\"definitely doesn't feel like the end\\". History=2013: Background, formation and tour announcement From 19 to 22 September 2013, McFly commemorated their tenth anniversary by performing four concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. During these shows Matt Willis and James Bourne made a surprise brief reunion as Busted when they joined as special guests. (Willis and Bourne's ex-bandmate Charlie Simpson, whose decision to quit Busted led to the band's break-up in January 2005, chose not to take part.) Under the name \\"McBusted\\", the six-piece performed Busted's \\"Year 3000\\" and \\"Air Hostess\\" and McFly's \\"Shine a Light\\". This sparked rumours that Busted could make a comeback. On 11 November 2013, it was announced that Willis and Bourne would join Tom Fletcher, Danny Jones, Dougie Poynter and Harry Judd and go on an eleven-date arena tour as McBusted in 2014, and play both Busted and McFly songs. Simpson refused to be a part of McBusted as he wanted to focus on his own career, but he was paid a \\"six-figure sum\\" by Willis and Bourne after he sold his third of the copyrighted Busted name. A source told the Daily Mirror that Simpson's decision not to be part of McBusted was an amicable one: \\"Charlie wishes the boys lots of luck but he wanted absolutely no involvement. All three sat down amicably and worked out a figure that everyone was happy with. Charlie made it clear in no uncertain terms that that's it for him and the boys now, it's finished.\\" Pre-sale tickets for the eleven shows went on sale at 9am on 14 November and sold out in minutes. Tickets went on general sale the following morning and quickly sold out as well, resulting in the addition of six more concerts in Glasgow, Bournemouth, London, Birmingham, Cardiff and Manchester. Another four dates were then added on 17 November, bringing the tour to 20 dates. Since then, the tour has increased to a total 34 dates throughout April‚ÄìJune 2014. It comprises dates in Glasgow, Liverpool, Bournemouth, London, Newcastle, Nottingham, Leeds, Birmingham, Sheffield, Cardiff, Manchester, Brighton, Dublin and Belfast. Regarding the tour, Judd said, \\"It's bigger than what Busted ever were and it's bigger than what McFly ever were\\". On 9 December, McBusted announced that they would be headlining British Summer Time Hyde Park Festival on 6 July 2014 with the Backstreet Boys, The Vamps, Scouting for Girls and dance troupe Diversity as special guests. On 15 November, McBusted made their first official TV performance, appearing on Children in Need 2013 and playing a medley of four songs: \\"All About You\\", \\"Year 3000\\", \\"Air Hostess\\" and \\"Shine a Light\\". A McBusted version of McFly's song \\"Love Is on the Radio\\" was released on 24 November. 2014: McBusted Tour and McBusted Throughout April‚ÄìJune 2014, McBusted went on their 34-date sold-out nationwide tour. Regarding the McBusted Tour, Judd said, \\"It's bigger than what Busted ever were and it's bigger than what McFly ever were\\". On 6 July 2014, McBusted announced that they would be headlining British Summer Time Hyde Park, with the Backstreet Boys, Five, Scouting for Girls and dance troupe Diversity as special guests. On 16 June, McBusted made their overseas debut, supporting One Direction on their Where We Are Tour in Denmark, following the cancellation of 5 Seconds of Summer. McBusted then continued as the support act the following night, and again in France on 21 June. On 10 September, it was announced that a McBusted concert film, Tourplay, would be released exclusively through Vue Cinemas on 28 October for one day. During an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show on 22 February 2014, Willis said: \\"We always said that we weren't going to say we were going to bring out music, because we didn't want to say that we were going to make music and it be terrible. But we went away, we did some writing and it wasn't terrible.\\" On 1 April, Judd revealed that McBusted would be making an album. On 8 October, the official lyric video to their debut single \\"Air Guitar\\", was released; the song was made available to pre-order on iTunes the same day. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart. On 23 October, the band announced that their debut album McBusted would be released on 1 December. The album debuted and peaked at number 9 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Gold for sales of over 100,000. 2015: McBusted's Most Excellent Adventure Tour, international gigs On 4 November 2014, the band posted on their Twitter and Facebook pages: \\"It's possibly the worst kept secret in entertainment, but we are so stoked to announce the #McBusted2015Tour!!!\\" On 26 January 2015, on their website, they announced that the tour would be called McBusted's Most Excellent Adventure Tour. The tour lasted from 12 March to 22 April 2015, consisting of 21 shows. McBusted were also the support act for the Australian and European legs of One Direction's On the Road Again Tour in 2015. During the Australian dates, McBusted announced and performed two of their own gigs, one in SydneyMcBusted Sydney Setlist ‚Äì The Metro Theatre ‚Äì 21 Feb 2015 and one in Melbourne.McBusted Melbourne Setlist ‚Äì The Palais Theatre ‚Äì 24 Feb 2015 A music video was shot for their song \\"Get Over It\\" in 2014 with the intention of releasing it as a single the next year. However James Bourne confirmed on Twitter that the release was scrapped. A DVD and Blu-ray release of the 2015 tour, McBusted's Most Excellent Adventure Tour ‚Äì Live at the O2, was released on 22 June 2015 and reached number one in the music video charts. Charlie Simpson's return to Busted and McBusted's future The band have nothing more planned, with the members saying they will sit down and discuss what is next. However, Fletcher has suggested that McBusted would end 2016 to allow for McFly to continue. He told Fabulous magazine that \\"McBusted was an opportunity to have fun without knowing where it would take us, but McFly is for life. McBusted has been amazing fun, but it's not where our passion is. McFly is more than a band, we live and breathe it. We want to make album number six.\\"Fabulous magazine, 21 June 2015 On 10 November 2015, Charlie Simpson returned to the original Busted line up with Willis and Bourne.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is by far the best known Helicobacter species primarily because humans infected with it may develop gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers of the non-lymphoma type, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori is also associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. Humans infected with H. salomonis may develop some of the same gastrointestinal diseases viz., stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extrnodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. Other non-H. pylori Helicobacter species that are known to be associated with these gastrointestinal diseases are Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter suis, Helicobacter felis, and Helicobacter heilmannii s.s Because of their disease associations, these four Helicobacter species plus H. salomonis are often group together and termed Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato. H. salomonis bacteria are detected in the stomachs of their natural hosts viz., cats, dogs, and rabbits. Reports suggest that individuals, including children, are infected with this bacterium by having close contact one of these animals: H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases, including those associated with H. salomonis, appear to be zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. It is important to diagnose H. salomonis as well as other Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato infections in patients with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, including in particular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated and cured using antibiotic-based drug regimens (e.g.amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor) directed against the instigating bacterium.

She was a Liberal Party member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1993 to 2001, representing the electorate of Swan Hills. She was Minister for Family and Children's Services, Minister for Seniors and Minister for Women's Interests in the Court government from December 1999 to February 2001. Early life Van de Klashorst was born in England, and arrived in Australia with her family in June 1951. She attended Princess May High School and Fremantle Technical School, and worked in secretarial and management roles before becoming a teacher. Career Van de Klashorst joined the Liberal Party in 1985, and was a founding member of the Gidgegannup branch. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1993 state election, winning the Swan Hills electorate from Labor after the retirement of Gavan Troy. She served on the House Committee (1993‚Äì1994), Joint Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation (1994‚Äì1996) and Library Committee (1997‚Äì1998). She also served on the Select Committee on Intervention in Childbirth (1994‚Äì1995), Select Committee on Heavy Transport (1994‚Äì1996) and the Select Committee on Crime Prevention (1997‚Äì1999). The pro-choice van de Klashorst played a significant role in the push to reform Western Australia's abortion laws in 1998 after two doctors were charged with criminal offences. She initially came out in support of Labor MLC Cheryl Davenport's bill to repeal the section of the Criminal Code that made abortion illegal, and planned to introduce the Davenport bill in the Legislative Assembly as a bipartisan effort. The Liberal-National coalition rejected van de Klashorst's position, instead deciding to move its own rival reform bill, to which van de Klashorst was reported to be \\"close to tears\\". In the subsequent debate, van de Klashorst successfully advocated an additional requirement that women be offered counselling when seeking an abortion. The reform push was ultimately successful, with a compromise passing both houses after the Legislative Council initially backed the Davenport bill and the Legislative Assembly the government bill. Van de Klashorst was Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister for Justice from January 1997 to December 1999, when she was promoted into the ministry after the resignation of Rhonda Parker. She served as Minister for Family and Children's Services, Minister for Seniors and Minister for Women's Interests from 1999 until the 2001 state election, when she was unexpectedly defeated by 24-year-old Labor candidate Jaye Radisich.
