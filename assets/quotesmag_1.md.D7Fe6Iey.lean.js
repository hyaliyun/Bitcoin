It is a colourless, toxic gas that fumes in air. Preparation Phosphorus pentafluoride was first prepared in 1876 by the fluorination of phosphorus pentachloride using arsenic trifluoride, which remains a favored method: :3 PCl5 \\\\+ 5 AsF3 → 3 PF5 \\\\+ 5 AsCl3 Structure Single-crystal X-ray studies indicate that the PF5 has trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Thus it has two distinct types of P−F bonds (axial and equatorial): the length of an axial P−F bond is distinct from the equatorial P−F bond in the solid phase, but not the liquid or gas phases due to Pseudo Berry Rotation. Fluorine-19 NMR spectroscopy, even at temperatures as low as −100 °C, fails to distinguish the axial from the equatorial fluorine environments. The apparent equivalency arises from the low barrier for pseudorotation via the Berry mechanism, by which the axial and equatorial fluorine atoms rapidly exchange positions. The apparent equivalency of the F centers in PF5 was first noted by Gutowsky. The explanation was first described by R. Stephen Berry, after whom the Berry mechanism is named. Berry pseudorotation influences the 19F NMR spectrum of PF5 since NMR spectroscopy operates on a millisecond timescale. Electron diffraction and X-ray crystallography do not detect this effect as the solid state structures are, relative to a molecule in solution, static and can not undergo the necessary changes in atomic position. Lewis acidity Phosphorus pentafluoride is a Lewis acid. This property is relevant to its ready hydrolysis. A well studied adduct is PF5 with pyridine. With primary and secondary amines, the adducts convert readily to dimeric amido-bridged derivatives with the formula [PF4(NR2)]2. A variety of complexes are known with bidentate ligands. Hexafluorophosphoric acid (HPF6) is derived from phosphorus pentafluoride and hydrogen fluoride. Its conjugate base, hexafluorophosphate (PF6–), is a useful non-coordinating anion.

Coloring and symmetry Each face of this polyhedron shares an edge with each other face. As a result, it requires seven colours to colour all adjacent faces, providing the lower bound for the seven colour theorem. It has an axis of 180-degree symmetry; three pairs of faces are congruent leaving one unpaired hexagon that has the same rotational symmetry as the polyhedron. The 14 vertices and 21 edges of the Szilassi polyhedron form an embedding of the Heawood graph onto the surface of a torus. Complete face adjacency GIF animation The tetrahedron and the Szilassi polyhedron are the only two known polyhedra in which each face shares an edge with each other face. If a polyhedron with f faces is embedded onto a surface with h holes, in such a way that each face shares an edge with each other face, it follows by some manipulation of the Euler characteristic that :h = \\\\frac{(f - 4)(f - 3)}{12}. This equation is satisfied for the tetrahedron with h = 0 and f = 4, and for the Szilassi polyhedron with h = 1 and f = 7. The next possible solution, h = 6 and f = 12, would correspond to a polyhedron with 44 vertices and 66 edges. However, it is not known whether such a polyhedron can be realized geometrically (rather than as an abstract polytope). More generally this equation can be satisfied precisely when f is congruent to 0, 3, 4, or 7 modulo 12.

Emission power could be increased from 20 kW to 200 kW and the reception was possible in Moscow or Leningrad due to direct wave propagation. There were three studios, the biggest for symphony orchestras, choirs and opera band, the middle for chamber music and soloists, and the third allocated to lecturers and announcer, equipped with the most modern equipment. Radio Bessarabia had six services: the Secretariat, Technical Service, Service Programs, Administrative Service, Litigation department, and Commercial department.Radiofonie românească: Radio Basarabia With the Soviet occupation in June 1940 most of the backup material, personnel and the archive were withdrawn at Huși, but not the transmitter.

Her subsequent fight for justice ultimately resulted in changes to that state's rape laws and is the subject of a 2003 HBO documentary entitled Rape in a Small Town: The Florence Holway Story, which chronicled her ordeal. Activism Following the assault, Holway incorrectly believed that her attacker, John LaForest, would automatically receive a lengthy sentence, but was shocked to learn that, without her consent, he was instead offered a plea bargain which would result in his receiving a 12-year sentence. The enraged Holway, who firmly maintained that rape is not about sex, but rather violence, started a petition drive and alerted the media to her plight. Due to her efforts, stronger sentences against sex offenders went into effect in 1993: First-time offenders in New Hampshire are now sentenced to 15–20 years instead of 7.5–15 years, second-time offenders are sentenced to 20–40 years, and third-time offenders are sentenced to life without parole. In addition, New Hampshire now has a sex offender registry; prosecutors cannot offer plea bargains without the victim's knowledge. Parole hearing In 2003, Holway testified at LaForest's parole hearing, speaking to him directly and, as shown in the documentary, questioning the sincerity of his remorse. Although his parole was initially denied, he was eventually set free. He was arrested again after just two months for harassing a woman at his workplace. Personal life Holway was married at 28 and had five children, four boys and one girl. An accomplished artist, she enjoyed oil and watercolor painting. Much of her art was inspired by her children and their daily activities.

Apart from the subfamily Coregoninae, the family Salmonidae includes the salmon, trout, and char species of the subfamily Salmoninae, and grayling species of the subfamily Thymallinae. Freshwater whitefish are distributed mainly in relatively cool waters throughout the northern parts of the Northern Hemisphere. The Coregoninae subfamily consists of three nominal genera: *Coregonus Linnaeus, 1758 – whitefishes and ciscoes, which according to some authors number more than 60 species. There are differing opinions on the classification of some species within the genus and the overall number of species. Some species in Arctic regions of Asia and North America forage in marine waters. *Prosopium Jordan, 1878 – round whitefishes, which includes six species, three of which occur only in a single lake. *Stenodus Richardson, 1836 – inconnus, which includes two species, sometimes considered a single species with two subspecies. Phylogenetically, Stenodus is not distinct from Coregonus. Whitefish as food Lox, smoked whitefish, cream cheese, and bagels Smoked freshwater whitefish is sold in delicatessens and eaten as part of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, either filleted or made into whitefish salad.  Evolution due to human interaction  There are a multitude of different species of freshwater whitefish, some are more valued economically than others. Fishing for markets are not uncommon and species such as coregonus lervatus widegreni and coregonus lervatus lervatus. At the time, there was an increase in younger groups of c. lervatus widegreni because when fishing, humans only wanted the larger fish which ended up being the oldest.

Beazley completed his feat pitching two complete-game wins in the team's World Series victory over the New York Yankees in five games, allowing three runs in Game Two and two runs in Game Five for a combined 2.50 ERA. After the season, Beazley enlisted in the U.S. Air Force during World War II.

History  Grayson College was chartered in 1887. Originally housed in a wooden two-story structure in downtown Whitewright, the college soon relocated to a new addition on the north side of town. By 1904, enrollment had reached its highest level. That same year, a fire in the college's chemistry lab destroyed the lab, the library and the main building. In 1905, the college had rebuilt, but students and faculty had dispersed to other areas and enrollment from 1905 to the college's closure in 1912 never again reached the 1904 peak. In 1914, James M. Carlisle from Arlington, Texas, opened the Carlisle Military Academy in the Grayson College building. It closed in 1917, and in 1918, Whitewright purchased the campus and moved the high school to the location. The school district discontinued use of the main building in 1975, though other buildings and new additions were still in use. In 1976, the main college building was demolished.

She was born and raised in Goldsboro, in the tobacco country in eastern North Carolina. She is the author of three collections of short fiction and two novels. Her short stories have been classified as \\"Southern Gnostic\\", and as exemplifying the spirit of the New South. Her work has been compared to Flannery O'Connor's for its spiritual overtones and to Sherwood Anderson's for its depiction of small town life and characters. She taught fiction writing at Louisiana State University, where she served for a number of years as Director of the MFA Program in Creative Writing and is now Professor Emerita. She also worked as fiction editor for the University Press of Mississippi. Her works have been chosen for the \\"Year's Best\\" by the award anthology New Stories From The South five times. In 2009, she was awarded the Robert Penn Warren Award in Fiction from the Fellowship of Southern Writers in recognition of her body of work. In the citation, Allan Gurganus wrote, \\"Moira Crone is a fable maker with a musical ear, a plenitude of nerve, and epic heart.\\" Moira Crone lives in New Orleans. She is married to poet and author Rodger Kamenetz and has two daughters, author Anya Kamenetz and Kezia Kamenetz. Literary career Moira Crone's first book The Winnebago Mysteries was published in 1982 by the Fiction Collective and praised by John Barth as \\"a pure delight.\\" The story \\"Kudzu\\" with its tobacco country setting and frustrated father presaged her later work in What Gets Into Us. The debut novel that followed. A Period of Confinement (Putnam, 1985) was listed as new and noteworthy by the New York Times, which commented, 'This is a first novel that makes you sit up and pay attention.\\" The novel set in Baltimore in the late 70's tells of \\"the confinement of Alma Taylor, a young artist, begins when she falls in love; then she gets pregnant, marries and finally flees to New York.\\" Publisher's Weekly found \\"much to savor in this small, deeply affecting novel, written in the voice of a woman who abandons her baby and husband in a depressed, confused postpartum \\"period of confinement.\\" In 1981 Crone moved to Louisiana to teach at Louisiana State University and began writing stories set in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, among them Oslo which appeared in The New Yorker The Louisiana stories were gathered in Dream State, often depicting the plight of \\"transplanted Northerners\\" who \\"feel trapped in Louisiana, where \\"all the big questions are still left open.. are women people, did Elvis die, was slavery wrong?\\" The New York Times Book Review praised her \\"fresh version of the Deep South, one that is exotic without being either grotesque or romanticized\\" and reported that \\"the sensibility embodied in Ms. Crone's energetic fiction ...is utterly sui generis.\\" Turning her attention to her childhood in eastern North Carolina, Crone's next collection What Gets Into Us recreates the life of a small town in the Carolinas, as seen across racial and class lines over a period from the 1950s to the present. Writing for Popmatters, Phoebe Kates Foster states: \\" What Gets Into Us is a complex and remarkable book that deserves to be read slowly and re-read meditatively. Like the works of Flannery O'Connor, this collection transcends the genre of \\"Southern Literature\\" and probes deeply into the paradoxes of the psyche and the zeitgeist of modern America...Crone has the lyric touch of a poet and the visionary spirit of a mystic, conjuring images that are both disturbing and startlingly beautiful. The reader will never forget Claire McKenzie's last memory of her mother or Sidney Byrd's symbolic dream about her dead friend Pauline or Lily Stark's stunning vision that closes this collection. Though Crone provides no easy way out for the tormented individuals of Fayton, North Carolina, there is redemption in this book. Like her characters, the reader just has to have faith in the midst of darkness and look for it. Recently Crone has ventured into speculative fiction with the 2012 publication of \\"The Not Yet\\", which Publishers Weekly described as \\"an impressive genre debut with a strong literary voice...\\". Reviewer Greg Langley, wrote: \\"... What Crone has combined is wry social commentary in the vein of Swift or Voltaire with a dystopian coming-of-age tale. It's a brilliant book full of adventure and humor and no small amount of pathos. Best of all, Crone uses her book to ask what it means to be human, a question all of us Nats need to keep asking ourselves. (Baton Rouge Advocate). The Not Yet was a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award for best science fiction of the year in paperback format. In 2014, she published The Ice Garden. (Carolina Wren, now Blair Publishing) 14 Awards Moira Crone has been selected for an individual artist's grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, (1990) and a fellowship at the Mary Ingraham Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College at Harvard, (1987-88.)

Cappellen F.C. is a Belgian football club from the town of Kapellen, near Antwerp. Cappellen has matricule number 43 and has yellow and red as main team colours. The club has a long history in the higher divisions of Belgian football. In the latter part of the 1960s the club dropped for a long time into the provincial leagues, however in the early 1990s it managed to climb back into Promotion. As of 2019–20 they are playing in the Belgian Second Amateur Division. History The club Cappellen Football Club was founded in 1906 by a few youngsters who were not able to play with Victoria FC, at that time the only team in town. Soon they got the club officially registered. For the first few years the team played in the provincial leagues, but when in 1926 the national level of football in Belgium was extended with a third division, Cappellen got auto-promoted and thus managed to play on a national level for the first time. Cappellen was able to keep up with the pace and even managed to end in the top few several times, ultimately leading to the team attaining promotion into the second division at the end of the 1932 season. Again Cappellen seemed to have few trouble in scoring points and in the 1935–36 season they even ended in fourth position, just two points away from direct promotion into the highest division. However just before the second world war, Capellen got demoted into third division again. After the war Cappellen managed to climb back into second division during the 1946 season, but they immediately dropped back into third that season. In 1952, the structure of the Belgian league was altered to lower the number of teams in the higher divisions and to introduce a fourth national level, Cappellen remained in the promotion-division, but this was now fourth instead of third national level. The club never managed to regain promotion into third level and eventually it even dropped into the provincial leagues again in 1958. From 1961 until 1967 the team spent a few seasons in the promotion division again, but then sunk deep into the provincial leagues for many years. It was only in 1989 that Cappellen managed to re-enter at national level into the promotion division which was rapidly followed by yet another promotion in 1991 to the third division. Even there Cappellen showed some good results as they ended in second position for three years in a row. In 1995 however they finally managed to win the division and as such the team was promoted into the second division, exactly half a century after they last played at that level. Since 2000 Cappellen is playing in the third division again with varying results.

Origin The ship, along with her three sister ships , and , had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. Aetos was originally named San Luis. Greek purchase They were purchased in 1912 by Greece, ready for delivery, each for the sum of £148,000, when the Balkan Wars seemed likely.http://www.hellenicnavy.gr/aetos12_46_en.asp (2008) Hellenic Navy Official website. The four ships were sailed with a non-Greek crew to Algiers, to meet the requisitioned personnel transport ship Ionia which contained the Greek crews for the ships. When Aetos entered the Mediterranean she went adrift due to a serious engine breakdown. By pure coincidence one of the other destroyers passed nearby and towed Aetos to Algiers. Service history During the Balkan Wars, the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition. Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship, and for this reason these ships were initially named 'scouts' rather than 'destroyers'. She was under the command of Commander A. Douroutis, RHN. During the First World War, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente. Due to Greece's neutrality, the four Aetos-class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November, and served in the French Navy from 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. Aetos participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918 and saw action in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea. After the war, Aetos was extensively rebuilt by the J Samuel White yard from 1925–1927 and emerged as a much more modern unit. Four Yarrow boilers replaced her five original units with 5 funnels reduced to two. This allowed the bridge to be moved further aft reducing spray and allowed a deckhouse to be built forward of it for a super firing 4-inch gun. One more gun between the funnels and one on the quarterdeck aft with two single Pom Pom's completed the gun armament. Torpedo tubes were increased to 2 triple mounts and a Vickers director fire control as was fitted. Aetos participated in the Second World War. After surviving the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Aetos served under the operational control of the Royal Navy based in the Indian Ocean, where despite her age she served with distinction. Further modifications included new anti-aircraft guns, and anti-submarine weapons. After the end of the Second World War, Aetos was stricken in 1945.

His appointment was controversial due to his religion; The Nawab's decision of elevating Mohanlal to the prominent position of his supreme Diwan caused the Muslim nobility, and in particular Mir Jafar, to take great offense. Mir Jafar was then the head of the armed forces, second only to the Nawab, and the elevation of a Hindu to a post above him was taken almost as a personal insult. Mohan LAL was born in early eighteenth century in a Royal Yadav LAL family of Purnea. He became one of the powerful vassal king of Purnea, when Ali Vardi Khan took the chair of Deputy Governor of Bihar in1733.He was the close friend of Jainuddin Ahmed son-in-law of Ali Vardi Khan. Jainuddin Ahmed took the charge of Deputy Governor of Bihar in a 1741. 1748 Jainuddin Ahmed was killed in a Maratha attack. Sarajuddullah appointed Nayeb Nazim of Bihar and Raja Mohan LAL was appointed his adviser and trainer. In 1752 Ali Vardi Khan appointed Mohan LAL as one of the general and allotted a house at Kalandarbag, Murshidabad.Sirajuddullah took the chair of Nawab on 15th April 1756 and Raja Mohan LAL was appointed Peskar.(page 211 and 213 of The Yadavs of India.isbn:978-93-83895-39-7.). On the day of 23 June 1757 in the Battle of Plassey, Siraj ud-Daulah faced off against the British, apparently with overwhelming force, but at the critical time Mir Jafar's men stood watching passively while the soldiers of Siraj ud-Daulah were decimated by the smaller but much better armed British forces. In the said 'so called' battle Mohanlal and his fellow leader Mir Madan fought on the side of the Nawab's Army. After the death of Mir Madan, he wanted to attack the British army rapidly and advised Siraj ud-Daulah that the decision of retreat may be fatal for the Nawab. But the Nawab was already misguided by Mir Jafar did not consider Mohanlal's opinion. Mohanlal was born in early eighteen century in a royal maithili karna kayastha family of Purnea.On the other hand , according to Anukulchandra Chakraborty (Anukul Thakur) Mohanlal belonged to a mahishya family.Anukulchandra Chakraborty mentioned this in one of his lectures later on published in book form titled Nana Prasange Vol. iv .He married Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah's younger sister Shahzadi Afseen Begum; they had two sons and a daughter: Raja Sreemant Lal, Hukka Lal and Galibunnessa. Raja Mohanlal was appointed \\"Peskar\\" by Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah on 16 April 1756 and conferred \\"Maharaja\\" after Manihari War on 16 October 1756. An apocryphal story without any proof is that of a sister of Mohanlal. The story goes that he had a younger sister, Madhabilata, who was kidnapped by the Portuguese in a rebellion during her childhood. When she grew older, she was appointed as dancer or tawaif by Mir Jafar, who renamed her as 'Faizi Bai'. And sent her to secretly spy on the Nawab under a deal with East India Company wherein she was to be handsomely paid if she could assassinate the Nawab. It's said that the Nawab suspected that Faizi was a spy, but didn't confront her on it and let her continue in his court as 'Alia'. This saddened Siraj's wife Lutfunnisa Begum, which made the Nawab arrest Alia; Mohanlal did not protest as he seemed to suspect her ulterior motives or perhaps because of his strong loyalties with the Nawab Mohanlal's son-in-law Bahadur Ali Khan was killed on 23 June 1757 in the battle of Plassey .His elder son Raja Srimanta Lal of Purnea was killed by order of Miran, son of Nawab Mir Jafar. Raja Srimanta Lal's great grandson Dharamchand Lal's son Raja Prithvi Chand Lal was the last Raja of Royal Yadav Lal family of Purnea who expired in 1953. He was well known for horse-racing and well known social worker close to mahatma Gandhi. He was proud as a Yadav and a descendant of Maharaja Mohan LAL and one of the main organizer of First All India Yadav Mahasabha meeting on 17to20th April 1924 in Purnea Bihar. MohanLal's younger son Hukka Lal took up refuge in Juranpur Kali Pith in the Nadia district of West Bengal. Hukka Lal's descendants are still living in Juranpur and adjacent area . In popular culture Mohanlal has been portrayed as a great patriot and the most trusted lieutenant of the nawab in the famous Bangladeshi movie Sirajud Daulah as well as in Indian movie Ami Sirajer Begum. Bengali poet Nabinchandra Sen also symbolized his heroic resistance in his poem Palashir Juddho and in the drama of Sachindranath Sengupta Sirajudullah.  Myth  It was stated that after the defeat of the battle of Plassey he fled to Mymensingh to save Siraj's child from the henchmen of Miran. Later he took shelter in different places of Bengal such as Juranpur village Kali temple, a Shakti Peetha of Nadia district and Brindabanchandra Mandir at Guptipara, Hooghly. Few sources referred that Guptipara is the birthplace of Diwan Mohanlal.

He was among a small group of Northern-born Confederate generals. Early life York was a native of Avon, Maine. His grandfather was aide-de-camp to General George Washington during the American Revolution and was present at the surrender of Lord Cornwallis following the Battle of Yorktown. York graduated from Transylvania University in Kentucky, and then studied law at the University of Louisiana. He was a pre-war lawyer and cotton planter in the state of Louisiana. Civil War When the state seceded from the Union in early 1861, York organized a company of the 14th Louisiana Infantry and served as its first captain. He was successively promoted to major and lieutenant colonel, and fought in the Peninsula Campaign in the summer of 1862. He was wounded during the Battle of Williamsburg. He displayed personal bravery and good military judgement during the Seven Days Battles and was promoted to an opening as the regiment's colonel in August 1862. Colonel York led the 14th Louisiana in the battles of Second Manassas (being wounded a second time), Antietam, and Fredericksburg. In the winter and spring of 1863, he returned to Louisiana on recruiting duty to help replenish the dwindling ranks of his regiment. He returned in time for the Gettysburg Campaign and the subsequent Bristoe Campaign and Mine Run Campaign. In 1864, York participated in the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House. He was promoted to brigadier general in May and assigned command of the combination of two depleted Louisiana brigades previously led by Harry T. Hays and Leroy A. Stafford. Serving in the division of John B. Gordon in Jubal A. Early's Army of the Valley, York fought in many of the battles and skirmishes in Early's Raid on Washington, including the Battle of Monocacy in Maryland. He was severely wounded in the Shenandoah Valley at the Battle of Opequon and incapacitated for any further field service. After his lengthy recuperation, York was assigned to recruiting duty in various prisoner-of-war camps. After the fall of Richmond, York and a small number of troops and artillery successfully defended the Yadkin River Bridge from an attack by Stoneman's Raiders, enabling fleeing President Jefferson Davis to evade capture for some time. Postbellum Following the war, York returned to Vidalia, Louisiana, to find that all six of his sprawling plantations had been destroyed. Undaunted, he opened and ran a profitable hotel, the York House, across the river in Natchez. He also purchased five steamboats and began delivering people, cargo, and livestock to rural areas. In 1882, his steamboats helped deliver relief supplies to flood victims. Zebulon York died in Natchez, Mississippi, and is buried in Natchez City Cemetery.

In addition to Winter himself, the band known as Johnny Winter And included guitarist Rick Derringer and bassist Randy Jo Hobbs, both former members of the McCoys, and drummer Bobby Caldwell. Caldwell had replaced another ex-McCoy, Rick Derringer's brother Randy Zehringer, after the group recorded their eponymous studio album a few months earlier.

Critical reception Bruce Eder of AllMusic wrote, \\"In its time, this was an enormously popular live album, especially among high-school kids just starting to discover blues- rock in the early '70s. Derived from live performances at the Fillmore East and at Pirate's World in Dania, Florida, it is probably, in fairness, the best representation of Johnny Winter's sound from his prime years that one is likely to find — the pity is that it's only about 40 minutes long, and is weighted very heavily toward Winter's covers of well-known rock & roll numbers....

Sagar became the last of approximately 1,300 refugees from the Middle East to be detained on Nauru under the Australian Government's \\"Pacific Solution\\" after an adverse security assessment was issued by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). He resettled in Sweden in 2007 after the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' efforts to secure asylum in a third country finally met with success. Experiences as a refugee At the age of 15, Sagar fled Najaf with his family during the massacre which followed the 1991 Shi'a Muslim uprising against Sadaam Hussein. Upon their return, his family found their home destroyed by a rocket, and Sagar was injured by an unexploded bomb as he helped to clear rubble. In 1997, after hearing rumours that his family was in danger, Sagar abandoned his microbiology studies and fled Iraq for Iran with his parents and siblings. In May 2001, he left Iran alone, travelling to Malaysia and Indonesia.James Button, A long road to justice, The Age, 4 August 2007. In October 2001, he boarded the Olong, a boat bound for Australian waters carrying 223 asylum seekers. Shortly after entering Australian waters, the Olong, which was designated Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel IV (SIEV IV) by the Australian Government, was intercepted by the Australian Navy vessel HMAS Adelaide and forced to return to international waters. After SIEV IV sank, its passengers were rescued by the crew of the Adelaide.Major General R.M. Powell, The Report of the Routine Inquiry into Operation Relex: The Interception and Boarding of SIEV IV by HMAS Adelaide , 14 December 2001. The sinking of the SIEV IV triggered the children overboard scandal after then Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock, Defence Minister Peter Reith and Prime Minister John Howard falsely claimed that passengers of SIEV IV had thrown their own children overboard. Sagar was sent to Manus Island, Papua New Guinea with other asylum seekers from the SIEV IV. He was transferred to Nauru in September 2002. ASIO security assessment While on Nauru, Sagar was interviewed by officers from the ASIO. In August 2005, Sagar and another Iraqi refugee, Muhammad Faisal, were notified that they had been assessed to represent a \\"risk to Australia's national security\\" and therefore would not be permitted to settle in Australia. Neither Faisal nor Sagar were informed of the reasons for the adverse assessment. ASIO's adverse assessments effectively exposed Sagar and Faisal to the prospect of indefinite detention on Nauru, despite the Australian Government's recognition that their fears of persecution if returned to Iraq were genuine. The adverse assessments also undermined attempts by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to secure asylum for Sagar and Faisal in a country other than Australia.Michael Gordon, Last man standing, Sydney Morning Herald, 30 September 2006. While in detention, Sagar set up a website, Refugees Left on Nauru, on which he posted photographs of the almost deserted refugee camp and described the psychological challenges faced by the last two refugees remaining on the island: > There might be people who are not aware of the real meaning of the word > \\"detention.\\" It simply means that you do not own your life any more, or in > other words, you can't feel alive any more. Especially when you are held in > the same situation for a long time with no signs of any changes that might > happen in the near future.Archive of Refugees Left on Nauru website, 20 July > 2006. In September 2006, Faisal became suicidal and was evacuated to a hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where he was able to apply directly for asylum to the Australian Government. This triggered a second ASIO security assessment, which found that Faisal did not present a risk to national security. In early 2007 Faisal was granted a permanent visa and allowed to stay in Australia.Michael Gordon, Standing on Common Group, The Age, 1 February 2007. Sagar's adverse security assessment, however, remains intact. Federal Court case In February 2006, Sagar and Faisal launched civil action against the Director- General of Security, Paul O'Sullivan in the Federal Court of Australia, seeking orders to quash the adverse security assessments.Federal Court of Australia, Parkin v O'Sullivan (2006) FCA 1413, 3 November 2006 On November 3, 2006 the ABC reported that Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal, along with deported US peace activist Scott Parkin won \\"the right to know why ASIO gave them adverse security assessments\\".Deported activist, asylum seekers win access to ASIO files, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, November 3, 2006 ASIO subsequently appealed to the full court. Justices Ryan, North and Jessup are due to deliver their judgement on 18 July.Federal Court of Australia website Settlement in Sweden In December 2006, the Swedish Government agreed to allow Sagar to settle in that country.*Michael Gordon, Loneliest refugee finds a home, The Age, 4 December 2006.

Formation and Siege of Corinth  The 17th Wisconsin was recruited principally from the Irish Population of the State. The regimental organization was effected under the management of Col. John L. Dornan at Camp Randall, Madison. The muster into the United States Service was completed on 15 March 1862, and the regiment left the State on the 23rd for St. Louis, Missouri. On their arrival at St. Louis, they were quartered at Benton Barracks until 10 April, when they embarked and proceeded up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, where they landed and encamped. Here they were assigned to the Sixth Division, under command of General McKean, and moved forward with the division early in May, and took part in the investment of Corinth, the division being located near the center of General Halleck's army. Col. Dornan was placed in command of the First Brigade, which was composed of the 16th and 17th Wisconsin, and two Missouri Regiments. On the 24th of May, the brigade was placed under the command of General McArthur. During the time the regiment was in front of Corinth, it suffered severely from sickness, notwithstanding which, it was actively engaged in duties of the siege, and on picket duty until the evacuation of the place on the 29th, when it advanced with the division and the army took possession of the town. On 6 June, the division went into Camp about a mile south of the town, where they remained during the summer, engaged in the performance of garrison duty in the fortifications and police duty. About 1 October, Company A, under Capt. McCauley, while on detached duty guarding the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, a few miles north of Corinth, had a brisk skirmish with a regiment of rebel cavalry who were destroying the track, and succeeded in driving them off with the loss of thirteen killed and wounded, and a number of horses and equipment's, which were captured by Co. A.  Battle of Corinth  In the Battle of Corinth, the 17th took part with the division of General McArthur. On the morning of the 3rd of October, the regiment was encamped on the Chewalla Road, along which the enemy was approaching driving in the Union forces which had been sent out to watch his motions. The regiment was marched out the Chewalla road a short distance, when it was countermarched to a position south of the Memphis Railroad, where it formed in line of battle with the rest of McArthur's division in the rear of Battery F, about three miles from Corinth, on the left of the Union line, which was under Gen. McKean. About 11 o'clock, the enemy pressed so hotly upon the forces of Gen. Davies who was on the right of McKean, that they were driven back, which made a gap in the lines of which the enemy took advantage and gained the camps of the 17th Wisconsin and the 21st Missouri. A force was sent forward which failed to drive back the enemy, when the whole division went to their aid. The enemy endeavored to outflank them. The Seventeenth occupied the right of the line, and was ordered by the commanding officer, to charge upon the enemy. This was handsomely done, the regiment advancing rapidly, led by its field officers. A brigade of the rebels, consisting of four Mississippi regiments, was charged upon and driven out of the camps, and a considerable distance beyond, when the enemy appearing in overwhelming numbers, the regiment was ordered to fallback to the line of the division. The gallant charge of the Seventeenth was highly complimented by the commanding officers. The division fell back before the superior numbers of the enemy until it attained a position behind the interior works nearest Corinth. On the morning of the 4th the division was moved to another portion of the defenses near the Seminary, where it was engaged in the support of the batteries near that point. The enemy's main attack on the 4th was on the center and right, consequently McKeans forces were not as actively engaged as the day before. About 2 o'clock in the afternoon the enemy was found to be retreating towards the Hatchee River. With the rest of McArthur's division, the Seventeenth joined in the pursuit towards Ripley, after which they returned to Corinth and encamped. The casualties of the Seventeenth were 5 killed, 20 wounded.  Vicksburg campaign  In pursuance of orders of General Grant for a concentration of his forces, preparatory to his southward movement, the Seventeenth moved with the division on 2 November, and reached Grand Junction on the 5th. Here Co. A, which had been on detached duty since July, rejoined the regiment. The regiment was transferred to the Second Brigade, commanded by Col. Bouck. On the 25th, Colonel Doran resigned, and Lieut. Col. Malloy was appointed Colonel, Major McMahon Lieut. Col., and Adjutant Plunkett, Major. Marching on the 28th, under Col. Malloy, the regiment took part in the southward movement of the army of General Grant, advancing to Waterford, crossing the Tallahatchie and reaching Abbeville, from whence, on 18 December, they continued their route southward until news was received of the capture of Holly Springs on the 21st. On the 22nd, under orders to proceed to Grand Junction, which was in danger of an attack, the regiment was immediately put in motion, leaving Company F, which was out on picket duty, and reached Grand Junction, forty miles distant, on the afternoon of the 23rd. In this vicinity they remained under arms expecting an attack, until 3 January, when they rejoined the division at Moscow, Tenn. On the 10th, the whole command proceeded to Memphis, arriving on the 13th, and on the 18th, embarking on transports, moved down the Mississippi, landing at Young's Point, just above Vicksburg on the 25th, where they were employed upon the celebrated canal by which General Grant proposed to run the rebel batteries. With General McArthur's division, on the 8th of February, they moved up the river to Lake Providence. Here they were engaged in the work of cutting a canal from the river to the lake for the purpose, if possible, of opening a route by water, which would enable General Grant to get his troops and supplies below Vicksburg. The Seventeenth remained here until the 20th of April, when it moved down the river to Milliken's Bend. On 25 April, Major Plunkett resigned, and Captain Donald Scott was appointed Major. With the forces then congregating below Vicksburg, the regiment, which was now in Ransom's brigade, proceeded across the Peninsula, to Carthage, near which they encamped until 10 May, on which day they resumed their onward movement, crossing the Mississippi at Grand Gulf on the 12th, and they marched to join the forces of General McPhearson, to whose corps they were attached, and who was then in position before Jackson. Reaching Raymond on the 16th, while the battle of Champion's Hill was in progress, the brigade was hurried forward, but did not arrive until the battle was over. Here the Seventeenth was ordered to support a battery. The enemy retiring, they were ordered forward in pursuit, and marched until midnight. The pursuit was renewed on the morning of the 17th, and the regiment reached the vicinity of Black River Bridge, soon after the capture of the enemy's position. Here they assisted in constructing the floating bridges, over which they crossed on the 18th, and marched to within a half a mile of the enemy's fortifications to the rear of Vicksburg, and bivouacked in a ravine. On 19 May, the Seventeenth took part in the assault on the enemy's works. At 10 o'clock, the regiment was formed, eight deep, with companies H and E in front. The whole brigade was to charge at a given signal, the Seventeenth being in the advance, led by Lieut. Col McMahon. Laying down where they were partially screened from the enemy's fire, they awaited the signal, which was at last given. Rising to their feet, the regiment presses forward, exposed to a murderous fire of musketry and artillery. Working their way over fallen timber and broken ground, they obtained a position in a ravine, within seventy-five yards of the enemy's works, which they held for about two hours. Owing to a misunderstanding in regard to the signal, the rest of the brigade did not follow up in support, and the regiment withdrew in good order. The Seventeenth, in this charge, exhibited the greatest bravery, and although unsupported, continued for two hours to occupy the position, under a severe fire of shot and shell. In the assault of the 22nd, the Seventeenth which had suffered severely in the charge of the 19th, was held as a reserve of the brigade. In the charge of the 22nd, the Ninety-fifth Illinois had the advance, followed by the Eleventh and Seventy-second Illinois, and the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Wisconsin. The brigade sprang forward at the signal, but had hardly advanced twenty steps, when they were met By a terrible storm of grape and canister from the enemy's breastworks, which checked the advance of the column. General Ransom rushed to the head of the column, seized the colors of the Ninety-fifth, and waving them, he shouted for the men to follow. The column moved up and fought a while across the breastworks, when, being satisfied that they could not be stormed, General Ransom ordered the Illinois regiments to fall back, one regiment at a time, and in order, and slowly, or the first man who attempted to run or go beyond the ravine, would be shot. \\"The Seventeenth Wisconsin will remain to cover the movement,\\" was the order of the brave General; an order highly complimentary to the regiment designated. The casualties of the several assaults on Vicksburg were 14 dead, 50 wounded. After this last assault, General Grant determined on a regular siege, and accordingly the investing forces were engaged in the construction of regular approaches, and other operations of that siege, until the enemy capitulated, on 4 July. On that day, the Brigade of General Ransom was the first to enter the captured city, the Fourteenth Wisconsin on the right and leading, the brigade having earned the post of honor by the indomitable bravery and energy it had displayed during the siege, having dug and fought its way so near the rebel works, that the contending forces could almost cross bayonets from the trenches.  Occupation of Natchez and Trinity expedition  The brigade went into camp the next day within the old line of works, where they remained until the 12th, when they embarked and proceeded to Natchez, of which place General Ransom took possession on the 14th. Here the regiment was employed in picket and guard duty, and on 24 August, were furnished with horses, and employed as mounted infantry. On the 1 September, Col. Malloy, with 300 men of the Seventeenth, moved out about thirty miles, to Trinity, in the state of Louisiana. Here the rebels gave them a warm reception, but they were soon routed. It was necessary to procure transportation across the Black River, which runs through the town. Two men of Captain Geraughty's company, swan the river, under the severe fire of the enemy, and brought back a small boat, in which the command crossed. The enemy did not abandon his position till two companies had crossed. They were pursued some distance. On the return of our forces, a rebel steamer, loaded with quartermaster and commissary stores, hove in sight. She was taken possession of and destroyed, with her cargo, by Col. Malloy's command. Col. Malloy next day fell back to the main body of the brigade, at Cross Bayou. They were again sent forward, and recrossed the Black River, and occupied Trinity. The main force joining them the next day, they were ordered forward 11 miles, to the crossing of the Alexandria and Trinity roads. Here they routed the enemy, whom they hotly pursued for nine miles, capturing several prisoners, and having one man killed and four wounded. On 4 September, they made their appearance before Ft. Beauregard, a considerable earthwork, built for defending the approaches to the town of Harrisonburg. The enemy fled at their approach, abandoning the fort and its guns, though it was capable of making an obstinate resistance. The Seventeenth immediately took possession, capturing three brass six pounders, two thirty-two pound siege guns, and a twenty-four pound howitzer, besides caissons and ammunition. They also capture a large Confederate flag. They subsequently destroyed a grist mill in the vicinity, and a lot of Confederate cotton and commissary stores, after which they rejoined the brigade, and returned to Natchez. The Seventeenth remained at Natchez, engaged in scouting and skirmishing occasionally with the enemy, until the last of October, when they moved with the Brigade to Vicksburg, where they were occupied during the winter in camp and guard duty. In January 1864, seven- eighths of the regiment reenlisted, which constituted it a veteran regiment. On 8 March, they left Vicksburg, en route for Wisconsin, to take their veteran furlough, and arrived at Madison on the 18th, where they were welcomed by the State authorities and citizens. They disbursed to their several homes, and reassembled at Camp Washburn, Milwaukee, on 20 April. On the next day they proceeded to Cairo, arriving on the 22nd, where they found the Seventeenth Corps, to which they were attached, and which was on its way to join the forces of General Sherman, in the Atlanta campaign. Here it was assigned to the Second Brigade, of General Gresham's forces. Colonel Malloy was placed in command of the brigade, Lieut. Col. McMahon being in command of the regiment. They embarked for the Tennessee River on 4 May, and reached Clifton, Tenn., thence marched to Huntsville, Ala., where the Seventeenth was transferred to the Third Brigade, Third Division, General Leggett. Col. Malloy was placed in command of the brigade. On the 5th, they commenced their long march to join the forces of Gen. Sherman, who was then advancing against Atlanta. Proceeding by way of Warrenton and Rome, Ga., they reached Ackworth, near where Gen. Sherman's forces were in position, on 8 June.  Atlanta campaign  On 10 June, the regiment took position near Big Shanty, in front of the enemy, the division occupying the extreme left of the line. They were constantly occupied in heavy skirmishing until the 19th, when the division advanced, taking position on Brush Mountain. During this they suffered 2 deaths and 6 wounded. On the 22nd, they took part in a demonstration on the enemy's right, carrying two lines of rifle pits. After sustaining a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery for over three hours, they returned to the vicinity of Brush Mountain. With the division they took part in the operations against Kenesaw Mountain where they sustained casualties of 2 dead and 11 wounded. The Seventeenth accompanied the movement of McPherson's corps, to the right of Kennesaw Mountain, on 2 July, in the subsequent movement of the Third Division, prior to the crossing of the Chattahoochie, on 17 July, sustaining losses of 1 dead, 3 wounded. Crossing the river with the Third Division on the 17th, the regiment marched through Decatur, and on the 20th, occupied with the division, a portion of the extreme left of the line, to the south of the Augusta Railroad, in front of Bald Hill. On 21 July, the Third Division, General Legget, led by the brigade of General Force, the Twelfth and Sixteenth Wisconsin in the advance, charged up the hill upon the enemy's works, and after a fierce struggle, drove the rebels out, and took possession of the hill. On the 22nd the enemy attempted to retake possession of their captured works, but after a hard struggle, the Third Division succeeded in holding the ground, and with the aid of the Sixteenth Corps, who attacked the enemy in the rear, finally drove the rebels into their works. In this severe contest of 21 and 22 July, the Seventieth Wisconsin was actively involved and lost 4 to death and 11 wounded. The Seventeenth Regiment accompanied the movement of the Seventeenth Corps to the right on 26 July, and continued in the duties of the siege, until 26 August, when it took part in the operations of the Seventeenth Corps to the south of Atlanta, being present at the battle of Jonesboro, and Lovejoy Station, returning with the Seventeenth Corps and camping near Atlanta, on 9 September. On 24 August, Lieut. Col. McMahon was discharged and Major Scott was appointed Lieut. Colonel, and Captain McCauley, Major. The losses in the vicinity of Atlanta were 11.  Sherman's March to the Sea  With the rest of the Seventeenth Corps, the Seventeenth regiment left East Point, where it had been encamped, and crossed the Chattahoochie, in pursuit of the rebel General Hood. From this pursuit they returned to Marietta, and encamped on 4 November, where they remained until the 13th, when they moved to Atlanta, and on the 16th, began the grand march for Savannah. The Seventeenth, on the march, engaged in the different duties engaged upon the different regiments, and nothing particular occurred to vary the operations of the Seventeenth, and its history is similar to most of the other regiments engaged. With the Seventeenth Corps, it left Savannah in January, and camped near Beauford, S.C., and joined in the march to Goldsboro. Col. Malloy was home on leave of absence when General Sherman started for Savannah. He consequently reported himself to major General Steadman, at Chattanooga, who was appointed By General Sherman to the duty of taking charge of such furloughed soldiers or officers of his army who might report themselves after he had cut loose and started his march. These persons were to rejoin their respective organizations on hearing of his arrival at the seacoast. The organization of these detachments into a Provisional Division had been assigned to Brigadier General Charles Cruft. By him Col. Malloy was placed in command of all the available men in the camp of the Seventeenth Corps Detachment, and ordered to occupy all the blockhouses along the line of the Georgia State Railroad, and garrison Tunnel Hill and Ringgold. In a short time Col. Malloy had a full brigade under his command. Hood was making preparations to attack Thomas at Nashville, and the forces of Col. Malloy, on the 30th of November, started from Chattanooga by rail, reaching that city the next day. Col. Malloy's brigade occupied several different positions during the period that Hood threatened Nashville, and on the days of the battle were posted on the right of Fort Negley, in the works. They were afterwards sent to Decatur, Ala., and other points in the performance of severe and arduous duty. These detachments of new recruits, returning veterans and others, were ordered to rendezvous at Stevenson, Ala., on the 13th of January, thence they moved to Nashville, where the various commands were organized into three brigades, all of which on 17, 18 and 19 January 1865, embarked on steamers en route to join their commands in Sherman's army, by way of the Cumberland and Ohio Rivers. General Francis Meagher had command of the Provisional Division. The troops on the boat suffered severely for want of fires, and their commissary arrangements were not of the best. Colonel Malloy visited Wisconsin and joined his brigade after their arrival at Beauford, N. C.. On reaching Ohio they were compelled to take cars, the river not being navigable, and proceeded by way of Pittsburg and Pennsylvania Central Railroad to Baltimore, thence to Annapolis, where they took steamers and proceeded to Beauford, N.C., arriving there on 8 February 1865, from whence they moved by rail to New Bern, on the 12th.  Carolinas Campaign  On their arrival at New Bern, General Meagher assumed command of the Provisional Division, and had the general management of its affairs. Much dissatisfaction being produced, the general was relieved from duty on the 2nd of March, by General Cox. The brigades composing the Provisional Division, were attached to the divisions of Generals Carter and Palmer, in the army under General Cox, and made their way towards Goldsboro to cooperate with General Sherman. On their way they encountered the rebel General Hoke, and sundry skirmishes took place which resulted in favor of the Union arms. Reaching Goldsboro on 21 of March, on the 23rd, the forces of General Sherman made their appearance, when the Provisional Division was broken up by that General's order, and the members sent to their respective regiments. In this Provisional Division, about 1,000 Wisconsin men were incorporated, including the veterans of the Eighteenth Regiment. Col. Malloy and Lieut. Col. Scott rejoined the Seventeenth Regiment and accompanied it on the march to Raleigh, and after the surrender of Johnston, proceeded to Richmond and Washington, where they took part in the Grand Review of the troops of General Sherman in May, and thence proceeded to Louisville to muster out. They left that city on 14 July, and reached Madison on the 17th where they were publicly received and paid off, and the regiment disbanded. For meritorious services during the war, Col. Malloy was brevetted Brigadier General.  Casualties  The 17th Wisconsin suffered 41 enlisted men killed in action or who later died of their wounds, plus another 228 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 269 fatalities.

For various places in France and Belgium, see Saint-Symphorien. Symphorian (Symphorianus, Symphorien), Timotheus (Timothy), and Hippolytus of Rome are three Christian martyrs who though they were unrelated and were killed in different places and at different times, shared a common feast day in the General Roman Calendar from at least the 1568 Tridentine Calendar to the Mysterii Paschalis. While still a young man, Symphorian was either beheaded or beaten to death with clubs. Symphorian According to a legendary passio of St. Benignus of Dijon, Symphorian was a young nobleman who was converted by Benignus at Autun. Symphorian was beheaded, while still a young man, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.Meier, Gabriel. \\"Sts. Timotheus and Symphorian.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 9 February 2019 He was the son of a senator named Faustus. He studied at Autun and was brought before the provincial governor Heraclius for not worshipping the pagan goddess Cybele (Berecynthia), by failing to show due reverence when a procession during her festival was passing by. Symphorian is said to have asked for tools to destroy the statue. He was arrested and flogged and, because he was from a noble family, he was given a chance to recant but refused. His mother, the Blessed Augusta (?), encouraged him on his way to execution and was present at her son's death, which took place on 22 August 178. In the oldest redaction of manuscripts containing the saint's life we find a Gaulish sentence recorded that she allegedly yelled from the city wall: nate, nate, symphoriane, mentobeto to diuo which may be read as \\"gnate, gnate, mentobe to diwo\\" (\\"son, son, o symphorian, remember your god!\\").R. Thurneysen, \\"Irisches und Gallisches,\\" in: Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie 14 (1923) 1-17. Symphorian was beaten to death with clubs. =Veneration= Bishop Euphronius of Autun (died 490) built a handsome church over Symphorian's grave, connected with a monastery, the Abbey of St. Symphorian, which belonged to the Congregation of Sainte-Geneviève from 1656 until its suppression in 1791. Abbot Germanus later became Bishop of Paris, where he dedicated a chapel to the saint. Genesius of Clermont built a church dedicated to him at Clermont. Saint Symphorian is the patron saint of Autun. His veneration spread at an early date through the empire of the Franks. His cult was especially popular at Tours; Saint Gregory of Tours relates a miracle performed by the saint. There is a St. Symphorian's Church at Veryan, Cornwall, and another at Durrington in West Sussex, now a suburb of the town of Worthing. Timotheus During the pontificate of Melchiades (311–13), St. Timotheus came from Antioch to Rome, where he preached for fifteen months and lived with Sylvester, who later became pope. The prefect of the city, Tarquinus Perpenna, threw him into prison, tortured, and finally beheaded him at the Via Ostiense in 311. A Christian woman named Theon buried him in her garden. This is related in the legend of Sylvester. The name of Timotheus occurs in the earliest martyrologies. Hippolytus The 22 August feast of Saint Hippolytus of Rome was a duplicate of his 13 August feast and for that reason was deleted when the General Roman Calendar was revised in 1969.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 135 Earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology referred to the 22 August Hippolytus as Bishop of Porto. Johann Peter Kirsch, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, sees this as \\"connected with the confusion regarding the Roman presbyter resulting from the Acts of the Martyrs of Porto. It has not been ascertained whether the memory of the latter was localized at Porto merely in connection with the legend in Prudentius, without further foundation, or whether a person named Hippolytus was really martyred at Porto, and afterwards confounded in legend with Hippolytus of Rome.\\"Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Sts.

Early life and education  Betty Woodman was born in Norwalk, Connecticut, to Minnie and Henry Abrahams. Her parents were progressive socialists and her mother promoted a feminist viewpoint. During seventh grade, stifled by the home economics courses young women were relegated to, she successfully fought her way into a wood shop class, wherein she learned to use a lathe. Betty started pottery classes at age 16 and immediately took to clay. She attended the School for American Craftsmen at Alfred University in New York from 1948 until 1950.  Career  Woodman began her career in the 1950s as a production potter. Her career moved from functional pottery to fresh and exuberant art culminating in a retrospective show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2006, the first such retrospective for a living, female ceramicist, and a solo show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2016 with the title Theatre of the Domestic. She was a professor of art at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1978-1998. Following her daughter's death in 1981, Woodman's work subsequently shifted, evolving from functional pottery to the more abstract, thus transforming her career. She received an honorary doctorate from CU in 2007. Woodman convinced city of Boulder officials in the 1950s to fund the Pottery Lab, making it one of the first recreational pottery programs in the U.S. Her vision was to have students make pottery for fun but also develop their craft into a career. The Pottery Lab's creation resulted in around 100 kilns being constructed in the Boulder area.  Family  Betty Woodman met George Woodman in a pottery class she was teaching in Boston in 1950. They married in 1953. George Woodman was a painter and photographer. He headed the University of Colorado Boulder art department. He died in March 2017. Betty and George Woodman had two children. Their daughter, Francesa Woodman, was an acclaimed photographer who took her life in 1981 at age 22. Their son, Charles Woodman, is an artist.

Description Growing to tall by wide, it is a woodland herbaceous perennial flowering in spring, with lemon yellow scented blooms. The large stalkless triple leaves often have grey-green marbling on the surface. It flowers in April-May beneath the bare branches of deciduous trees. After flowering and setting seed it goes dormant in summer, before appearing again in late winter. Taxonomy Trillium luteum was first described by Muhlenberg in 1813 as T. sessile var. luteum but the taxon was later given specific rank by Harbison. Given this history, it's not surprising that T. luteum is often sold under the name of T. sessile var. luteum, which has caused some confusion. It has also been known as T. cuneatum var. luteum (Muhl.) H.E. Ahles and T. viride var. luteum (Muhl.) Gleason. Distribution Trillium luteum has interbred extensively with T. cuneatum in its native range, forming numerous intermediate hybrids. Moreover, botanists in the past have confused it with the more western T. viride. It is therefore sometimes difficult to determine the true range of purebred T. luteum specimens. The main population appears to reside in Eastern Tennessee, extending into North Carolina and Georgia. It is especially abundant around Gatlinburg. The species also occurs in Kentucky, and in scattered locations farther north, in Ontario, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland and northern Virginia, but these appear to be naturalized populations.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map Cultivation Though hardy down to , this plant requires a sheltered position with rich, moist leafmould in a shaded, deciduous woodland setting which mimics its native habitat in North American broadleaf forests.

Bill Bixby reprises his role as Dr. David Bruce Banner and Lou Ferrigno returns to play the Hulk. It was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to Bill Bixby's death in 1993, there was talk of a movie The Revenge of the Incredible Hulk television movie which would resurrect the character.  Plot  David Banner (Bill Bixby) masquerades as David Bellamy, a mentally challenged janitor, to gain access to a scientific research facility in Portland, Oregon. He believes that the studies of one of the scientists there, Dr. Ronald Pratt (Philip Sterling), may hold the key to curing his gamma-induced condition that, in times of stress, turns him into a superhuman green creature known as the Hulk. One night after making a transaction at the bank, David is trapped by street thieves and is beaten and robbed. The stress of his injuries induces another transformation. The Hulk makes short work of the criminals but attracts the attention of authorities before escaping. The next day, bypassing security, Banner enters Pratt's laboratory and examines the formula on his blackboard, making corrections. At the same time, a Russian spy named Jasmin (Elizabeth Gracen), thinking she has completed her last act of espionage, is approached by former superior Kasha for one last job: infiltrate Pratt's lab and steal the files on his experiments. When she refuses, Kasha blackmails Jasmin with her sister Bella's life. Jasmin then disguises herself and obtains a fingerprint from one of the security guards. The following morning, Pratt examines the formula on his blackboard and discovers that it is now correct. Determined to find out who is guiding him, he hides in the lab in wait for his secret helper. He catches David in the act and asks him to tell him something that would keep him from sounding the security alarm. Banner reveals his true identity and recounts the events that led to his self-experimentation that resulted in the Hulk. He notes that his condition also dives into Pratt's own research on a human's capacity to heal, for in Hulk-form David's accelerated metabolism allows any wound to close in seconds, leaving him with hardly a scar. Pratt believes he can cure David, but he needs to first study the creature. Over the course of a week, both scientists, with the help of Pratt's scientist wife Amy (Barbara Tarbuck), construct a force field cage and sensors to track Banner's vitals. On the night of the observation, David is rigged with a tranquilizer to sedate him once the readings have been recorded. Banner shocks himself with an electrical rod and transforms into the Hulk. The energy cage restrains the Hulk until Pratt has his readings, and Amy activates the tranquilizer. Banner reverts to normal, and Pratt and Amy photograph the closing puncture wound from the tranquilizer. Banner later watches the video of his transformation – claiming it is the first time he has seen the Hulk – and fails to see any humanity in him despite Amy's beliefs. The next day, the facility's board announces to Pratt that they are pulling his funding for his lack of results, which forces him to move up his proposed cure for David. An eastern European spy network dedicated to using Pratt's (and Banner's) work for corrupt purposes breaks into the lab, halting the experiment and kidnapping the Pratts. Banner has fallen in love with Jasmin, who returns his affections, and with her help, he rushes to the Pratts' aid. While pursuing the kidnappers, Banner and Jasmin learn that her sister, Bella (Anna Katarina), is the true leader of the spy network, and Banner turns into the Hulk, who tries to protect Pratt and Jasmin. The Hulk runs towards the plane, on which Bella and Zed are attempting to escape, and breaks it open. He climbs aboard before takeoff. Bella tries to shoot the Hulk, but ends up shooting the fuel tank below. As a result, the plane explodes, killing the villains and the Hulk is thrown into the night, falling onto the concrete. After one last return transformation, Banner tells Jasmin he is free, then succumbs to his injuries. Jasmin, Pratt, and Amy mourn for him.

As of early July 1989, it was still firmly expected to do so, and to air that autumn, with Iron Man under consideration for a follow-up. = Canceled sequel = Despite the Hulk's death in the 1990 film, the movie's makers had intended from the start for him to return in The Revenge of the Incredible Hulk, again with Gerald Di Pego as writer. As of July 10, 1990, a script was being written. It has been reported that the fourth film would have featured the Hulk with Banner's mind,The Incredible Lou, Papa Llama's Convention Report, 7 November 2008. and that the project was canceled because of Bill Bixby's struggle with cancer, but Di Pego has refuted both these claims as fan rumors, pointing out that Bixby's health had not yet begun to decline at the time the film was canceled. Di Pego said that the plot for The Revenge of the Incredible Hulk began with Banner being revived, but no longer able to change into the Hulk. Banner then begins to work for the government in order to prevent accidents like the one that turned him into the Hulk, but is captured by villains and coerced into turning their agents into Hulk-like beings. According to Di Pego, at the film's climax Banner would be forced to recreate the accident that transformed him into the Hulk in order to stop the villains' plans. The sequel was canceled because of the disappointing ratings for The Death of the Incredible Hulk. Home media This telefilm was originally released on VHS by Rhino Home Video in 1992. It was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment (distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment as of 2020) on June 3, 2003.

The fossil bones were found in the Lecho Formation at estancia El Brete, Argentina.\\"Yungavolucris brevipedalis\\" means \\"Short-footed Yungas bird\\". The generic name, Yungavolucris is after the Yungas region + the Latin volucris, which translates to \\"bird\\" (literally \\"flyer\\"). The specific name brevipedalis is from the Latin brevis, which means \\"short\\", + pedalis, from the Latin pes, meaning \\"foot\\".  Description  The only remains of Yungavolucris discovered so far consist of several tarsometatarsals, of which only the holotype (PVL-4053) is nearly complete. These tarsometatarsals are unusually very stout and flat, and also very wide at the lower end. These specimens are small, just over 4 cm (1.5 inches) long, and if its legs and feet were not excessively shortened in relation to the body, the bird was about the size of a large blackbird in life. The width of the bone is considerable though, being about twice the width of the tarsometatarsals of Lectavis and Soroavisaurus, two of its contemporaries. Thus, if the leg and foot only shortened and did not also become wider, it might be expected to have been a heavily built, sluggish and maybe even flightless bird the size of a large chicken. Metatarsal IV ( the outermost bone of the tarsometatarsus) is very thin and diminished, but nevertheless about the same length as metatarsal III (the middle bone of the tarsometatarsus). In addition, the end of metatarsal III is bent outwards, to a position that would in other birds fall between toes 3 and 4. Metatarsal II (the innermost preserved bone of the tarsometatarsus) has a very broad and pulley-shaped trochlea (toe joint). A small bony bump (a dorsomedial projection) is present just above the inside edge of this trochlea. A ridge extends between the metatarsals II and III in the lower part of each bone. The middle of metatarsal II preserved a large tubercule (a node for muscle attachment) while the near part of metatarsal III possesses a thin ridge. No metatarsal I or hallux is preserved in any of the specimens. As in most enantiornitheans, no hypotarsus (a wide ridge on the back of the tarsometatarsus) is present. Relationships Due to the peculiar autapomorphies present in this taxon's remains, its affinities are uncertain. It has sometimes been compared to avisaurids, a group of late Cretaceous enantiornitheans which are also primarily known from tarsometatarsals. A small phylogenetic analysis performed during its initial description in 1993 found several most parsimonious trees with conflicting results. Some placed it as a closer relative of avisaurids than Lectavis bretincola (an unusually long- legged enantiornithean discovered in the same deposit) was. However, other most parsimonious trees offered the opposite result, with Lectavis being a closer relative of avisaurids than Yungavolucris. Since 1993, additional analyses have broadened the gap between Yungavolucris and avisaurids. Other enantiornitheans, such as Enantiophoenix, Halimornis, and Concornis, have been found to be closer to Avisaurus than either Yungavolucris or Lectavis. A close relationship between the two El Brete taxa and Avisaurus seems highly unlikely. As only the tarsometatarsus is known from Yungavolucris, it might be the same species as one of the other El Brete enantiornitheans described based on forelimb bones. The size of Yungavolucris is hard to tell; the comparatively huge Enantiornis might be a match if Yungavolucris had short legs of normal width, but Enantiornis seems to be a fairly conventionally- built taxon. If Yungavolucris had both unusually short and wide legs, it might have been the size of the small species of Martinavis or maybe the slightly larger Elbretornis. However, these genera have tibiotarsus material tentatively referred to them, and while this material may not actually belong to Martinavis or Elbretornis, it does not match the shape of a tibiotarsus that would form a working ankle with the Yungavolucris tarsometatarsus.

He was previously a marketing photographer for ad firm, Gannett Transit, in the early 1990s. History Between the summers of 1999 and 2000, a series of murders of prostitutes in the Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods of BrooklynRashbaum, William K. (2000). \\"Man Arrested in Killings of Six Women\\". The New York Times. Retrieved August 7, 2007 led police to arrest a Brooklyn homeless man, one of roughly 30 known associates of prostitutes in the area detained for questioning, on suspicion of the murders. However, DNA testing definitively excluded the man as the killer. After he was cleared as a suspect, the man befriended the officers of the Brooklyn North Homicide Task Force who were working the Brooklyn Strangler case. He told them of another homeless man in the area, with whom he frequently used crack cocaine, who seemed fixated on sadomasochistic sex.Rashbaum, William K. (2000). \\"DNA Links Suspect to Six Slayings\\". The Print: Official Publication of the Southern California Association of Fingerprint Officers, November/December 2000, Vol. 16, No. 6, reprinted from The San Diego Union-Tribune. Retrieved August 7. 2007. The man was subsequently able to identify this suspect, Vincent Johnson, 5'3\\" (1.6 m) and 130 lb (59 kg).Rashbaum, William K. (2000). \\"Man Cleared by DNA Tests Led Police to Murder Suspect\\". The New York Times. Retrieved August 7, 2007. Johnson initially refused to provide a DNA sample to police, and denied knowing any of the women. However, one of the detectives had observed him spitting on the street, and Johnson's saliva was retrieved and given to the medical examiner for testing.Giuliani, Rudy. (2001). \\"State of the City Address\\". Archives of Rudolph W. Giuliani. Retrieved August 7, 2007. Johnson's DNA matched that which was found on four of the victims. Johnson later confessed to the murders of five women: Patricia Sullivan, Rhonda Tucker, Joanne Feliciano, Vivian Caraballo and Laura Nusser, all of whom had arrest records for prostitution and drug offenses, and were themselves addicts.Kershaw, Sarah. (2000). \\"Connected in Friendship, and in Shared Addictions\\". The New York Times. Retrieved August 7, 2007. He remained a suspect in the murder of Katrina Niles, although, as of 2006, he continues to deny involvement in her death. Police consider it likely he had sex with at least three of his victims. Johnson reportedly claimed he was acting out a hatred of his mother. Three of the victims -- Caraballo, Feliciano and Sullivan -- were killed on Thursdays, and Rhonda Tucker probably was as well, although her body was discovered on a Saturday. According to Johnson, this deliberate fixation came about due to his loathing of his mother's one day off from work, always a Thursday. Johnson admitted little, if any, feelings of guilt. Of Patricia Sullivan, he said, \\"I didn't see strangling her as doing something wrong at the time\\"; although after killing his first victim, Laura Nusser, he said he reported feeling \\"sorry\\" and wanting to apologize to her family. Each of the victims was strangled, apparently with whatever ligature was at hand: two with their own shoelaces, one with a drawstring from a pair of sweatpants, two with electrical wire and one with what was probably a discarded piece of cloth. Johnson bound their bodies with the ligatures, but did not attempt to hide them. The women were left where they were killed, two on rooftops and one in a vacant lot in roughly the same vicinity in Williamsburg, two in apartments in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and one in a utility room under the Williamsburg Bridge, where Johnson was known to have slept occasionally on a cot. Johnson is currently serving a life sentence without parole in Clinton Correctional Facility, in Dannemora, New York.

He served on North York's Board of Control from 1974 to 1976. Political career Markin was elected to the North York Board of Control in his first bid for public office, in the 1974 municipal election. He campaigned on a platform of campaign finance reform, calling for a $10,000 spending limit and a full disclosure of sources before an election. Markin indicated that his own expenses would be limited to $5,000.Bruce Kirkland, \\"\`No issue', lots of words in North York board race\\", Toronto Star, 21 November 1974, A8. He was twenty-seven years old.\\"North York Board of Control\\", Toronto Star, 28 November 1974, A19. Markin's election to the Board of Control gave him an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto council. He emerged as an opponent of downtown Toronto councillor John Sewell, and in 1975 advocated that Metro Council assume direct control of the city's downtown area.\\"City core concerns everyone in Metro\\" [editorial], Toronto Star, 22 April 1975, B4. He later brought forward a censure motion against Sewell for having said that Metro Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson deliberately misled council.Ross Howard, \\"Sewell to face censure motion for libel charge\\", Toronto Star, 25 September 1975, B1. Markin called for a reform of North York's election laws in 1975, to permit the senior controller to take over as mayor if the incumbent leaves office in mid-term.Michael Best, \\"A foe of Lastman's hopes to succeed him\\" [sic], Toronto Star, 2 July 1975, E1. He acknowledged to reporters that he held mayoral ambitions himself, but added that he would not seek the position as long as it was held by Mel Lastman, a personal friend.Michael Best, \\"A novice's view of civic government\\", Toronto Star, 3 January 1976, B7. Markin obtained some national notoriety in late 1976 for speaking out against the federal government's decision to adopt the metric system.\\"Stop metric madness before it's too late, reader warns\\", Toronto Star, 15 April 1976, B5; Carola Vyhnak, \\"Metric system is inching in\\", Toronto Star, 11 August 1976, E12. Markin's promising political career came to an unexpected end in late 1976. He attended only one North York council meeting in the second half of the year, and left the city in November to take rabbinical studies in New York.David Miller, \\"City issues 73 repair orders on Murray Markin's house\\", Toronto Star, 1 December 1976, A10. He did not seek re- election in the 1976 campaign. He later ran for a seat on the North York Hydro Commission in 1980, but was unsuccessful. His brother, Murray Markin, was a North York city councillor from 1976 to 1978. Legal career Markin oversaw several high-profile legal cases. In February 1989, he represented a disbarred Toronto lawyer in a $2.6 million lawsuit against provincial Attorney General Ian Scott. The lawyer in question had hired Scott as his representative in a disciplinary case six years earlier, and later accused Scott of negligence when the result led to his disbarment.Alfred Holden, \\"Greenspan takes stand in lawsuit against Scott\\", Toronto Star, 10 February 1989, A18. The suit received extensive media coverage before being dismissed by a jury.Thomas Claridge, \\"Negligence suit against Scott dismissed\\", Globe and Mail, 24 February 1989, A15. In 1995, Markin represented a teacher who claimed he was discriminated against by the Toronto Separate (ie. Roman Catholic) School Board, because he himself was not a Catholic.Donovan Vincent, \\"Teacher seeks right to pursue dispute\\", Toronto Star, 2 August 1995, A6. In 2001, he represented Toronto Transit Commission workers who argued that they were exposed to asbestos dust while rebuilding the Sheppard subway station.Jane Gadd, \\"Suit launched against TTC\\", Globe and Mail, 30 November 2001, A22. He represented Salim Damji in a major fraud case in 2002, and oversaw Damji's plea of guilty to the charges against him. Damji had stolen money from over eight hundred members from Canada's Ismaili community by selling shares for a bogus teeth-whitening invention. Markin appealed for a light sentence, arguing that Damji had been put up to the scheme by figures involved in organized crime.Nick Pron, \\"A smile that scammed millions\\", Toronto Star, 19 November 2002, B1.

Armstrong was born in 1664 in Ireland. According to a Pedigree of Armstrongs compiled by Edmund Clarence Richard Armstrong, Bluemantle Pursuivant, Keeper of Irish Antiquities, National Museum, Dublin, His parents were Charles Armstrong (1646-1731) and a Miss Gostwick, who are shown in Burke's Commoners as having no issue. Charles Armstrong's birthplace was Stonestown, Offaly, Ireland. Armstrong arrived in the New World in 1711 as a ship-wreck victim along with troops headed to take Quebec. He and a contingent of men were dispatched to strengthen Annapolis Royal, in Nova Scotia. The garrison was impoverished and Armstrong and his fellow captains had little choice but to use their own pay to support their companies, trying to improve their situation, until the appointment of Richard Philipps as governor and the establishment of the new Col. Philipp's Regiment of Foot in 1717. Armstrong's debts accumulated as the problems of supporting his company increased, and with his Boston creditors pressing him, he went to England in 1715 to seek redress. In February 1715/16 he presented his case to the Lords of Trade, who arranged to reimburse him for his losses. He spent four years in England, living on his pay and compensation. He returned to Nova Scotia in 1720 where circumstances had markedly improved. In 1725, he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Nova Scotia. His period as lieutenant- governor was marked by many difficulties and attempts to improve the lot of the colony. There was a mistrust and dislike between Armstrong and Governor Philipps, and ongoing problems with the governor's brother-in-law, Major Alexander Cosby, who had a great deal of influence in the colonies of Nova Scotia. Armstrong left Nova Scotia as soon as Philipps arrived in 1729, but was back in 1731 bearing a new commission, as colonel commanding the 40th Foot, with orders for Philipps’ recall, and an entitlement to Philipps’ pay. At age 75 and suffering from illness, on 6 December 1739 Lieutenant-governor Armstrong allegedly committed suicide at Annapolis Royal, N.S to end his stormy, and often frustrating, career.

It is an alkaloid chemically related to tryptamines. Derivatives of tryptoline have a variety of pharmacological properties and are known collectively as tryptolines. Pharmacology Many tryptolines are competitive selective inhibitors of the enzyme monoamine oxidase type A (MAO-A). 5-Hydroxytryptoline and 5-methoxytryptoline (pinoline) are the most active monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with IC50s of 0.5 μM and 1.5 μM respectively, using 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) as substrate. Tryptolines are also potent reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and epinephrine, with a significantly greater selectivity for serotonin. Comparison of the inhibition kinetics of tetrahydro-β-carbolines for serotonin and epinephrine reuptake to that of the platelet aggregation response to these amines has shown that 5-hydroxymethtryptoline, methtryptoline, and tryptoline are poor inhibitors of reuptake. In all respects 5-hydroxytryptoline and 5-methoxytryptoline showed greater pharmacological activity than the tryptoline and methtryptoline. Although the in vivo formation of tryptolines has been a matter of controversy, they have profound pharmacological activity.

The plot centres on the discovery of a long-lost painting from Pieter Bruegel's series The Months. The story is essentially a farce, but contains a large amount of scholarship about the painter. Frayn distinguishes between the iconology and iconography of the paintings and suggests that rather than simply being a series of pastoral images they symbolise a Dutch populace undergoing great suffering as a result of Spanish rule. The novel was shortlisted for the 1999 Booker Prize. Plot Martin, the main character, is supposed to be writing a book. He finds himself invited to dinner at the house of a repellent and warring couple, on whom the land and property they own seems entirely wasted. Martin happens on a painting which he takes to be by Brueghel. Painstaking research leads him (via a full scale reassessment of the interpretation of the five surviving pictures in Brueghel's The Months) to identify the picture as the missing sixth picture of Brueghel's famous book of hours. Meantime his wife, (an actual art historian whereas he is only peripherally connected with the scholarly art world), and their baby live in a cottage and he fears his wife eyes him with increasing disdain as, instead of working on his book, he pursues the Breughel data. Martin has to fake the promise of an affair with the woman of the house to get hold of the picture, and indulge in a series of implausible transactions in other pictures to keep his access to the Brueghel open. Once he gets it, his troubles have only begun. Finally, as he is about to succeed in taking it to a safe place and secure his fortune, he crashes the old Landrover and the picture goes up in smoke.

It is within the parish of St Levan and approximately south of Land's End, and less than north- west of Porthgwarra, the nearest village. The area of Gwennap Head is designated as part of the Penwith Heritage Coast and also designated as part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The South West Coast Path closely follows the coastline around the headland. Its intricate and varied granite cliffs include the famous Chair Ladder crag, making it a popular destination for recreational climbers of all abilities. The older and more correct name for the headland is Tol-Pedn-Penwith (locally \\"Tol-Pedn\\" for short) which comes from the Cornish for 'the holed headland of Penwith', referring to the awesome vertical blowhole from the clifftop to a sea cave. From 1888 the name was changed to Gwennap Head, perhaps named after a local family.Weatherhill C. (2007) Cornish Place Names and Language. Ammanford: Sigma Press. The inshore waters around the headland are busy with shipping of all sizes. There is a Coastwatch station on the headland in the former coastguard building. The area is also popular with naturalists who, at the appropriate time of the year, can see rare animals such as chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), great shearwater (Puffinus gravis), basking shark and ocean sunfish (Mola mola). History Tol Pedn was once known as Land's End, and in the early 19th century was usually called St Leven's Land's End in order to distinguish it from the present day Land's End, which was then called Sennen Land's End and Cape Cornwall which has also been known as Land's End. It would seem that, in the past Tol-pedn was considered to be a larger area, than what is today considered to be the headland of Gwennap Head. Hitchens (1824) writes that ″Tolpedn-Penwith is divided from the mainland by an ancient stone wall″, which he thought might have been for defence. A stone wall exists to this day to the north reaching the sea near Black Carn although it seems to be a boundary and/or stock wall rather than defensive. He also indicates that there was other evidence for ancient fortifications in the area. In the 1840s H McLauchlan reported seeing ″faint traces of a Bronze Age tumulus at the top″ of Tol-pedn-Penwith, although today there are no traces, and the highest point is now occupied by the NCI Coastwatch station. Reports of a cliff castle are considered doubtful, partly because there are no traces but also because the site is considered unsuitable. On the north side of Gwennap Head is a stream that flows into the boulder-strewn cove of Porth Loe. On 14 March 1905 the Kyber was observed from the Wolf Rock, on a bearing to pass The Lizard. The next morning the barque was seen coming ashore at Porth Loe and broke up within fifteen minutes. Men building the nearby coastguard houses used ladders to save three of the crew and a further twenty-three are buried in a mass grave in St Levan churchyard. The area is owned by the St Aubyn Estate. =NCI Coastwatch= National Coastwatch Institution station on Gwennap Head near Porthgwarra, Cornwall. There is evidence that the headland has been used as a base for watching ships for centuries. In the museum at Truro there is a photograph of a signal station which has been identified as being on Tol-pedn; the Union Flag dating it to pre-1801. Early maps also show a station here and a photograph shows a two-arm semaphore dating to circa 1900–10. The prominent building that can be seen today was begun in around 1905, as a one-storey Coastguard lookout station, and was opened by 1910. A second storey was added to give extra height to the watch room after a French trawler was wrecked at the foot of Wireless Point, Porthcurno on 14 March 1956. The Vert Prairial could not be seen when she was wrecked, and seventeen crew lost their lives. The coastguard station was closed in 1994, and re-opened on 21 October 1996 as NCI Gwennap Head. =Day marks= Runnelstone navigation markers on Gwennap Head There are a pair of cone-shaped navigation markers on Gwennap Head, in line with the Runnelstone buoy. These are day markers warning vessels of the hazard of the Runnel Stone. The cone to the seaward side is painted red and the inland one is black and white. When at sea the black and white one should always be kept in sight in order to avoid the submerged rocks nearer the shore. If the black and white cone is completely obscured by the red cone then the vessel would be directly on top of the Runnel Stone. The black and white landmark was erected by the Corporation of Trinity House in 1821 – an event recorded on a plaque on the back of the marker. Between 1880 and 1923 over thirty identified steamships were wrecked, stranded or sank in the area. There have been none since 1923. The navigation markers feature as \\"the Cones of Runnel\\" in Hammond Innes's 1940 thriller \\"The Trojan Horse\\". Wildlife and ecology Gwennap Head is part of the Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) designated for its vegetation of waved maritime heath, and for being of considerable ornithological interest; especially for passage migrants. It is renowned for its relative abundance of passing marine bird species with many common species such as northern gannet (Morus bassanus), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), common guillemot, (Uria aalge), razorbill (Alca torda), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). The headland is favoured by birdwatchers and many travel the length and breadth of Britain to track rare seabirds. In July and August there is a chance to see two large shearwater species outside of their breeding season. The great shearwater breeds in the south Atlantic on islands in the Tristan da Cunha group and the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) breeds in the Mediterranean, and on North Atlantic islands; mostly among the Azores. Many birds follow the coast as they migrate north in spring to breed or head south in the autumn to overwinter in warmer places. At Gwennap Head many waders, ducks, larks and finches are seen especially during the peak times in May and October. Breeding birds include the red-billed choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) which have recently been breeding successfully on Gwennap Head, but lost their young to a predator in early May 2015. From 2007 to 2011, the Seawatch SW survey was organised by Dr Russell Wynn with the aim of recording the numbers of targeted species from a designated location close to the cliff edge on Gwennap Head. The survey ran from 15 July to 15 October each year and most of the recording was by volunteers who spent up to twelve hours a day on seawatch. The main targeted species were Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) and basking shark, along with the ocean sunfish (or common mola). Marine mammals such as whales, dolphins and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) were additional main targets. During a seawatch on 28 August 2015 a red-billed tropicbird (Phaethon aethereus) was seen over the Runnel Stone, a bird that usually frequents tropical areas. Gwennap Head is part of the Land's End granite massif with shallow, free-draining and acidic soils. The dominant plants of the maritime heath are heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). Near the edges of the cliff there is maritime grassland and includes the red data species, perennial centaury (Centaurium scilloides), and early meadow-grass (Poa infirma), along with the rare hairy bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus subbiflorus) and yellow bartsia (Parentucellia viscosa). The grassland can be colourful in the spring and early summer with spring squill, thrift, sea campion and kidney vetch in flower followed by the purple and yellow of the maritime heath in mid and late summer. In 2010 perennial centaury, a national rarity, was refound by Helen and Laurie Oakes. Despite many searches by botanists the species had not been seen in Cornwall (and England) since 1962 (or possibly 1967), and survived on only one Welsh site; coastal footpaths of Pembrokeshire National Park, Wales. The re-discovery follows the re-introduction of cattle grazing under a HLS Stewardship agreement. Resident butterflies include large white (Pieris brassicae), small copper (Lycaena phlaeas), common blue (Polyommatus icarus), small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae), peacock (Aglais io), comma (Polygonia c-album), small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), grayling (Hipparchia semele) and wall (Lasiommata megera). As well as birds, some insects also migrate and butterflies often seen include clouded yellow (Colias croceus), red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui). Migrant moths include rush veneer (Nomophila noctuella), rusty-dot pearl (Udea ferrugalis), hummingbird hawk-moth (Macroglossum stellatarum) and silver Y (Autographa gamma). =Marine Conservation Zone= The Runnel Stone Marine Conservation Zone (also known as Land's End (Runnel Stone)) was designated on 29 January 2016, covers 20 km2 and is based on a 3.5 km arc measured from the NCI lookout. Included is much of the coast from Gwennap Head to Hall Dinas on the east side of Treryn Dinas. As well as protecting deep sea rocks on the Runnel Stone reef, the MCZ also protects other habitats ranging from exposed rock on the coast to soft sediments on the sea floor.

Incident process During a demonstration of a Tibetan sand painting ceremony, Draper leapt up on the service desk in the Fiction section brandishing a M1911 pistol and claiming to have a bomb. He ordered nearby people into a conference room, which was already occupied by a Toastmasters group: librarian Gwen Page, six civilians, and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Lt. Lloyd Prescott, who offered to change places with the last person who entered the conference room. Lt. Prescott was in plain clothes at the time and had his pistol hidden on his person. After Draper and the others entered the room Page began to count hostages, as ordered, and began to have them line up facing the wall while Draper made demands and described his plans. A Toastmaster managed to inconspicuously slip several hostages out a second door in the conference room, inciting a run for more hostages to exit the commons. Page and others chose to stay in the room while Draper threatened but did not shoot. =Staff response= The library staff acted quickly by calling 911 and evacuating the five-story building in under five minutes, by using the fire alarm. Several staff stayed on-site to provide police with floor plans and operating the telephone, security and power lines according to the wishes of the SWAT teams. One librarian, Jenny Wright, hid a group of eight children and their parents from the Children's Section (located on the second floor near Draper) in another conference room until Draper was satisfied with the number of hostages and had closed the door and had lowered blinds over the room's glass walls. Another librarian arrived and the group was led to safety through an exit in the staff area of the building.Salt Lake City PL Press Release =Bomb= Draper placed what he claimed was a bomb on the table in the center of the conference room. It was equipped with a dead man's switch which would cause it to detonate if Draper released a hand-held button. For this reason Lt. Prescott hesitated to use force, and the incident lasted more than six hours, during which Draper made demands for cash, gold and platinum bullion, back-pay for prior military service, and a full presidential pardon from President Bill Clinton.Hostage Taking and Explosives in Salt Lake At one point, Draper had one of the hostages put more duct tape on the homemade bomb because he feared the two contact points for the detonator would spontaneously close. After this, he announced that everyone would draw straws to determine the order in which they would be shot until his demands were met. Lt. Prescott decided to risk the chance that the thick oak table the bomb was situated on would be able to shield the hostages if they could get under it in time. Just as Draper was seen crouching with another hostage to check the bomb detonator, Lt. Prescott seized his chance. He withdrew his pistol and, while shouting at the other hostages to get on the floor, fired five times at Draper while SWAT members crashed through the glass walls of the conference room. Draper was hit by all five bullets and fell to the floor wounded. Despite the dead man's switch, the bomb did not detonate. Draper was rushed to nearby LDS Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The bomb turned out to be real and was determined to be modeled after a Vietnam War-era anti-personnel claymore mine that would have been particularly deadly if it had gone off. The Salt Lake City Police Department's bomb squad deemed it too volatile to move, and it was detonated inside the conference room. None of the shrapnel penetrated the table, verifying Lt. Prescott's hypothesis. Legacy The incident was dramatized in a 1994 episode of Rescue 911 and in a 2017 episode of the ABC series In an Instant.

Oberst (July 23, 1901 – May 30, 1991) was an American football player, track and field athlete, coach of football and basketball, and college athletics administrator. A native of Owensboro, Kentucky, he played football at the University of Notre Dame in the 1920s under coach Knute Rockne, and competed in track and field as a javelin thrower. He won the Olympic bronze medal at the 1924 Summer Games in Paris. Oberst served as the head football coach at Washington and Lee University (1929–1930), Canisius College (1931–1932), and John Carroll University (1946). Football career Oberst, who was listed at 6' 5\\" (1.96 m) and 203 lbs (92 kg), was a right tackle for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in 1920, 1922, and 1923, wearing uniform No. 30.http://und.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08fbrecordssupplement He was one of Notre Dame's \\"Seven Mules,\\" the offensive linemen who blocked for the team's legendary Four Horsemen in the 1920s. Oberst's teammates also included halfback George Gipp. Javelin throw As the possibly apocryphal story goes, Oberst was walking by a Notre Dame track and field practice one day when a javelin landed nearby. He picked it up and threw it far beyond the original thrower. Rockne, who coached track and field as well as football, saw the toss, and drafted Oberst on the spot.http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2008/08/tim_warsinskeys_take_how_does.html Oberst was the 1921 NCAA javelin champion, with a throw of 191' 2\\" (58.27 m). At the 1924 Penn Relays, Oberst's throw of 196' 2 5/8\\" (59.80 m) beat the meet record by more than 8 feet. Oberst had a disappointing performance at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Cambridge, Massachusetts, finishing in 5th place with a throw of 180' 3\\" (54.94 m). The U.S. Olympic Committee added Oberst to the Olympic team, anyway, because of his better results at previous meets. The Olympic Trials winner, William Neufeld of UC Berkeley went on to finish 5th at the Olympics. In Paris, Oberst's throw of 58.35 m won him the bronze medal, behind the defending Olympic champion, Jonni Myyrä of Finland (62.96 m) and Gunnar Lindström of Sweden (60.92 m). Oberst was the first American to win an Olympic medal in the javelin throw, and only seven Americans have medaled since, most notably Babe Didrikson at the 1932 Olympics in Los Angeles. Oberst's Notre Dame football teammate Tom Lieb also made the 1924 U.S. Olympic team, in the discus throw, and won the bronze medal. Coaching career After college, Oberst became a coach, teacher, and athletics administrator. In 1926 and 1927, his football teams at Roman Catholic High School won the championships of the Philadelphia Catholic League,http://www.tedsilary.com/CLFBchamps.htm with a combined record of 15–3–1. From 1929 to 1930, Oberst coached the Washington and Lee University Generals, compiling a 6–11–2 record. In 1931 and 1932, Oberst coached at Canisius College, where his record was 2–7–3. Oberst later moved on to John Carroll College, now John Carroll University, where he finished his career. He was a football line coach for the Blue Streaks from 1936 to 1942. Oberst then served as director of the school's V-12 Navy training program from 1942 to 1946. He was head basketball coach during the 1945–46 season, with a 4–11 record,http://www.jcusports.com/custompages/mbball/seasons/1945_1946.htm and head football coach in 1946, with a 1–7 record.http://www.jcusports.com/sports/2008/9/9/FB_1946.aspx Oberst also coached the school's track and field team from 1947 to 1948.

R. Kazallon, Passenger () is an 1875 novel written by Jules Verne about the final voyage of a British sailing ship, the Chancellor, told from the perspective of one of its passengers (in the form of a diary). Plot summary Characters At the beginning of its voyage, the Chancellor carried eight passengers and twenty crew members. By the end, only eleven people (five passengers and six crew) remained alive. =Passengers= * J.R. Kazallon, the narrator and one of the survivors. * Mr. Kear, an American from Buffalo, is a wealthy and conceited man of about 50 years of age whose fortunes lie in the petroleum industry. Leaving behind his feverish wife, he escapes the Chancellor in a whaleboat on the night of December 5 and is not seen again (his death, given the storminess of the ocean the next morning, is implied). * Mrs. Kear * Miss Herbey, one of the survivors. * M. Letourneur, one of the survivors. * Andre Letourneur, one of the survivors. * William Falsten, a 45-year-old English engineer from Manchester who passes much of his time aboard the Chancellor engrossed in mechanical calculations. He is one of the eleven survivors. * John Ruby, a Welsh merchant originally of Cardiff whose sole goal in life seems to be the pursuit of profit. He loses his sanity after learning of the fire burning in the ship's hold and realizing that it could detonate the thirty pounds of potassium picrate he had brought on board the ship. He dies on October 29, burned to death after jumping into the burning cargo hold. =Crew= * John Silas Huntly, an approximately 50-year-old Scotsman of Dundee, is the captain of the Chancellor until he resigns his post to his first mate on October 23. He escapes the Chancellor in a whaleboat on the night of December 5 and is not seen again (his death, given the storminess of the ocean the next morning, is implied). * Robert Curtis, the first mate on the Chancellor. John Silas Huntly passes over his post as captain to him on October 23 and he acts as a leader of sorts throughout the story. He survives the events. * Lt. Walter * The boatswain * Hobart was the steward on the ship. Kazallon describes him as being in the best health during the raft trip, and it is eventually revealed that he was hoarding bacon. On this day, January 18, he commits suicide and several sailors cannibalize his remains. Kazallon, Miss Herbey, M. Letourneur, and Andre do not partake and it is unknown if Curtis does. His remains are thrown overboard on January 19, presumably by Andre. * Jynxstrop Timeline The crew and passengers of the Chancellor are at sea for four months, from September 27, 1869 to January 27, 1870. Note: This timeline omits any events for which the date cannot be precisely determined. =Onboard the Chancellor (September 27 - December 7, 1869)= * September 27: At three o'clock in the afternoon, the Chancellor departs Charleston, South Carolina with eight passengers, 20 crew, and 1,700 bales of cotton. * October 7: The Chancellor arrives at latitude 32°20' N and longitude 64°50' W, not far off the coast of Bermuda. * October 11: The Chancellor enters the Sargasso Sea. * October 14: In early morning, the crew discovers a fire in the cargo hold; the passengers remain unaware. The Chancellor arrives at latitude 21° 33' N and longitude 50° 17' W. * October 21: J.R. Kazallon, William Falsten, and Robert Curtis (the first mate) learn that John Ruby had smuggled thirty pounds of potassium picrate into the ship's hold. All passengers become aware of the fire burning inside the ship after Ruby's outburst of Fire on board! Fire! Fire!. * October 23: Captain John Silas Huntly resigns his post; Curtis, the first mate, becomes captain. * October 29: Flames from the fire shoot through the deck. Shortly before midnight, the Chancellor runs aground on a reef. ** John Ruby dies after plunging into the burning hold through an open hatchway. * October 30: The ocean waves flood the ship's hold and begin to extinguish the fire; repairs on the ship commence. * October 31: Andre Letourneur proposes to name the newly discovered reef Ham Rock. * November 6: The fire in the Chancellor's cargo hold is extinguished. * November 8: In a combined effort, the crew and passengers commence unloading the cotton into the ocean. * November 20: Repairs to the Chancellor are completed. * November 24: The Chancellor departs Ham Rock. * November 30: At about two o'clock in the morning, a sailor discovers two feet of water in the hold. The water rises to three feet by daybreak. * December 1: The water inside the hold is at five feet. * December 3: The water inside the hold is at six feet. * December 4: Curtis, the captain, decides to abandon ship. Construction on a raft commences. The Chancellor stops sinking with the deck now two feet underwater. Near eleven o'clock at night, the ropes holding the uncompleted raft snap and it goes adrift. * December 5: The Chancellor is now approximately at latitude 16° N. The hull is three-fourths submerged. *December 6: Near eight o'clock in the morning, the boatswain discovers that the whaleboat is missing, along with Mr. Kear, John Silas Huntly, and three sailors. They escaped late the previous evening and their exact fate remains unknown (they are presumed to perish in the stormy waters). ** At five o'clock, Mrs. Kear dies after experiencing (over the past three days) drowsiness, exhaustion, and fever. * December 7: The construction of the second raft is completed. After eight o'clock in the morning, the Chancellor sinks after more than 70 days at sea. ** At seven o'clock in the morning, two sailors and an apprentice drown after jumping overboard as the newly completed raft begins drifting away from the foundering ship.''' =Onboard the raft (December 7, 1869 - January 27, 1870)= *December 7: The position of the raft is calculated as about latitude 15° 07' N and longitude 49° 35' W, approximately 650 miles northeast of Paramaribo in Dutch Guiana. *December 17: Sharks begin following the drifting raft. *December 22: A powerful storm ravages the occupants of the raft washing overboard two sailors as well as all of their meat and fish provisions. **At around three o'clock in the morning, two sailors (Austin and O'Ready) are washed overboard and perish in the storm. *January 1: The last of the food provisions brought on board the raft from the Chancellor are exhausted. *January 5: At six o'clock in the morning, a struggle takes place between six drunken crewmen led by Owen and Curtis, the boatswain, Dowlas, and some of the passengers. One of the mutineering sailors, Wilson, dies after being struck in the chest by a hatchet wielded by Curtis, and the mutiny is suppressed. *January 7: At about half-past seven in the evening, Lt. Walter dies of tuberculosis (\\"consumption\\"). *January 8: Before daylight, Curtis and Kazallon throw the body of Lt. Walter overboard, but not before discovering the right foot missing. Kazallon discovers later that night that the boatswain had cut off the foot for bait. *January 10: Owen falls ill from copper oxide poisoning after secretly drinking from the previously untouched barrel of fresh water. *January 11: Owen dies from copper oxide poisoning and his body is thrown overboard. *January 13 or 14: At about eleven o'clock, Curtis and the boatswain sight a ship twelve miles from the raft. However, after the passage of several hours and despite the efforts of the raft's occupants (starting a fire aboard the raft), the ship disappears across the horizon. *January 18: Hobart commits suicide by hanging sometime before dawn after Kazallon snatched away and ate a piece of bacon the steward had been (secretly) hiding away. To assuage their hunger, the sailors and Falsten proceed to cannibalize the body (Mr. Kazallon, Miss Herbey, Andre, and M. Letorneur do not join in; whether Curtis does is unknown). *January 19 or 20: The uneaten remains of Hobart are thrown overboard (presumably by Andre) during the night. *January 22: In a fit of madness, Jynxstrop jumps off the raft and is eaten by the circling sharks. *January 26: A ten o'clock in the morning, Dowlas proposes that lots be drawn to determine who will be eaten by the rest. In the ensuing commotion Mr. Kazallon falls overboard and discovers that the water is fresh. The raft has entered the mouth of Amazon River.

Footnotes # In Chapter XXX, Jules Verne writes that the Chancellor had been at sea 72 days before sinking. However, the actual length of its voyage is less than 71 days (it sailed only nine hours on September 27 and was afloat only eight hours on December 7). The precise length of the voyage is either 70 days, 17 hours (if the ship sank at 08:00 Charleston time) or 70 days, 15 hours (if the ship sank at 08:00 local time in the UTC-3 time zone, which would be 06:00 in Charleston, which is located in the UTC-5 time zone).

Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg famously published it in 1918 as organ of the Spartacus League. Following the deaths of Liebknecht and Luxemburg during the chancellorship of the Social Democratic Party of Germany's Friedrich Ebert, the newspaper was published, with interruptions, by the Communist Party of Germany.

In 1926, the newspaper moved into the Karl Liebknecht House, to which it added in July 1928 a rotary press. On 23 February 1933, Nazi police occupied Karl-Liebknecht-Haus and closed it the following day, anticipating the Nazi ban on all communist and socialist press after the Reichstag fire a few days later (28 February 1933).

In addition to the German Communist Party (DKP), which is widely known as the West German KPD successor party and publishes the newspaper Unser Zeit as a party organ , various competing small communist parties , the so-called K groups , were founded, each of which was associated with different ideological concepts of communism (from Maoism to Stalinism to Trotskyism ). Out of these groupings, there were several newspaper projects in the 1970s called Rote Fahne. The Communist Party of Germany (KPD), a fringe party founded in 1990 by disgruntled members of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, publishes its own version of Die Rote Fahne.

The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods. It includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and beans, and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats. In addition to its effect on blood pressure, it is designed to be a well-balanced approach to eating for the general public. DASH is recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a healthy eating plan.The USDA recommends the USDA Food Patterns including their vegetarian and vegan adaptations, the Mediterranean, and the DASH Eating Plan, in The DASH diet is one of three healthy diets recommended in the 2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines, which also include the Mediterranean diet or a vegetarian diet. The AHA considers the DASH diet \\"specific and well-documented across age, sex and ethnically diverse groups.\\" The DASH diet is based on NIH studies that examined three dietary plans and their results. None of the plans were vegetarian, but the DASH plan incorporated more fruits and vegetables, low fat or nonfat dairy, beans, and nuts than the others studied. The DASH diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 6 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 3 mm Hg in patients with high normal blood pressure (formerly called \\"pre-hypertension\\"). Those with hypertension dropped by 11 and 6 mm Hg, respectively. These changes in blood pressure occurred with no changes in body weight. The DASH dietary pattern is adjusted based on daily caloric intake ranging from 1,600 to 3,100 dietary calories.\\"> Although this diet is associated with a reduction of blood pressure and improvement of gout, there are uncertainties around whether its recommendation of low-fat dairy products is beneficial or detrimental. The diet is also advised to diabetic or obese individuals. The DASH diet was further tested and developed in the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart diet). \\"The DASH and DASH-sodium trials demonstrated that a carbohydrate-rich diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and that is reduced in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol substantially lowered blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. OmniHeart demonstrated that partial replacement of carbohydrate with either protein (about half from plant sources) or with unsaturated fat (mostly monounsaturated fat) can further reduce blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and coronary heart disease risk.\\" In January 2018, DASH was named the number 1 for \\"Best Diets Overall\\" for the eighth year in a row, and also as \\"For Healthy Eating\\", and \\"Best Heart-Healthy Diet\\"; and tied number 2 \\"For Diabetes\\"(out of 40 diets tested) in the U.S. News & World Report's annual “Best Diets” rankings. The DASH diet is similar to the Mediterranean diet and the AHA diet.  Description  The DASH diet is mainly based on fruits, vegetables, low-fat or fat free dairy, whole grains, fish, poultry, legumes, and nuts. It recommends reducing sodium intake, sweets (in drinks and foods) and red meat. It limits saturated and trans saturated fat, while increasing the intake of potassium, magnesium, protein, fiber and nutrients thought to help control blood pressure. The NHLBI provides sample plans with specific number of servings based on 1600, 2000 or 2600 calories per day. Here is the sample plan for 2000 calories daily: * 6-8 servings of grains or grain products (preferable whole-grain) * 4-5 servings of fruits * 4-5 servings of vegetables * 2-3 servings of low-fat dairy foods * 2-3 servings of fats and oils * 2 or fewer servings of meat, poultry or fish With the following weekly limitations: * 4-5 servings of nuts, seeds or dry beans * sweets and food with added sugars limited to a maximum of 5 Following this diet requires some planning ahead and cooking. To ease this, both the NHLBI and NIH maintain lists of healthy recipes. There is some conflicting data about the need for low-fat dairy foods, with some studies showing beneficial while others detrimental effects. Elements can be replaced by alternatives for those with allergies or lactose-intolerance, such as lactose-free products instead of dairy, and seeds instead of nuts. There is some evidence that replacing animal proteins by plant-based proteins, such as nuts and seeds, reduces mortality risks. Some people may at first experience gas and bloating due to the high fiber content of plant foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. This can be partially alleviated by limiting high fiber foods intake to 1 or 2 per week initially and progressively increasing. This may also be alleviated by substituting protein with carbohydrate. DASH in addition with a reduction of sodium intake is associated with a reduction of blood pressure, in both individuals with and without hypertension.  History and design  = Background = Currently, hypertension is thought to affect roughly 50 million people in the U.S. and approximately 1 billion worldwide. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), citing data from 2002, “The relationship between BP and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors. The higher the BP, the greater is the chance of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease. For individuals 40–70 years of age, each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP (SBP) or 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP (DBP) doubles the risk of CVD across the entire BP range from 115/75 to 185/115 mm Hg.”. The prevalence of hypertension led the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to propose funding to further research the role of dietary patterns on blood pressure. In 1992 the NHLBI worked with five of the most well-respected medical research centers in different cities across the U.S. to conduct the largest and most detailed research study to date. The DASH study used a rigorous design called a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and it involved teams of physicians, nurses, nutritionists, statisticians, and research coordinators working in a cooperative venture in which participants were selected and studied in each of these five research facilities. The chosen facilities and locales for this multi-center study were: (1) Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, (2) Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, (3) Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, (4) Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, and (5) Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Two DASH trials were designed and carried out as multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding studies with the purpose of testing the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. The standardized multi-center protocol is an approach used in many large-scale multi-center studies funded by the NHLBI. A unique feature of the DASH diet was that the foods and menu were chosen based on conventionally consumed food items so it could be more easily adopted by the general public if results were positive. The initial DASH study was begun in August 1993 and ended in July 1997. Contemporary epidemiological research had concluded that dietary patterns with high intakes of certain minerals and fiber were associated with low blood pressures. The nutritional conceptualization of the DASH meal plans was based in part on this research. = Diet = Two experimental diets were selected for the DASH study and compared with each other, and with a third: the control diet. The control diet was low in potassium, calcium, magnesium and fiber and featured a fat and protein profile so that the pattern was consistent with a “typical American diet at the time”. The first experimental diet was higher in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet (a “fruits and vegetables diet” ), with the exception of fewer snacks and sweets. Magnesium and Potassium levels were close to the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption in the fruits-and-vegetables diet, which also featured a high fiber profile. The second experimental diet was high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this diet has been called “the DASH Diet”. The DASH diet (or combination diet) was rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption. The combination or “DASH” diet was also high in whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts while being lower in red meat content, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages. The DASH diet was designed to provide liberal amounts of key nutrients thought to play a part in lowering blood pressure, based on past epidemiologic studies. One of the unique features of the DASH study was that dietary patterns rather than single nutrients were being tested. The DASH diet also features a high quotient of anti-oxidant rich foods thought by some to retard or prevent chronic health problems including cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Researchers have also found that the DASH diet is more effective than a low oxalate diet in the prevention and treatment of kidney stones, specifically calcium oxalate kidney stones (the most common type). = Study design = Participants ate one of the three aforementioned dietary patterns in 3 separate phases of the trial, including (1) Screening, (2), Run-in and (3) Intervention. In the screening phase, participants were screened for eligibility based on the combined results of blood pressure readings. In the 3 week run-in phase, each subject was given the control diet for 3 weeks, had their blood pressure measurements taken on each of five separate days, gave one 24-hour urine sample and completed a questionnaire on symptoms. At this point, subjects who were compliant with the feeding program during the screening phase were each randomly assigned to one of the three diets outlined above, to begin at the start of the 4th week. The intervention phase followed next; this was an 8-week period in which the subjects were provided the diet to which they had been randomly assigned. Blood pressures and urine samples were collected again during this time together with symptom & physical activity recall questionnaires. The first group of study subjects began the run-in phase of the trial in September 1994 while the fifth and final group began in January 1996. Each of the three diets contained the same 3 grams (3,000 mg) of sodium, selected because that was the approximate average intake in the nation at the time. Participants were also given two packets of salt, each containing 200 mg of sodium, for discretionary use. Alcohol was limited to no more than two beverages per day, and caffeine intake was limited to no more than three caffeinated beverages.  Study results  The DASH trial showed that dietary patterns can and do affect blood pressure in the high normal BP to moderately hypertensive adult population (systolic < 180 mm Hg & diastolic of 80 to 95 mm Hg). Respectively, the DASH or “combination” diet lowered blood pressures by an average of 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic, compared with the control diet. The minority portion of the study sample and the hypertensive portion both showed the largest reductions in blood pressure from the combination diet against the control diet. The hypertensive subjects experienced a drop of 11.4 mm Hg in their systolic and 5.5 mm Hg in their diastolic phases. The fruits-and-vegetables diet was also successful, although it produced more modest reductions compared with the control diet (2.8 mm Hg systolic and 1.1 mm Hg diastolic). In the subjects with and without hypertension, the combination diet effectively reduced blood pressure more than the fruits-and-vegetables diet or the control diet did. The data indicated that reductions in blood pressure occurred within two weeks of subjects’ starting their designated diets, and that the results were generalizable to the target sample of the U.S. population. Side effects were negligible, but the NEJM study reports that some subjects reported constipation as a problem. At the end of the intervention phase, 10.1, 5.4 & 4.0 percent of the subjects reported this problem for the control, fruits-and- vegetables and combination diets, respectively, showing that the fruits and vegetables and combination diets reduce constipation. Apart from only one subject (on the control diet) who was suffering from cholecystitis, other gastrointestinal symptoms had a low rate of incidence.  DASH-Sodium study  = Design = The DASH-Sodium study was conducted following the end of the original DASH study to determine whether the DASH diet could produce even better results if it were low in salt and also to examine the effects of different levels of sodium in people eating the DASH diet. The researchers were interested in determining the effects of sodium reduction when combined with the DASH diet as well as the effects of the DASH diet when at three levels of sodium intake. The DASH-Sodium trial was conducted from September 1997 through November 1999. Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food. The participants were adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (average systolic of 120 to 159 mm Hg & average diastolic of 80 to 95 mm Hg) and were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups. The two randomized diet groups were the DASH diet and a control diet that mirrored a “typical American diet”, and which was somewhat low in key nutrients such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. The DASH diet was the same as in the previous DASH study. After being assigned to one of these two diets, the participants were given diets that differed by 3 distinct levels of sodium content, corresponding to 3,000 mg, 2,400 mg or 1,500 mg/day (higher, intermediate or lower), in random order, for 30 consecutive days each. During the two-week run-in phase, all participants ate the high sodium control diet. The 30-day intervention phase followed, in which subjects ate their assigned diets at each of the aforementioned sodium levels (high, intermediate and low) in random order, in a crossover design. During the 30-day dietary intervention phase, each participant therefore consumed his or her assigned diet (either DASH or control) at all three sodium levels. = Results and conclusions = The primary outcome of the DASH-Sodium study was systolic blood pressure at the end of the 30-day dietary intervention periods. The secondary outcome was diastolic blood pressure. The DASH-Sodium study found that reductions in sodium intake produced significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the control and DASH diets. Study results indicate that the quantity of dietary sodium in the control diet was twice as powerful in its effect on blood pressure as it was in the DASH diet. Importantly, the control diet sodium reductions from intermediate to low correlated with greater changes in systolic blood pressure than those same changes from high to intermediate (change equal to roughly 40 mmol per day, or 1 gram of sodium). As stated by Sacks, F. et al., reductions in sodium intake by this amount per day correlated with greater decreases in blood pressure when the starting sodium intake level was already at the U.S. recommended dietary allowance, than when the starting level was higher (higher levels are the actual average in the U.S.). These results led researchers to postulate that the adoption of a national lower daily allowance for sodium than the currently held 2,400 mg could be based on the sound scientific results provided by this study. The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating a diet of 2300 mg of sodium a day or lower, with a recommendation of 1500 mg/day in adults who have elevated blood pressure; the 1500 mg/day is the low sodium level tested in the DASH-Sodium study. The DASH diet and the control diet at the lower salt levels were both successful in lowering blood pressure, but the largest reductions in blood pressure were obtained by eating a combination of these two (i.e., a lower-salt version of the DASH diet). The effect of this combination at a sodium level of 1,500 mg/day was an average blood pressure reduction of 8.9/4.5 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). The hypertensive subjects experienced an average reduction of 11.5/5.7 mm Hg. The DASH-sodium results indicate that low sodium levels correlated with the largest reductions in blood pressure for participants at both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive levels, with the hypertensive participants showing the greatest reductions in blood pressure overall.

The son of a Professor of Military Science at Purdue University, Dolan served in the Korean War before holding U.S. Army posts ranging from 'Instructor in Nuclear Weapons Employment' to 'Nuclear Effects Project Officer'. He later worked for both Lockheed Corporation and SRI International. He is best known as co-author with Samuel Glasstone of the well-known reference work The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, as well as first editor of the two-part edition of the U.S. Department of Defense’s 1,651 pages 'Secret-Restricted Data' manual, Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons (DNA-EM-1, 1 July 1972). Controversial publication Dolan also compiled the famous and controversial U.S. Army Field Manual, Nuclear Weapons Employment, FM 101-31, in 1963. Professor Freeman Dyson commented on it in his 1984 book, Weapons and Hope: The military doctrines summarised in FM 101-31 were valid... when tactical nuclear wars might have been small-scale and truly limited. The handbook represents a sincere attempt to put Oppenheimer’s philosophy of local nuclear defence into practice. Dr J. Robert Oppenheimer said of this nuclear weapons capabilities question: I am not qualified, and if I were qualified I would not be allowed, to give a detailed evaluation of the appropriateness of the use of atomic weapons against any or all such (military) targets; but one thing is very clear. It is clear that they can be used only as adjuncts in a military campaign which has some other components, and whose purpose is a military victory. They are not primarily weapons of totality or terror, but weapons used to give combat forces help they would otherwise lack. They are an integral part of military operations. Only when the atomic bomb is recognized as useful insofar as it is an integral part of military operations, will it really be of much help in the fighting of a war, rather than in warning all mankind to avert it. (Quotation: Samuel Cohen, Shame, 2nd ed., 2005, page 99.) Cold War deterrence and flexible nuclear capabilities A detailed study of the collateral damage problems by Dolan and others resulted in the concept of the U.S. ‘Triad’ of nuclear silos, bombers and submarine missile platforms for ‘cross-targeting’ (using different delivery platforms; aircraft, submarines and missiles) and ‘layering’ (using repeated hits by accurate low yield weapons). These tactics limit the risk of failure, and also reduce individual bomb yields, thus preventing any serious collateral damage to nearby civilian areas (heavy fallout, blast, or fires). Dolan revealed in the Capabilities of Nuclear Weapons, 1972 (c. 14: p. 1, declassified on 13 February 1989): One of the primary uses of nuclear weapons would be for the destruction of military field equipment. Other major targets discussed are missiles, ships, and submarines, but the longest chapter dealt with radiation dose prediction for human beings from the perspective of avoiding collateral damage, Chapter 10 Personnel Casualties is one of the shortest in the manual, containing only 38 out of the 1,651 pages). . Unclassified publications Philip J. Dolan contributed substantial discussions to two openly published books during the 1980s: *Characteristics of the Nuclear Radiation Environment Produced by Several Types of Disasters, Summary Volume, published as Appendix A to the April 27–29, 1981 National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Symposium on the Control of Exposure of the Public to Ionizing Radiation in the Event of Accident or Attack *Jack C. Greene & Daniel J. Strom (Editors), Would the Insects Inherit the Earth and Other Subjects of Concern to Those Who Worry About Nuclear War, Pergamon Press, London, 1988, 78pp The strange title of this second book refers to the discovery that cockroaches will withstand 67,500 rem (American variety) or 90,000-105,000 rem (German variety), compared to a human lethal exposure of only about 800 rem . One theory which resulted from these observations on insects was that cockroaches, along with some simple plants and bacteria, would be likely to be the only lifeforms to survive a severe nuclear war. This theory was refuted by experience of the very rapid recovery on isolated islands exposed to close-in heavy fallout and other effects from massive hydrogen bombs at the Bikini Atoll and Eniwetok Atoll, as well as from smaller nuclear weapons in the Nevada Test Site and Australia (Montebello Islands, Maralinga and Emu Field). Full ecological recovery surveys were documented before and after each test series. (For a brief online introduction into some these studies - with specific reference to the ecological effects of the 1.69 megatons Operation Castle Nectar shot, detonated in 1954 on a barge above the crater of the 10.4 megatons Ivy Mike thermonuclear test in Eniwetok Atoll - see and .)

The number of nihonjin gakkō increased to 80 in 1986 with the opening of Japanese schools in Barcelona and Melbourne. As of May of that year 968 teachers originating in Japan were teaching at these Japanese schools worldwide. That month 15,811 students were enrolled in those schools.\\"Section 4.

The number of nihonjin gakkō increased to 82 by 1987. Japanische Internationale Schule in Düsseldorf In the early 1980s, 40% of Japanese national children living in Europe attended nihonjin gakkō, while almost 95% of Japanese national children living abroad in Asia attended nihonjin gakkō. Many Japanese parents abroad sent their children to Japan to attend high school after they completed the junior high school abroad, or leaving the children behind, so they could become accustomed to the difficult Japanese university entrance systems. Toshio Iwasaki, the editor of the Journal of Japanese Trade & Industry, stated that this reason inhibited the development of Japanese senior high schools in other countries. The first overseas international schools that served the senior high school level were the Rikkyo School in England, gaining senior high school level classes after 1975,\\"INFORMATION IN ENGLISH.\\" (Archive) Rikkyo School in England.

While Japan was experiencing a major recession called the Lost Decade in the 1990s, so were nihonjin gakkō. Many of them were closed due to a dramatic decrease in enrollment. With its rapidly growing economy, China is an exception. Schools in Beijing, Shanghai and have been expanding and new schools had founded in Dalian, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Suzhou since 1991. By 2004 there were 83 Japanese day schools in 50 countries. Characteristics Japanese School in London Nihonjin gakkō use Japanese as their language of instruction. The curriculum is approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) so that students may easily adjust upon returning to Japan. For foreign language classes, each school usually teaches English and, if different, a major local language of the country.

START: p. 99. CITED: p. 103. Since the early 1990s, more parents have chosen a local school or an international school over nihonjin gakkō. Reasons include: * The parents prefer for their children to receive education in English; *Nihonjin gakkō have only elementary and middle schools, grades first through ninth, which are mandatory in Japan. Some schools offer a kindergarten program as well as a high school program, but they are uncommon. Children educated in an English- speaking environment will be able to continue their education where they live with their parents. Those who choose not to participate in the local education system will need to pass an entrance exam to enroll in a boarding school in Japan or one of the seven (as of October 2006) Shiritsu zaigai kyōiku shisetsu (私立在外教育施設), Japanese boarding schools worldwide. * The parents' desire to acculturate their children; * Many private and public Japanese schools have become flexible and accept expatriate students via a separate admissions system, or by offering exams in English. Locations Hong Kong Japanese School Nihonjin gakkō tend to be in the following types of areas in the world: * Those with a large Japanese temporary resident population, such as London or New York City. * Those where English is not the official language, such as Düsseldorf, São Paulo, Mexico City, Lima, Dubai, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur.

The character was created by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik and first appeared in Adventure into Fear #17. A pastiche of Superman, Wundarr was created based on Gerber's \\"love of the Superman character and (...) desire to do a little parody/homage.\\"Steve Gerber Interview, in The Krypton Companion, edited by Michael Eury; published by TwoMorrows Publishing, 2006 Publication history Wundarr first appeared in Adventure into Fear #17 (October 1973), written by Steve Gerber. Before long he became a frequent supporting character in Marvel Two-in-One. After Gerber's run on Marvel-Two-in-One, Wundarr mostly disappeared until the Project Pegasus saga (written by Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio), in which he became \\"The Aquarian.\\" =Relaunch candidate= In 2005, Marvel.com presented four characters to be relaunched. The Aquarian was one of these choices and took second place to Death's Head. Steve Gerber asked his fans on the Howard the Duck Yahoo! Group to vote against a revival of the character, since he would have neither creative control nor receive financial compensation from such a relaunch. =Legal issues= When Wundarr's first appearance was published, DC Comics claimed that Gerber had committed plagiarism (comics scholar Reed Tucker noted that \\"the line between homage and simply borrowing everything about Superman to meet (a) deadline (had been) blurred\\", to the extent that Wundarr even wore a blue-and-red unitard).Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC, by Reed Tucker, published October 3, 2017, by Da Capo Press Roy Thomas (Gerber's editor at the time) said that he had told Gerber prior to publication that the character would need to be changed, but that Gerber had not complied — and that as a result, Stan Lee considered firing Gerber. Ultimately, DC agreed to let Marvel continue using the character if sufficient changes were made to distinguish him from Superman (which, Gerber said in 2006, he had planned to do anyway).  Fictional character biography  =Early years= On a distant planet called Dakkam (whose name has been described as \\"ridiculously similar\\" to 'Daxam'Metropolis Marvels: 18 Marvel Characters That Are Just Superman Rip-Offs, by Octavio Karbank, at Comic Book Resources; published May 16, 2018; retrieved November 18, 2018), a scientist named Hektu (based on Jor-El) believes that his world will be destroyed when their sun goes nova. He and his wife, Soja have an infant son named Wundarr, whom they plan to save from their world's destruction. They place him aboard a ship that is able to maintain his life support as long as necessary, and then launch him into outer space. Hektu and Soja later make flight and are captured and executed by the Internal Security Force to prevent them from alarming the populace. It is later found out that Hektu's apocalyptic prediction was incorrect, and that he sent his son away for nothing. In July, 1951, Wundarr's ship is caught by Earth's gravitational pull, and passes through a layer of cosmic rays before entering Earth's atmosphere and crashing in a Florida swamp. An elderly couple known only as Maw and Paw observe the crash from their car. Paw considers checking out the crash site, but Maw insists that it might contain Martians or Communists and demands that he ignore it; thus, Wundarr remains in his ship for a number of years, growing to physical maturity, though retaining the mind of a child. Twenty years later, Man-Thing senses someone inside the rocket, and is compelled to free whatever is trapped inside. Man-Thing being the first creature Wundarr sees, he is convinced that this is his mother. Man-Thing, being emotionless, does not react to Wundarr's cravings for attention. He learns very quickly of his amazing strength and bests Man-Thing in battle. Man-Thing's continued attempts to be left alone result in Wundarr eventually deciding that Man-Thing is not his mother.Adventure into Fear #17 (Oct. 1973) With his great leaping ability, he eventually reaches Hydro-Base, where Namor and Namorita are trying to rehabilitate the population of Hydro-Men. Namor believes that Wundarr is a malicious intruder and quickly scares him off. Two Dakkam officials, Tuumar and Zeneg, believe that Wundarr may seek to avenge his father and send a Mortoid robot to assassinate him. Wundarr's leaps bring him down in New York City, where he encounters Ben Grimm walking home from a screening of the martial arts film Five Fingers of Death. Landing in the middle of traffic, Wundarr is hurt and lashes back childishly, throwing the cars around. Ben pulls no punches trying to stop him, but quickly realizes he is not dealing with a supervillain. Namor and Namorita, having followed Wundarr, try to restrain Ben, which leads to fisticuffs between Namor and Ben.Marvel Two-in-One #2 (Mar. 1974) and Marvel Two-in-One #4 (July 1974). Tuumar and Zeneg use the opportunity to attempt to kill Wundarr \\"for tranquility.\\" When Ben and Namor team up and destroy the Mortoid, Tuumar and Zeneg flee, and Ben is left to be \\"Unca Benjy\\" to Wundarr, whom Reed Richards determines to be of high intellect, but with the knowledge and experience of a child. Reed builds Wundarr a containment suit that enables his body to expel small amounts of energy so that his body does not overload.Marvel Two-in-One #3 (May 1974). Wundarr also finds himself menaced by the Tiger Shark.Ms. Marvel (vol. 1) #15 (March 1978). =The Aquarian= Wundarr is captured by the Project Pegasus leaders in order to test his abilities.implied to have occurred some time before the events of Marvel Two-in-One #42 (Aug. 1978). During these tests, the project leaders decide to use his energy-dampening abilities to probe the Cosmic Cube, a device of great cosmic power. During the probing, the Cosmic Cube overloads Wundarr's mind and body, sending him into an autistic coma (though his energy-dampening field still functions).Marvel Two-in-One #42 (Aug. 1978). This overload of energy greatly boosts his abilities, both mental and physical, giving him his power \\"dampening\\" field.Marvel Two-in-One #53 (July 1979). Being in communication with the Cube, even for so short a time, he is granted great knowledge and a sense of purpose. He awakens from his coma, and is further transformed by the Cosmic Cube. In light of his new knowledge, he renames himself the Aquarian. His new power allows him to defeat the Nth Man.Marvel Two-in-One #55-58 (Sept.–Dec. 1979– Since then, he roams somewhat aimlessly, seeking to bring peace and enlightenment to the Earth. For a time, he leads the Water-Children, a philosophical cult dedicated to pacifism and awaiting the coming of the Celestial Messiah, and while teaching his group Aquarian is attacked by fellow Dakkamite Quantum, but is saved by the hero Quasar.Quasar #4 (Dec. 1989). Aquarian serves as a psychic \\"nesting place\\" for the Cosmic Cube, just before it awoke to sentience.Captain America Annual #7 (1983). Aquarian also aids Doctor Strange in preventing planet-wide disasters on Earth.Quasar #25 (Aug. 1991) and Quasar #28 (Nov. 1991). =The Initiative= After joining the Initiative program he is assigned a position on the Florida Initiative Team, The Command with Jennifer Kale and Siege. This team is the first to encounter the Marvel Zombies, who have made a breach into the Marvel Universe through the Nexus of Realities. He is then bitten on the shoulder by a zombified Deadpool whom Wundarr throws into the blades of a nearby skiff; Kale activates them, reducing Deadpool to a bloody pulp. Wundarr goes into a form of \\"hibernation\\" in an energy cocoon in order to stave off the zombie infection, and is later shown still in this state quarantined at A.R.M.O.R. headquarters.Marvel Zombies 3 #1 (Dec. 2008). Wundarr appears soon after, having recovered from the virus, and is shown defending Florida during the Skrull invasion of Earth.Avengers: The Initiative #19 (Jan. 2009). Later he is seen attending Ben Grimm's bachelor party.Fantastic Four #5 (Feb. 2019). Powers and abilities Exposure to cosmic rays granted superhuman powers to Wundarr, and radiation from the Earth's sun causes all Dakkamites to undergo further mutagenic effects. Initially, Wundarr could absorb energy directly into his body. This energy was converted into kinetic energy which could be used to increase his physical strength (allowing him to bench up to 15 tons), in leaping, or in energy projection. To keep him from building up more energy than his body could handle, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four built him a suit that would allow him to \\"drain\\" the energy in his body. After the exposure to the energies of the Cosmic Cube, the Aquarian's body generated a field around his body that nullified nearly all forms of energy (kinetic, electrical, magnetic, gamma, gravitational, etc.) that are higher than a certain preset level, which he calls his \\"null field\\". For example, a bullet contains a level of kinetic energy higher than what his Null field will allow for, so once the bullet enters his field, its energy is nullified. His own body is subject to this field, and he cannot move any faster than it will allow. This field naturally resides five feet from his body, and he cannot disable it; it is active at all times regardless of whether he is conscious or not. With concentration, however, he can contract this field to within five inches (127 mm), or expand it to . *Physical strength - He has a great deal of physical strength, as shown in his besting of Man-Thing in battle. After his confrontation with the Cosmic Cube, his strength was lowered to the point of benching 1 ton. *Leaping/flying - Wundarr has the ability to leap great distances. After his contact with The Cosmic Cube, however, his Null field negated any energy from leaping. However, since his Null field can negate gravity and wind, he can literally walk on air, via directed motion hovering. *Knowledge - After being in contact with the Cosmic Cube, he is left with an unimaginable knowledge which he calls \\"Everything and Nothing\\". He appears to have a strong grasp on the properties of life and death, as well as peace and discourse. He is sometimes shown transmitting (through touch) this knowledge to other beings, often in order to create harmony.

In the introduction, Suresha asserts that Bears on Bears is \\"the first interview book ... compiled primarily from online interactions\\" using online chat technology.Bears on Bears, 2002, Introduction, p. xix A bisexual-identified man and bi rights advocate, Suresha edited, with Peter Chvany, the nonfiction book Bi Men : Coming Out Every Which Way (2006). Suresha's two bisexual men's anthologies were named finalists in the 2006 Lambda Literary Awards (Lammys) in Bisexual Literature. In 2008, Suresha edited for Journal of Bisexuality a special issue commemorating the sexagennial (60th) anniversary of the publication of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, commonly known as the Kinsey Report, as Bisexual Perspectives on the Life and Work of Alfred C. Kinsey, which was named a finalist in the 2008 Lambda Literary Awards in Bisexual Literature. That year, Suresha became acquisitions editor for Bear Bones Books, an imprint of LGBT publisher Lethe Press, which released a revised edition of his Bears on Bears, including five additional interviews. The imprint has also reissued several men's fiction anthologies he edited under the pseudonym R. Jackson. Suresha published in 2011 a folklore collection of humorous tales about the character Nasreddin, The Uncommon Sense of the Immortal Mullah Nasruddin from Lethe Press, which was named a Storytelling World Honor Title in 2012 in the adult collections category, and which received a 2013 Anne Izard Storytellers' Choice Award. With Scott McGillivray, Suresha compiled and wrote a 2012 photobook, Fur: The Love of Hair, for German publisher Bruno Gmünder Verlag, which received a Rainbow Book Award. In 2014, Suresha edited an anthology of poetry written by and for men of the bear community, Hibernation and Other Poems by Bear Bards, which was named a Rainbow Book Award winner in both the LGBTQ Poetry and Bisexuality categories. In 2014 he published a second collection of Nasreddin stories, Extraordinary Adventures of Mullah Nasruddin, named a Lambda Literary Award Finalist.

ABCANZ Armies (formally, the American, British, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Armies' Program) is a program aimed at optimizing interoperability and standardization of training and equipment between the armies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus the United States Marine Corps and the Royal Marines. Established in 1947 as a means to capitalize on close cooperation between the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada during World War II, the program grew to include Australia (in 1963) and New Zealand (as an observer from 1965, with full membership in 2006). History The program started in 1947 as the \\"Plan to Effect Standardization\\" between the armies of the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada (the ABC Armies), with the three nations looking to capitalize on the close cooperation between the forces during World War II. In 1954, the Plan was replaced by the \\"Basic Standardization Concept\\". Australia joined the organization in 1963, and the ABCA Program was established with the ratification of the \\"Basic Standardization Agreement 1964\\" on 1 October 1964. In 1965, Australia successfully sponsored the introduction of New Zealand to the agreement as an observer. Originally, the role of ABCANZ was limited to issues of standardization for soldier equipment, training, and tactics. Following the September 11 attacks, a review by the Program's Heads of Delegations saw the Program modified to address the changing security environment and improve responsiveness, relevance, and focus on interoperability. The overhaul was completed by June 2004. Also in 2004, the increasing involvement of the United States Marine Corps was formally recognized with a Memorandum of Understanding between the Corps and the United States Army, allowing both forces to be represented by a single position. Following this, the United Kingdom delegation successfully incorporated the Royal Marines.

Hercules and Antaeus, oil painting, 1690s. Gregorio de Ferrari (c. 1647–1726) was an Italian Baroque painter of the Genoese school. Biography De Ferrari was born in Porto Maurizio. He came to Genoa to study law but instead became a painter. He apprenticed with Domenico Fiasella from 1664–69, and in this period he may have painted in the style of Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari and Giovanni Battista Casone. He assisted Fiasella on the altarpiece St Clare Repulsing the Saracens (1667) for the parish church in Montoggio. =Parma= He travelled to Parma (staying from 1669 to 1673), where he worked in quadratura frescoes. It was here where he abandoned Fiasella's monumental style in favour of a more characteristic, lyrical style. He also made copies of Correggio's frescoes in the dome of the Parma cathedral, two of which - Rest on the Flight to Egypt and Virgin with St. Jerome and the Magdalene - were later listed as the property of Anton Raphael Mengs. During this time he may have exchanged ideas with Giovanni Battista Gaulli and Andrea Carlone, both of whom informed his style of work as evidenced by certain qualities adopted after his return to Genoa, such as graceful elongations and vertical spiral movements of the figures, which in turn suggests additional influence by the sculptors Filippo Parodi and Bernardo Schiaffino. =Return to Genoa= Gregorio made two works inspired by Coreggio, St. Francis Comforted by an Angel and the Rest on the Flight to Egypt, dated from 1674 to 1675. He ultimately joined his father-in-law, Domenico Piola, in the prolific studio known as Casa Piola, which was founded in the 1660s. They were both active in the decoration of the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato. They worked in styles that blended Cortona, Correggio, and Castiglione's styles. In 1674, he painted the Glory of St Gaestano in a vault in the church of San Siro, and it is known that he received payment in 1676 for a treatment of the Glory of St Andrew in an adjoining vault. Later, in 1681, he painted St Clare Repulsing the Saracens, a \\"...dramatic work, with flickering light and twisting draperies.\\" (Turner 1996, 9) During the 1680s Gregorio joined Andrea Seghizzi, who worked as quadraturista, to fresco several ceilings in the Palazzo Balbi-Senarega, and produced a preliminary sketch for architectural decoration and allegorical figures. In 1682 he was commissioned to paint two works (St Lawrence and St Stephen) in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato. During the Bombardment of Genoa, he frescoed an Allegory of Time and sculpted a frieze in the drawing room of the Villa Gropallo. He later frescoed two vaults of the Palazzo Rosso to accompany two rooms completed by Piola. By 1689, he had frescoed the Brignole Sale drawing room with the Myth of Phaeton and painted a small cupola fresco in its chapel (both since destroyed). Gregorio and Piola worked in the same ornamental style, but differed in that, while Piola delineated each figure in his composition clearly, Gregorio took interest in \\"arranging twisting, elongating figures to soar through space in a swirl of arms, legs and draperies.\\" (ibid., 8) He worked with Piola again in the Palazzo Granello, where he frescoed two rooms with Cupid and Psyche and Neptune and Amphitrite. Circa 1690, Gregorio frescoed a large vault in the Santi Giacomo e Filippo with an Assumption of the Virgin. He also designed the surrounding quadratura, which was frescoed by Francesco Costa. This creative treatment of the subject was appreciated by the commander of the French fleet, Jacques Bailli de Noailles, who asked Gregorio to work in Marseille. Here he worked from 1692 to 1694, painting decorative frescoes and canvases with his son Lorenzo, after which he returned to Genoa. In 1694 he was commissioned to fresco the vault of San Paolo in Campetto (since destroyed), where he painted a treatment of The Glory of Saint Paul. Five years later, he was possibly commissioned to paint the Death of Saint Scholastica and the Virgins and Souls in Purgatory, for which he was paid in 1703. He is known to have restored Andrea Ansaldo's dome in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato between 1700 and 1705, his work being evident in some of the painted figures. In his later years he turned to modeling and colouring paper papier-mâché and plaster figures. His later paintings, such as the Pool of Bethesda, tended to be smaller in scale, often of landscapes with architectural details. His last fresco decoration was for the cupola, apse and chapels in the SS. Camillo e Croce, most of which were completed between 1715 and 1726 with the help of Lorenzo. Surviving drawings attest to his role in designing the lunette in the apse, Heraklios Carrying the Cross to Jerusalem. =Legacy= His method of completing a painting — slowly, piece by piece — can be seen in paintings such as Moses Striking the Rock and the Virgin of Lepanto, with their varied figure scale and panoramic setting, both of which he completed with his son, Lorenzo. Like Piola, Gregorio also designed for various media. It is possible he offered designs for Filippo Parodi's Morosoni tomb in the Tolentini in Venice, and he designed a frontispiece portrait of Francesco Invrea which was engraved by Martial Desbois. He passed his skill in composing intricate quadratura to his students, Francesco Costa, Imperiale Bottini and his son Lorenzo. His Death of Santa Scolastica in San Stefano of Genoa is considered his masterpiece. Among the children of Gregorio and his wife, Margherita Piola, was the painter Lorenzo de' Ferrari, as well as his lesser-known brother, an art restorer named Giuseppe.

A controversy arose in Calvinist, Reformed, and Presbyterian circles in response to views expressed at a 2002 conference entitled The Federal Vision: An Examination of Reformed Covenantalism. The ongoing controversy involves several Reformed denominations including the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC), the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the United Reformed Churches in North America (URCNA), and the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States (RPCUS), and the Protestant Reformed Churches in America (PRCA).  Influences  Proponents of Federal Vision theology view themselves as influenced by the Protestant Reformers, especially those responsible for drawing up the Westminster Confession.. They argue that the influences of their theology are not limited to the work of pre-Great Awakening writers, however. They find precedent for their beliefs through the Awakenings and up to the present day....  History and controversy  In January 2002 Auburn Avenue Presbyterian Church (PCA) in Monroe, Louisiana (now Church of the Redeemer, West Monroe, Louisiana), hosted its annual pastors' conference with speakers Douglas Wilson, John Barach, Steve Wilkins, and Steve Schlissel addressing the topic \\"The Federal Vision: An Examination of Reformed Covenantalism.\\" The organizers and speakers intended the conference to provide a positive covenantal (i.e., federal) view (i.e., vision) of issues such as assurance of salvation and child-rearing. In June 2002, the RPCUS, a small Presbyterian denomination, issued a public call for repentance by the four speakers, charging them with \\"a fundamental denial of the essence of the Christian Gospel in the denial of justification by faith alone\\" and with \\"introducing false hermeneutic principles; the infusion of sacerdotalism; and the redefinition of [certain] doctrines...\\". As a result of this response and further debate and discussion regarding the conference teaching, the theological views presented at the conference came to be known as Federal Vision theology or Auburn Avenue theology. In addition to the original four conference speakers, a number of men have identified themselves as proponents of Federal Vision theology by signing a document entitled \\"A Joint Federal Vision Profession.\\" Signers include Randy Booth, Tim Gallant, Mark Horne, James B. Jordan, Peter Leithart, Rich Lusk, and Ralph A. Smith.. A number of these men have particular areas of theological interest. For instance, Gallant writes mostly on paedocommunion, and Smith on the Trinity. As of 2017, Douglas Wilson no longer identifies with the Federal Vision label, though he stated that the change \\"...does not represent any substantial shift or sea change in the content of what I believe.\\" Those who oppose Federal Vision theology include E. Calvin Beisner,. R. Scott Clark,. Ligon Duncan,. David Engelsma,. J. V. Fesko,. Michael Horton, Joseph Pipa, John Robbins,. Brian Schwertley,. Morton H. Smith, David Van Drunen and Guy Waters.. =Ecclesiastical responses= In addition to the RPCUS’s 2002 response, several other Reformed and Presbyterian denominations have ruled on the orthodoxy of Federal Vision or are currently in the process of doing so: * In 2006, The Orthodox Presbyterian Church's \\"Report on Justification\\" did \\"not condemn all of the views of those mentioned herein [but] does agree that aberrant views on justification have been promulgated from within these circles,\\" and it reaffirmed its commitment to the traditional understanding of the doctrine of justification and offered a critique of the Federal Vision.. * In 2007, the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) appointed a study committee to examine the issue, and that committee produced a report which \\"is to be given due and serious consideration by the church and its courts\\" concluding that the teachings of Federal Vision on election, justification, and other doctrines are contrary to the Westminster Standards, the PCA’s doctrinal standards. * In June 2009, the Reformed Church in the United States rejected Federal Vision theology as not being in accordance with its doctrinal standards. * At the 2010 Synod, the URCNA passed a 60-page report condemning Federal Vision as heresy. In reply to these denominational criticisms, several Federal Vision proponents developed and signed a \\"Joint Federal Vision Profession,\\" which briefly outlines what they affirm and what they deny in each of the controverted areas.. Auburn Avenue Presbyterian Church, the church at which the original 2002 conference was held, has revised and republished its statement on \\"Covenant, Baptism, and Salvation,\\" which they state was \\"not intended to erect some new standard of orthodoxy or to imply that we were settled on these points and could not be challenged or dissuaded from them, and it was certainly not intended to erect another wall to divide the Church or as a means to denounce or exclude from fellowship our brothers who might disagree with us,\\" and that it was \\"a response to the critique and instruction we have received and is an effort to make our position more clear and (we trust) more easily understood. We continue to study and learn and continue to be open to further correction and instruction.\\".  General beliefs  The leading proponents of Federal Vision theology are Reformed, and consider their understanding of these issues to be, with some exceptions, in keeping with the major Reformed confessions: the Three Forms of Unity and the Westminster Confession of Faith. The following subsections outline the distinctives and particular emphases of the Federal Vision as outlined in the \\"Joint Federal Vision Statement\\". = Trinity = Proponents of the Federal Vision believe the trinitarian relationships among the Godhead to be the model for all covenantal relationships and the foundation for understanding the Bible. Following Van Til and Rushdoony,. they claim that the Trinity is the only acceptable solution to the philosophical \\"one and many problem.\\" Their Trinitarian theology influences all areas of their theology, particularly their view of the covenant.. = Postmillennial eschatology = Advocates of the Federal Vision believe that Christ will not physically return to Earth until the Earth is as \\"full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea\\" (Habakkuk 2:14), which postmillennialists believe refers to the conversion of the majority of the world to Christ. While this is consistent with postmillennial doctrine, not all Federal Visionists are postmillennial. = Covenant objectivity = The central distinctive of the Federal Vision is its view of the covenant. In keeping with the historic Reformed understanding of Covenant Theology,. Federal Vision proponents argue that God has had two covenants with humanity throughout history: the first pre-Fall and the second post-Fall. The second covenant was progressively expanded throughout the Old Testament in various advanced covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic and Davidic), and reached its climax with Jesus and the New Covenant. What distinguishes the Federal Vision from other interpretations of Covenant Theology is its view of the nature of the covenant, namely that the covenant is \\"objective\\" and that all covenant members are part of God’s family whether or not they are decretally elect. It is an admixture of covenant objectivity and God's predestinating power in election that has resulted in the Federal Vision position on the covenant. Because Federal Vision leaders believe the Old Testament argued for corporate election of all Israel, so too does the New Testament for all who are in the Church. This results in a distinction in election – there are the decreed elect (that precise number God intends to save and who will persevere in their faith) and the covenantally elect (those who are predestined to be a follower of Christ for a time, but are not predestined to persevere in their faith and who will eventually fall away). Consider Lusk's comment: He goes on to speak of apostates within the covenant: Proponents of the Federal Vision claim to reflect the authentic views of John Calvin on election and covenantal objectivity, citing Calvin's distinction between common election and special election: \\"Although the common election is not effectual in all, yet may it set open a gate for the special elect.\\", an excerpt from his comments on Acts 3:25. Calvin wrote concerning effectual calling, Advocates of the Federal Vision believe that in the covenant, God promises certain blessings for faithful living, and promises curses for unfaithful living (based on Deuteronomy 28), which makes the covenant objective. Once a person has entered the covenant through baptism, he cannot escape its consequences. If, through unbelief, he lives a life unfaithful to the covenant or abandons it, he will be subject to God's curses and displeasure. = Baptism = Proponents of the Federal Vision have a view of baptism that they argue returns to the beliefs of the original Reformers, particularly John Calvin. This baptismal view is different from both Roman Catholic and contemporary Protestant beliefs on baptism. Douglas Wilson writes: To them, baptism is the entrance into both the covenant and the church. As a result of the covenantal union between the act of baptism and the work of the Holy Spirit, Federal Vision advocates affirm a form of baptismal regeneration that they argue is a return to Calvin's thought and the teachings of the historically Reformed.... This point has generated much controversy and confusion, because the advocates of the Federal Vision do not mean regeneration as the term is used today. Rather, they claim to employ the original sense of the word as used by the reformers. Louis Berkhof writes, \\"Calvin also used the term [regeneration] in a very comprehensive sense as a designation of the whole process by which man is renewed.\\". Critics point out, however, that all the benefits of saving union with Christ are associated with baptism by Federal Vision writers. Critics believe that this teaching more closely aligns them with Lutheran views of baptism. Using this definition of regeneration, the Federal Vision position is that physical and spiritual baptism should be seen as a unity normally. Rich Lusk writes, In his concluding analysis of the Federal Vision baptismal theology, Joseph Minich (who claims not to be an FV advocate) writes, \\"Baptism is not a 'work' performed, after which one can have full assurance. It is not another 'instrument' of justification alongside faith. Rather, it is a visible act of God (especially apparent in the case of infants) that is to be seen as the locus of Christian certainty. It is the place where God promises to meet His own. To look to baptism for assurance is not to look for salvation in 'water,' but to cling to the place where God promises to meet His people and bless them.\\". Those associated with the Federal Vision often include under the name \\"Christian\\" all who have been baptized in the name of the Triune God. = Communion = The Federal Vision emphasizes the blessings that come from partaking in communion as the nourishing feast of the covenant. While denying both mere symbolism and the presence of Christ in the elements themselves, they believe that Christ's presence with the church in the sacrament has sanctifying effects.. Advocates of the Federal Vision are proponents of paedocommunion, the participation of small children in communion. They argue that accepting small children to the Table was the classic Christian position until the 14th century,. and that all covenant members, including children should be admitted to the table unless they are under formal church discipline. Paedocommunion is not an exclusively Federal Vision position. Non–Federal Vision Reformed advocates of paedocommunion include C. John Collins, Curtis Crenshaw, Gary North and Andrew Sandlin. Non-Reformed Evangelical supporters include William Willimon and N. T. Wright. Opponents of paedocommunion argue that the practice is not in keeping with classical Calvinist theology, noting that traditional Reformed teaching and practice requires a communicant to be capable of self-examination, according to St. Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 11. = Biblical theology and typology = One of the foundational distinctives of the Federal Vision movement is the method which they use to interpret the Bible. Rather than treating Bible interpretation as a science or a method, they consider it much more of an intuitive art. Rich Lusk says, Biblical theology methods of interpretation do not treat the Bible as a collection of facts and doctrines as systematic theology does. Rather, it treats the Bible as a great story of God's redemptive and transformative purposes in the world for the world. Thus, interpreting the Bible through the typological system means emphasizing literary analysis and the flow of the overarching Story through each of the smaller, individual stories. This method of interpretation has been around since the Church Fathers, and writers such as Geerhardus Vos and other 19th century Presbyterian theologians have contributed to the present Presbyterian understanding. In 19th century German Protestantism, typological interpretation was distinguished from rectilinear interpretation of prophecy. The former was associated with Hegelian theologians and the latter with Kantian analyticity. In the 20th century, typological interpretation was fleshed out by David Chilton and Meredith G. Kline, but especially by theologian James B. Jordan, whose books on typology (such as Through New Eyes), and the commentaries of Peter Leithart serve as the interpretive foundations for the Federal Vision theology. Adherents of the Federal Vision often make use of and recommend the general interpretive works of Sidney Greidanus, Christopher J. H. Wright, Richard Gaffin, N. T. Wright, Stanley Hauerwas, George Stroup, Richard Hays, Rikk Watts, Willard Swartley, Sylvia Keesmaat, Ben Witherington, J Ross Wagner, Don Garlington, Craig Evans, Steve Moyise, and David Pao. Typological hermeneutics are not mentioned explicitly in the \\"Joint Federal Vision Statement\\". = Imputation = Another controversial aspect of the Federal Vision theology is the denial of the imputation of Christ’s active obedience in His earthly life. Theologians involved with the Federal Vision are not agreed on the denial of imputation. James Jordan has denied that any part of Christ’s earthly works are imparted to believers.. Norman Shepherd is in agreement with him.. Peter Leithart has publicly said in a letter to PCA Pacific Northwest Presbytery that Rich Lusk’s position seems to be the closest to a representative position for the Federal Vision theologians as a whole. First, he does not deny Christ’s active obedience: Similarly, James Jordan writes \\"that there is a double imputation of our sins to Jesus and His glory to us is certainly beyond question, and I am not disagreeing with the general doctrine of imputation, or of double imputation.\\" What the Federal Vision proponents do question is whether Christ's earthly works do us any good. Jordan says: Lusk agrees: Rather, the Federal Vision theologians see believers as being in \\"union with Christ,\\" as partaking of Christ's resurrection and glorified Life, rather than believers getting righteousness credit given to them. Lusk again: Both Andrew Sandlin. and Norman Shepherd agree that union with Christ's resurrection life, rather than the imputation of Christ's earthly obedient works, is how sinners are justified before God. Despite internal disagreement on the matter, Federal Vision theologians are agreed that  Federal Vision and the New Perspectives on Paul  Some critics of Federal Vision theology have connected it with the New Perspective on Paul. Federal Vision proponents have sought to maintain a distinction between the two theologies while acknowledging that they do have some general ideas in common. Yet many critics of the Federal Vision still group the two movements together. Outspoken critic Guy Waters notes, Proponent James B. Jordan says similarly, Douglas Wilson has noted six foundational tenets of the NPP.. He affirms the correctness of points 1–3. # Justification by faith was present in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. # Faith and works are not opposed to one another in the Bible. Faith was always present, even in the Old Testament. The Jews were not trying to earn anything by works. # Law and grace are not opposed to one another, or that the Old Testament was mostly law and the New Testament was mostly grace. # Paul's primary focus was not individual salvation, but corporate salvation. # Judaism was not a religion based on salvation by works or merit. # Judaism satisfied Paul's burden of guilt; rather than what the Old Perspective thought, that Judaism could not ease Paul's conscience. Most of the Federal Vision proponents have publicly said they appreciate much of what NT Wright has written. Both Mark Horne..... and Rich Lusk... have defended Wright against his Reformed critics. Horne has said that the NPP \\"is not a rejection of the Reformed doctrine.\\". Lusk has said virtually the same thing, saying that Wright \\"is a true sola scriptura Protestant.\\". Douglas Wilson has called Wright a \\"Christian gentleman\\" who \\"has a lot to contribute,\\" and has commended Wright's insistence that Paul is a \\"thorough-going covenant theologian,\\" but has also leveled criticism at Wright: Peter Leithart, Steve Wilkins and Steve Schlissel share similarities theologically with the NPP, though they have not publicly said they have consciously shaped their theology after Wright's. Leithart, however, has said that Federal Vision theology \\"is stimulated by Anglican New Testament scholar NT Wright...\\".

Each state contains one or more state plane zones, the boundaries of which usually follow county lines. There are 110 zones in the contiguous US, with 10 more in Alaska, 5 in Hawaii, and one for Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands. The system is widely used for geographic data by state and local governments. Its popularity is due to at least two factors. First, it uses a simple Cartesian coordinate system to specify locations rather than a more complex spherical coordinate system (the geographic coordinate system of latitude and longitude). By using the Cartesian coordinate system's simple XY coordinates, \\"plane surveying\\" methods can be used, speeding up and simplifying calculations. Second, the system is highly accurate within each zone (error less than 1:10,000). Outside a specific state plane zone accuracy rapidly declines, thus the system is not useful for regional or national mapping. Most state plane zones are based on either a transverse Mercator projection or a Lambert conformal conic projection. The choice between the two map projections is based on the shape of the state and its zones. States that are long in the east–west direction are typically divided into zones that are also long east–west. These zones use the Lambert conformal conic projection, because it is good at maintaining accuracy along an east–west axis, due to the projection cone intersecting the earth's surface along two lines of latitude. Zones that are long in the north–south direction use the transverse Mercator projection because it is better at maintaining accuracy along a north–south axis, due to the circumference of the projection cylinder being oriented along a meridian of longitude. The panhandle of Alaska, whose maximum dimension is on a diagonal, uses an Oblique Mercator projection, which minimizes the combined error in the X and Y directions. History In 1933, the North Carolina Department of Transportation asked the Coast and Geodetic Survey to assist in creating a comprehensive method for converting curvilinear coordinates (latitude and longitude) to a user-friendly, 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This request developed into the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), which is now the most widely used expression of coordinate information in local and regional surveying and mapping applications in the United States and its territories. It has been revised several times since then. When computers began to be used for mapping and GIS, the state plane system's cartesian grid system and simplified calculations made spatial processing faster and spatial data easier to work with. Even though computer processing power has improved radically since the early days of GIS, the size of spatial datasets and the complexity of geoprocessing tasks being demanded of computers have also increased. Thus the state plane coordinate system is still useful. Originally, the state plane coordinate systems were based on the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). Later, the more accurate North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) became the standard (a geodetic datum is the way a coordinate system is linked to the physical Earth). More recently there has been an effort to increase the accuracy of the NAD83 datum using technology that was not available in 1983. These efforts are known as \\"High Accuracy Reference Network\\" (HARN) or \\"High Precision GPS Network\\" (HPGN). In addition, the basic unit of distance used is sometimes feet and sometimes meters. Thus a fully described coordinate system often looks something like: \\"Washington State Plane North, NAD83 HARN, US Survey feet\\". This information is needed in order to accurately transform data from one coordinate system to another. Problems The main problem with the state plane coordinate system is that each zone uses a different coordinate system. This is not a major problem as long as one's needs are within the boundaries of a given state plane zone, as is the case with most county and city governments. However, the need to transform spatial data from one coordinate system to another can be burdensome. Sometimes a regional area of interest—such as a metropolitan area covering several counties—crosses a state plane zone boundary. The Seattle metropolitan area is an example of this. King County, which includes the City of Seattle, uses the \\"Washington State Plane North\\" coordinate system, while Pierce County, which includes the City of Tacoma, uses \\"Washington State Plane South\\". Thus any regional agency that wants to combine regional data from local governments has to transform at least some data into a common coordinate system.

The three bronze swords stand tall and are planted into the rock of a small hill next to the fjord. They commemorate the historic Battle of Hafrsfjord which by tradition took place there in the year 872, when King Harald Fairhair gathered all of Norway under one crown. The largest sword represents the victorious Harald, and the two smaller swords represent the defeated petty kings.

During the 1982 run, Al Green appeared with Patti Labelle in the show. Legacy The phrase first appeared in James Weldon Johnson's novel, \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,\\" which he attributed to a preacher named John Brown.

This allowed these factions to establish working administrations and eventually coherent states, and restored order to their regions. This occurred first in Puntland, Southwestern Somalia, Galmudug, Jubaland and finally Banadir. Somaliland In 1981, a group of Isaaq émigrés in London formed the Somali National Movement (SNM), who dedicated themselves to defeating Siad Barre, and invaded Northwestern Somalia via Ethiopia during the civil war. Siad Barre fought their forces for five years, but was eventually forced to withdraw from all of the former British Somaliland by 1991. The victorious SNM seized control of the territory and declared themselves independent on May 18, 1991. Puntland In 1981, three groups of Majertin anti-Siad Barre émigrés in Aden (then part of South Yemen) formed the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, with the purpose of fighting alongside Ethiopian forces in the Ogaden War against the Siad Barre regime. The invasion was withdrawn in 1982 when the United States sent emergency military aid to Somalia. The organization became divided increasingly along clan lines, leading to the imprisonment of many leading members including Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and the defection of many to the Siad Barre regime. During the civil war, the SSDF began consolidating their control over the northern Mudug, Nugaal and Bari regions. The Anarchy period saw the region torn apart with internecine factional fighting, and a determined attempt by al-Ittihad al-Islami to take over the region by force from their base in Bosaso, leading to an incredibly bloody war that the SSDF won at high cost. Finally in 1998, the SSDF along with the United Somali Party and the Somali National Democratic Union agreed to form a joint administration and state, that being Puntland. Ever since then, Puntland and Somaliland have been in a sometimes-violent dispute over the primarily Darod regions of Sool and Sanaag. Maakhir Maakhir (Makhir) is a self-proclaimed autonomous state within Somaliland declared Independent on July 1, 2007 on an area \\"disputed\\" by Somaliland and Puntland. Maakhir's template of self-governance rests on the building block system endorsed by the International community as a way of reconstituting the collapsed state of Somalia. This system of local level government in Somalia is seen as a workable long-term strategy in resolving inter-clan conflicts and building institutions such as police, court system and a local military that protects and safeguards services of International NGOs as well as the provisions of United Nations Development Program. This autonomous state later joined Somaliland and they have representatives in the Somaliland Parliament. Jubaland Those factions loyal to Siad Barre, especially amongst his own Marehan clan, formed the Somali National Front after he was deposed from power, were based primarily in this region, where they withdrew to following the end of the civil war. In around Kismayo, there were fighting between the fleeing Darood sub-clans from Mogadishu for the control of the city, the northern Harti clans led by Mohamed Hersi Morgan and his militia the SPM, and the Marehan clans led by Ahmed Warsame and his militia the SNF. SPM-Harti withdrew from the city the following the loss of the war. The state of Jubaland was established on September 3, 1998, but this government survived less than a year before being driven out by the several factions of the Somali National Front, forming a new united regime over all of Jubaland, the Juba Valley Alliance on June 11, 1999. The JVA chose to join the Transitional National Government (TNG) on June 18, 2001, but in January 2006 they changed their minds and formed their own autonomous state of Jubaland. This state lasted less than a year, as the Union of Islamic Courts brought over to their side numerous factions of the JVA and took over Kismayo without firing a shot on September 24, 2006. Southwestern Somalia The Rahanweyn clan did not take an active role in the early civil war, choosing instead to sit out the conflict. However, during the height of the Anarchy, Mohamed Farah Aideed's militias invaded Baidoa, seizing control of the most important city of the Rahanweyn, on September 17, 1995. In response to this Rahanweyn leaders met at Jhaffey on October 13, 1995 and agreed to form a united force to resist Aideed, the Rahanweyn Resistance Army (RRA). The RRA eventually chose instead to form their own state of Southwestern Somalia on April 1, 2002. The leadership first supported the Transitional National Government (TNG), but then divided over the switch to support the rival Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC). Some remained loyal to the TNG movement. Both sides eventually reconciled and supported the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and played host to them in Baidoa. Transitional Governments There are two distinct phases of the transitional government: the Transitional National Government (TNG) and the Transitional Federal Government: *The Transitional National Government (TNG) was formed in April–May 2000 at the Somalia National Peace Conference (SNPC) in Djibouti. It had the following: ** 2000: Election of Abdiqasim Salad Hassan as President by the tribal/faction representatives ** 2001: National Commission for Reconciliation and Property Settlement ** 2002: Somali Reconciliation Conference in Eldoret, Kenya * The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in October–November 2004 in Nairobi, Kenya with the adoption of the following Transitional Federal Institutions (TFI), all accomplished by the end of the sessions: ** Selection of 275 Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) members ** Approval of the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC) ** Election of Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed as President by the Parliament (October 10) as head of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and appointment of the Council of Ministers, including Prime Minister Ali Mohammed Ghedi (November 4). =Transitional National Government= A conference in the Djibuti resort town of Arta succeeded in ending the violence between USC factions, and made strides towards unity, but failed to set up a comprehensive government. Many factions refused to attend as they could not set the terms of reconciliation, and their backer, Ethiopia, was against the TNG. These pro-Ethiopia factions formed their own pan-tribal national government movement, the Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council (SRRC). =Transitional Federal Government= A second attempt at forming a more comprehensive national government was undertaken in Kenya. This time the fraction leaders were allowed to set terms, and Ethiopia granted the influence it desired. The government moved to Jowhar and Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed was elected president by the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP), bringing Puntland into the Transitional Federal Government (TFG). Because of the terms of the reconciliation, the factions and fraction leaders remained completely autonomous fiefdoms, and the TFG became more of a Somali League of Nations in miniature, and virtually powerless. Disputes were still violently contested, such as the infighting between Mohamed Ibrahim Habsade and his fellow RRA leaders Hassan Mohamed Nuur \\"Shatigudud\\" and Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe over control of Baidoa in 2005. All three were members of the new Parliament, and the two latter leaders were even ministers of government. Union of Islamic Courts In 1984 two reactionary Islamist organizations, al-Jamma al-Islamiya (Islamic Association) led by Sheikh Mohammed Eissa (based in the south), and Wahdat al-Shabab al-Islam (Unity of Islamic Youth) led by Sheikh Ali Warsame, met in Burao in northern Somalia in order to form a new united organization to topple the regime of Siad Barre: al-Ittihad al-Islami. The objective of this united organization was twofold: One, to defeat Siad Barre and establish an Islamic state in Somalia and two, to unify Greater Somalia (Djibouti, northeastern Kenya, and the Somali region of Ethiopia) into this state. During the civil war, AIAI established a firm foothold in the two bastions of power of its two component parts, the Gedo region and in the northwest, and undertook a bold expansionist policy during the anarchy period, conquering their own independent territory at Bosaso in 1992. However, Ethiopia invaded Gedo several times and crushed the AIAI, occupying Gedo for several years, and Puntland succeeded in crushing the AIAI in the north in 1992/93. The blow to the AIAI was crushing and the organization essentially dissolved into tiny independent Islamic Courts scattered throughout the areas in Somalia where Ethiopia and Puntland, or anyone else for that matter, had no influence, the lawless central region. These courts fell back on their roots as a social movement, rather than a revolutionary one, and began offering legal arbitration by Sharia and social services, slowly rebuilding their support. During this time, the courts revolutionary element was diluted by more moderate elements who were attracted primarily by the social aspects of the movement, striking a balance between the two. This state of affairs persisted for many years until 11 of these courts based in Mogadishu banded together to form the Islamic Courts Union, with a much more appealing agenda: restore law and order. Appealing that is to everyone except the fraction leaders, who exemplified criminal despotism, and by May 2006 the UIC was in an all out street war with the fraction leaders, who had banded together and secured US financial backing in order to defeat them. It was not enough however, and the UIC achieved total victory on June 6, 2006. The UIC swept out of Mogadishu and linked up with independent courts throughout central Somalia, forging an administration that rapidly eclipsed all other states in Somalia by August 16, 2006. Galmudug Various clan elders led by the Sacad subclan of the Habir Gidir declared Galmudug to be a state on August 14, 2006 in southern Galkacyo, Galinsoor and Bandiradley, which would come to encompass all of southern Mudug.

Educated at Purdue and MIT as a chemical engineer, he had a lifetime interest in map projections as a hobby, but found the calculations tedious without the benefit of expensive calculators or computers. At a cartography conference in 1976, he learned of the need for a map projection that would suit the special needs of LandSat satellite imagery. He had recently been able to purchase a pocket calculator (TI-59) of his own and set to work creating what became known as the space-oblique mercator projection, which he provided to the USGS at no charge. He was subsequently offered a job within the USGS within two years, where his work apparently led him to the eventual publication of the definitive technical guide to map projections entitled Map Projections: A Working Manual among other works. He also authored Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections which details the historical development of hundreds of map projections. Snyder developed at least one other projection, called GS50, which uses a complex polynomial to project the 50 U.S. states with minimal distortion. He taught courses on map projection at George Mason University. He was president of the American Cartographic Association (now CaGIS) from 1990–1991 and also served as a secretary to the Washington Map Society. John Snyder died April 28, 1997.

Service The 24th Wisconsin was organized at Milwaukee, Wisconsin and mustered into Federal service August 15, 1862. The regiment's flag was provided by citizens of Madison, who had promised it to the first regiment to reach full recruitment. The regiment served under generals Grant and Sherman and was engaged in the battles Stone's River, Chickamauga, Franklin, Nashville, Missionary Ridge and Chattanooga. The regiment was mustered out on June 10, 1865, at Nashville, Tennessee. The regimental adjutant was Arthur MacArthur Jr. (later rose to Lieutenant General and father of General Douglas MacArthur). By the end of the war, MacArthur had risen to second in command of the regiment with the rank of colonel at the age of only 19. On September 5, 1912 Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur died while addressing his old unit. The original 24th Wisconsin Infantry United States flag was then draped over the former commanding officer and thus the tradition of burial flags was born. MacArthur also coined the Wisconsin state slogan when he cried \\"On Wisconsin\\" as he led his men up Missionary Ridge at the battle of Chattanooga, a feat for which he would later receive the Medal of Honor. Another officer in the regiment was 1st Lieutenant John L. Mitchell. Mitchell later became a United States Senator and was the father of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell - an outspoken and controversial advocate of air power. By great coincidence, Arthur MacArthur's son Douglas was a juror for the court martial of John Mitchell's son Billy in 1925. Casualties The 24th Wisconsin suffered 8 officers and 103 enlisted men killed in action or who later died of their wounds, plus another 3 officers and 87 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 201 fatalities.

Career Ohki had hopes of becoming a student of Japanese wrestling legend Rikidōzan, another Korean, and entered Japan illegally in 1958 to do so, but was arrested in 1959. After being released he was able to train with Rikidōzan and joined the Japan Wrestling Association, debuting in November 1959 under his real name. On September 30, 1960, Ohki defeated fellow rookie Kanji Inoki, later Antonio Inoki, who was making his debut along with Shohei Baba, later Giant Baba. Ohki, Baba and Inoki were considered a part of a rookie trio groomed to become the eventual successors to Rikidōzan himself. Ohki was also trained by Mr. Moto and Yoshinosato. With Rikidōzan's murder in 1963 Ohki returned to his homeland to raise the profile of professional wrestling there, but returned to the JWA when Toyonobori and Inoki left the promotion, though he returned the next year. Also in 1967 Ohki became the top star in Korea with his defeat of Mark Lewin to win the Worldwide Wrestling Associates World Heavyweight Championship. With this the JWA wanted to rename him to Rikidōzan but the plan never went through. Inoki and Baba famously left the JWA in 1972 to found the All Japan and New Japan promotions in 1972, letting Ohki become the JWA's top star, winning the NWA International Heavyweight Championship. In April 1973 the JWA closed and was absorbed into All Japan, and though he competed for the new organization for a time he wrestled mostly as a freelancer in Japan and a main event star in South Korea, famously wrestling against his former fellow rookies Inoki and Baba in 1974 and 1975. He defended the NWA International title in IPW and South Korea until ordered by the NWA to vacate it in 1981. Since then Ohki did not compete much, with his official retirement card on April 2, 1995, held at a Weekly Pro-Wrestling magazine sponsored show at the Tokyo Dome in Japan. Wrestling legend Lou Thesz assisted the wheelchair-bound Ohki at this, his last public appearance in Japan.

A head coach in three sports, Graves was primarily a baseball coach, and led three college programs for a total of 32 seasons. He began at the University of Alabama for four seasons (1912–1915), spent another four at Texas A&M; University (1916–1919), and finished with 24 seasons the University of Washington (1923–1946). In the sport of football, he was a college head coach for seven seasons: at Alabama (1911–1914), Texas A&M; (1918), and the Agricultural College of the State of Montana—now Montana State University (1920–1921), compiling a career record of 32–18–4. In basketball, he served as a head coach for six years: at Alabama (1912–1915), Texas A&M; (1915–1916), and Montana Agricultural (1920–1922). At Washington, he was a longtime assistant coach in football and basketball, and later an assistant athletic director. In the summer of 1912, Graves was the manager of the La Junta Railroaders, a minor league baseball team in Colorado of the short-lived Rocky Mountain League. Early years Born in Missouri, Graves was one of ten children of a doctor, and his two given names were surnames of two physicians. He played college football at Missouri from 1906 to 1908, and after his eligibility was used up in the Midwest, he moved to the Northwest and played at Idaho on the Palouse for a season in 1909. After college, Graves played baseball in the minor leagues. Coaching career =Baseball= Graves was the head coach at Alabama, Texas A&M;, and Washington, where he led the Huskies in Seattle for 24 seasons (1923–1946). Graves had a long-standing amicable rivalry with Buck Bailey of Washington State, whom he coached in baseball and football at Texas A&M.; =Football= After several years of playing baseball in the minors, he coached football at Alabama, Texas A&M;, and what is now Montana State. From 1911 to 1914, he led the Alabama program to a 21–12–3 record. In his only season at Texas A&M; in 1918, he compiled a 6–1 record. He then served as an assistant coach at Texas A&M; in 1919 under head coach Dana X. Bible. At Montana Agricultural in Bozeman, he had a 5–5–1 record over two seasons. While head coach of the baseball team at Washington, Graves also served as an assistant coach in football to several coaches. =Basketball= Graves was a head basketball coach for six seasons, the first three at Alabama, where he was the program's first coach and compiled a record of 20–12 () from 1912 to 1915. He later headed the Texas A&M; program for a season and two at Montana Agricultural. At Washington, he was an assistant coach for 24 seasons under head coach Hec Edmundson. Graves had met Edmundson at Idaho when they were undergraduate athletes, and both were head coaches at Texas A&M; in the spring of 1919, Edmundson in track and Graves in baseball. After coaching After stepping down as baseball coach at Washington, Graves became an assistant athletic director at the university, where he remained until his death. He was also involved with horse racing in the state as a race steward at Longacres in Renton and Playfair Race Course in Spokane. Death While visiting Pullman in the spring of 1959, Graves fell and broke a hip. That December, he was hospitalized in Seattle for treatment of a liver ailment and died several weeks later in January 1960 at age 73. He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Seattle, about a mile (1.6 km) northeast of the university. The UW athletic office building (1964) and the two former baseball fields (through 1997) were named for Graves; he was posthumously inducted into the Big W Club, the UW athletics hall of fame, in 1980.

Organotitanium chemistry is the science of organotitanium compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions. They are reagents in organic chemistry and are involved in major industrial processes.\\"Organotitanium Reagents in Organic Synthesis (Reactivity and Structure Concepts in Organic Chemistry, Vol 24)\\" Manfred T. Reetz 1986 Brief history Although the first attempt to prepare an organotitanium compound dates back to 1861, the first example was not reported until 1954. In that year titanocene dichloride was described by Wilkinson and Birmingham. Independently, titanium-based Ziegler–Natta catalysts were described leading to major commercial applications, for which the 1963 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded. This technology underscored the technical significance of organotitanium chemistry. Properties The reductive coupling of benzophenone in the McMurry reaction illustrates the oxophilicity of low valent titanium complexes. The titanium electron configuration ([Ar]3d24s2) vaguely resembles that of carbon and like carbon, the +4 oxidation state dominates. Titanium is however a much larger element than carbon, reflected by the Ti-C bond lengths being about 30% longer, e.g. 210 pm in tetrabenzyltitanium vs a typical C-C bond of 155 pm. Simple tetraalkyltitanium compounds however are not typically isolable, owing to the large size of titanium and the electron-deficient nature of its tetrahedral complexes. More abundant and more useful than the simple tetraalkyl compounds are mixed ligand complexes with alkoxide and cyclopentadienyl coligands. Titanium is capable of forming complexes with high coordination numbers. In terms of oxidation states, most organotitanium chemistry, in solution at least, focuses on derivatives of Ti(IV) and Ti(III). Ti(II) compounds are rarer, examples being titanocene dicarbonyl and Ti(CH3)2(dmpe)2. [Ti(CO)6]2− is formally a complex of Ti(-II).Elschenbroich, C. \\"Organometallics\\" (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Although Ti(III) is involved in Ziegler–Natta catalysis, the organic derivatives of Ti(III) are uncommon. One example is the dimer [Cp2TiIIICl]2. Due to the low electronegativity of titanium, Ti-C bonds are polarized toward carbon. Consequently, alkyl ligands in many titanium compounds are nucleophilic. Titanium is characteristically oxophilic, which recommends the use of air-free techniques. On the other hand, high oxophilicity means that titanium alkyls are effective for abstracting or exchanging organyl ligands for oxo groups, as discussed below. Compounds Structure of (C2H5)TiCl3(dmpe), highlighting an agostic interaction between the methyl group and the Ti(IV) center. =Alkyl titanium chlorides and alkoxides= Simple alkyl complexes of titanium, e.g. Ti(CH2C6H5)4, are rare. Several mixed alkyl-titanium-halides and alkyl-titanium-alkoxides are utilized in organic synthesis, even if they are not often well characterized.Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. At least from the commercial perspective, the most useful organotitanium compounds are generated by combining titanium(III) chloride and diethylaluminium chloride. As Ziegler–Natta catalysts, such species efficiently catalyze the polymerization of ethylene. The process is heterogeneous and no organotitanium intermediates have been well characterized for this process. Numerous organotitanium reagents are produced by combining titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetraalkoxides, or mixtures thereof with organolithium, organomagnesium, and organozinc compounds. Such compounds find occasional use as stoichiometric reagents in organic synthesis. \\"Methyltitanium trichloride\\", nominally CH3TiCl3, can be prepared by treating titanium(IV) chloride with dimethylzinc in dichloromethane at -78 °C. It delivers a methyl groups to carbonyl compounds and alkyl halides. \\"Methyltriisopropoxytitanium\\" is a related reagent. A dialkyltitanium species is implicated for Ti-promoted cyclopropanations starting from a Grignard reagent and an ester. This reaction is the basis of the Kulinkovich reaction: Kulinkovich reaction \\"Lombardo's reagent\\" is used for methylenation.. It is functionally related to the Dibromomethane-Zinc-Titanium(IV) Chloride reagent. This chemistry addresses a shortcoming of the Wittig reagent by methylenating enolisable carbonyl groups without loss of stereochemical integrity (Lombardo Methylenation). It can for example also be applied in a conversion of a ketene into an allene: :Reaction of the Lombardo reagent. =Titanocene derivatives= The structure of \\"titanocene\\" is not Ti(C5H5)2, but a fulvalene complex Attempted synthesis of \\"titanocene\\", i.e. Ti(C5H5)2, produces a fulvalene complex. The titanocene dimer was recognised in the 1970s but not structurally characterised until 1992, and the investigations led to many innovations on cyclopentadienyl complexes of titanium. Only in 1998 was a true titanocene derivative identified, the paramagnetic species (C5Me4SiMe3)2Ti. In contrast to titanocene itself, titanocene dichloride and to some extent titanocene monochloride have rich and well defined chemistries. Tebbe's reagent, prepared from titanocene dichloride and trimethylaluminium, is used as a methylenation agent (conversion of R2C=O to R2C=CH2). center Tebbe's reagent adds simple alkenes to give titanocyclobutanes, which can be regarded as stable olefin metathesis intermediates. These compounds are reagents in itself such as 1,1-bis(cyclopentadienyl)-3,3-dimethyltitanocyclobutane, the adduct of Tebbe's reagent with isobutene catalysed with 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The Petasis reagent, [(η5-Cp)2Ti(CH3)2] The Petasis reagent or dimethyl titanocene (1990) is prepared from titanocene dichloride and methyllithium in diethyl ether. Compared to Tebbe's reagent it is easier to prepare and easier to handle. It is also a methylenation reagent. The Nugent-RajanBabu reagent This review article was corrected to refer to the \\"Nugent–RajanBabu Reagent\\" rather than the \\"Nugent Reagent\\" by: is a one-electron reductant used in synthetic organic chemistry for the generation of alcohols via anti-Markovnikov ring-opening of epoxides, and is generated as a dimer [(η5-Cp)2Ti(μ-Cl)]2 and used in situ from titanocene dichloride. 600px =MonoCp compounds= Less useful in organic chemistry but still prominent are many derivatives of (cyclopentadienyl)titanium trichloride, (C5H5)TiCl3. This piano-stool complex is obtained by the redistribution reaction of titanocene dichloride and titanium tetrachloride. With an electron count of 12, it is far more electrophilic than the 16e titanocene dichloride. =Arene complexes= Titanium tetrachloride reacts with hexamethylbenzene to give [(η6-C6Me6)TiCl3]+ salts. Reduced arene complexes include the oxidation states −1, 0, +1. =Carbonyl complexes= Salts of [Ti(CO)6]2− is known.

Twice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, he served as the 6th President of Poland within the 2nd Polish Government in Exile.  Life and career  August Zaleski was born in Warsaw on 13 September 1883. In 1901 he graduated from a gymnasium in Praga and became a librarian for the Krasiński family, but finally moved to London, where he received a master's degree from the London School of Economics. He was unable to return to Poland during World War I and, in 1917, started lecturing in the Polish language in London. About that time he also became interested in freemasonry and became one of the collaborators of the Polish National Committee, the institution that was to become the Polish representative to the Triple Entente. As such, he was one of Roman Dmowski's envoys to assure English politicians that Józef Piłsudski's Polish Legions had sided with the Central Powers in order to combat Russia, not the West. In 1918, when Poland regained her independence, Zaleski proved to be a skilled diplomat and served at various posts in Polish embassies in Switzerland, Greece, Italy and was one of the Polish envoys to the League of Nations. After the May Coup d'État of 1926 he sided with the camp of Marshal Józef Piłsudski and, until 1932, held the post of minister of foreign affairs in two subsequent governments. In June 1932, Zaleski was visiting a session of the League of Nations in Geneva when found he thrust into the middle a crisis in Danzig when he learned that the destroyer ORP Wicher had been sent into the harbour of the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland) without the permission of the Senate of the Free City. Through Zaleski had not been informed that the Wicher was going to Danzig, he put up an able defense of Poland at the League Assembly and Council. In talks with the Secretary-General Sir Eric Drummond, Zaleski offered the promise that Poland would not send the Wicher back to Danzig at a time when the German battleship Schlesien was scheduled to visit, a confrontation that would potentially cause a German- Polish war in exchange for which Zaleski wanted the League to pressure the Free City to resolve the port d'attache issue governing the right of the Polish Navy to use Danzig harbour resolved in a manner satisfactory to Poland. Zaleski's offer was taken and Drummond successfully pressured the Free City into settling the port d'attache issue in a manner favorable to Poland. Between 1928 and 1935, Zaleski was also a member of the Senate of Poland. At the end of his term, he retired from active politics and became chairman of Bank Handlowy (Commercial Bank), one of the best-known Polish banks of the time. He held that post until the invasion of Poland (1939), when he successfully evacuated his company's assets first to France and then the United Kingdom. In exile, August Zaleski yet again became minister of foreign affairs, this time in the government of General Władysław Sikorski. In June 1947, Zaleski was nominated president of Polish government in exile. Initially supported by much of the Polish diaspora (Polonia), he nominated General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski to be prime minister. However, by the end of his seven- year term, Zaleski was facing opposition and was at odds with much of the political elite. His response was to extend his term and nominate Stanisław Cat-Mackiewicz to be prime minister. Many Poles in exile (Bór-Komorowski and Władysław Anders amongst them) considered this unlawful and therefore created the Council of the Three, a collective head of state that was to take over the role of the president of Poland until Zaleski properly resigned his post. However, in fact for almost twenty years the Council and Zaleski claimed the position simultaneously. August Zaleski died in London on 7 April 1972. Among his papers, two conflicting nominations of his successor were found: one naming Stanisław Ostrowski and the other one, perhaps forged, naming Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki. The Council of the Three accepted the former and disbanded.

It was committed to the development of new works and adaptations that spoke to the human condition through fantasy and mythic storytelling. Founded in the early 1990s, the theater established its reputation for unique theater at a small black-box space in a warehouse in the Lake Union/Cascade neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. Throughout their seasons, Open Circle's resident company united with local directors, musicians, visual artists and performers, to bring fresh insight and invention to their creations of highly physical, ensemble-style theater. One of their popular events was the annual adaptation and production of the works of H. P. Lovecraft for the stage, which reflected their experiments with new and adapted work. In 2008, due to development in the South Lake Union area where the new campus of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was set be constructed, the building Open Circle Theater had called home for ten years was torn down. After a year being itinerant, the company relocated to a space on the second floor of a building in the thriving neighborhood of Belltown, Seattle very close to downtown. The space opened in October, 2008 with their all new adaptation based on H.P. Lovecraft's works called The Necronomicon. The company shared the floor with the theater school Freehold. Despite recent artistic and business management changes and a string of successful shows, the company was unable to maintain financial viability and officially closed in October 2011.

From 1985 to 2019 the duo consisted of brothers Umakant Gundecha and Ramakant Gundecha and were awarded the Padma Shri for art for 2012. Following the death of Ramakant Gundecha in 2019, his son Anant began to perform with Umakant in the Gundecha bandhu. Early life and background They studied at the local Madhav Music College. Umakant has a post-graduate degree in music and economics and the younger Ramakant in music and commerce. They moved to Bhopal in 1981 for training in Dhrupad music under Zia Fariduddin Dagar and his brother Zia Mohiuddin Dagar. Both gurus were second cousins of the two major Dhrupad forces in the second half of the 20th Century; two duos known as the senior Dagar Brothers (Nasir Moinuddin & Nasir Aminuddin) and the junior Dagar Brothers (Nasir Zahiruddin & Nasir Faiyazuddin) respectively. Ramakant Gundecha died in Bhopal on 8 November 2019 from a heart attack at the age of 57 and is survived by his wife and son. He was cremated on 9 November 2019 in Bhopal. Career Ramakant Gundecha (2012) After training for four years, they performed in public for the first time in May 1985, at the Uttaradhikar dance and music festival in Bhopal. They have worked to expand the dhrupad repertoire by incorporating texts by Hindi poets such as Tulsidas, Padmakar and Nirala. The Gundecha Brothers also sing the Dhrupad compositions of India's senior Kathak exponent Mahamahopadhyay Dr. Pandit Puru Dadheech, in particular, his famous Shankar Pralayankar composition. They have set up a Dhrupad institute outside Bhopal where they teach students from all over the world. They run a music school in the Dhrupad tradition, according to the guru-shishya style of teaching that is prevalent in India for teaching of the arts. =Recordings and fellowships= Umakant Gundecha (2012).

It served in World War II with French, Japanese and other nations' forces. Other than the designer company and the calibre, this weapon is not related to the semi-automatic 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun; in particular, the cartridge used is different. Development After World War I the French military expressed a need for an anti-aircraft autocannon. The Hotchkiss company submitted its 25 mm design, but it was rejected as being too slow-firing, so the weapon was proposed for export instead. In 1938, as the international situation was worsening, and the favoured Schneider 37 mm autocannon was still not ready for production, the French military decided to reconsider its refusal to Hotchkiss, who had just won a contract with Romania. The export guns were held in France and impressed into domestic service. The original tripod was found to be unstable, which led to the development of a revised variant with a triangular base with a two- wheel carriage. This new variant was chosen for mass production, but at the time of the German attack in May 1940, only a few hundred of these guns were in service. With them and only approximately two hundred Oerlikons, the lack of modern light AA guns greatly hampered the French army in the campaign. Foreign use Romania ordered 300 pieces but only 72 had been delivered by the fall of France.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941–1945, p. 29 Japan bought a licence to manufacture the weapon, which became the Type 96 and was used on most Japanese warships of World War II as the Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun. The Spanish Republic bought the weapons for its Navy in December 1935. Five were received in January 1936 and installed during the Spanish Civil War in the destroyers Jose Luis Díez, Lepanto and Ulloa.

Adobe has described it as being \\"in the spirit of SoundEdit 16 and Cool Edit 2000\\". Adobe also has a more powerful program called Adobe Audition, which replaced Soundbooth as of Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Production Premium. Soundbooth, discontinued in 2011, was aimed at creative professionals who do not specialize in audio or people who need a simple editing program and do not require the full features of Adobe Audition. Due to Intel-specific code, Adobe stated that the Mac OS X version would only be available for machines using Intel processors. Soundbooth CS4 was the first version to support 64-bit officially. Key features Creation of the Adobe Sound Document allows Adobe Flash to create multi-track audio projects in Soundbooth.Lawson, \\"Announcing Soundbooth CS4: Now in Web Premium and Production Premium CS4.\\" Inside Sound 23 September 2008 8 October 2008 Soundbooth also features dynamic linking that allows video sequences from Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro to be played in Soundbooth without having to first be rendered, a feature that is expected to save users time. Comparing Soundbooth to Audition The major difference between the programs is that Soundbooth uses a task-based interface and Adobe Audition uses a tool-based interface. Another difference is that Soundbooth uses royalty-free scores and sound effects whereas Adobe Audition uses music loops and allows for low latency multi-track recording. Criticism Bashar And Rita users have commented on the lack of simple features that were found in programs like Sound Edit 16 and Cool Edit Pro; for example, the ability to create a new file or to \\"reverse\\" a sound. Lack of simple batch processing makes it a chore when needing to simply speed up, clean up (pops or crackles), or apply a pitch change to all of the files in a project. Each chapter, track, or MP3 file must be opened, applied, and saved independently; contrary to customer expectations of features that freeware has provided for many years. In response, Durin Gleaves (of Adobe) in a post dated 31 March 2007 said, \\"I agree that Reverse would be an obvious feature, but I'm afraid it's not going to make it into version 1.0 [CS3]. I assure you that several of us are pushing to see it in 2.0 [CS4].\\" Creating a new file was added in CS4. While the feature to \\"reverse\\" a sound was never implemented after its discontinuation. Discontinuation Adobe stated on its website that: \\"Sales of Adobe Soundbooth audio software ended on April 24, 2011. Adobe Audition CS5.5 is replacing Soundbooth in Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Production Premium software, based on customer requests for a professional audio toolset that integrates with the Adobe workflow. This decision brings the best features from the Adobe family of audio solutions into a single cross-platform package, focusing on the need for high-performance audio in post-production workflows. By combining the power and precise control Adobe Audition users have long appreciated with the more modern interface and streamlined workflow Soundbooth users value, Adobe Audition CS5.5 offers the flexibility and quality of a full-featured audio tool designed for speed and efficiency on both Mac OS and Windows.\\" References External links * Adobe - Soundbooth * Adobe Labs - Soundbooth Soundbooth Soundbooth Category:Audio editors Category:Discontinued Adobe software sr:Adobe Systems ","title":"Adobe Soundbooth"},{"id":"7654820","text":"Myrmecophilous aphids being tended by ants Myrmecophily ( ; literally \\"ant- love\\") is the term applied to positive interspecies associations between ants and a variety of other organisms such as plants, other arthropods, and fungi. Myrmecophily refers to mutualistic associations with ants, though in its more general use the term may also refer to commensal or even parasitic interactions. The term myrmecophile is used mainly for animals that associate with ants. There are an estimated 10,000 species of ants (Formicidae), with a higher diversity in the tropics.B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, The Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1990. In most terrestrial ecosystems ants are ecologically and numerically dominant, being the main invertebrate predators. As a result, ants play a key role in controlling arthropod richness, abundance, and community structure.K. Fiedler, B. Holldobler, and P. Seufert, \\"Butterflies and ants: The communicative domain,\\" Cellular and molecular life sciences, vol. 52, 1996, pp. 14-24. There is evidence that the evolution of myrmecophilous interactions has contributed to the abundance and ecological success of ants,B. Holldobler and E.O. Wilson, Journey to the Ants, Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1994. by ensuring a dependable and energy-rich food supply and thus providing a competitive advantage for ants over other invertebrate predators.N. Bluthgen, N.E. Stork, and K. Fiedler, \\"Bottom-up control and co- occurrence in complex communities: honeydew and nectar determine a rainforest ant mosaic,\\" Oikos, vol. 106, 2004, pp. 344-358. Most myrmecophilous associations are opportunistic, unspecialized, and facultative (meaning both species are capable of surviving without the interaction), though obligate mutualisms (those in which one or both species are dependent on the interaction for survival) have also been observed for many species.B. Stadler and T. Dixon, Mutualism: Ants and their insect partners, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008. As ant nests grow, they are more likely to house more and greater varieties of myrmecophiles. This is partly because larger colonies have greater specializations and therefore more diversity of ecological within the nests, allowing for there to be more diversity and population sizes among the myrmecophiles. Myrmecophile A myrmecophile is an organism that lives in association with ants. Myrmecophiles may have various roles in their host ant colony. Many consume waste materials in the nests, such as dead ants, dead larvae, or fungi growing in the nest. Some myrmecophiles, however, feed on the stored food supplies of ants, and a few are predatory on ant eggs, larvae, or pupae. Others benefit the ants by providing a food source for them. Most associations are facultative, benefiting one or both participants but not being necessary to their survival, but many myrmecophilous relationships are obligate, meaning one or the other participant requires the relationship for survival. Myrmecophilous associations are best known in butterflies of the family Lycaenidae. Many lycaenid caterpillars produce nectar by specialized organs and communicate with the ants through sound and vibrations.Pierce NE, Braby MF, Heath A, Lohman DJ, Mathew J, Rand DB, Travassos MA. 2002. The ecology and evolution of ant association in the Lycaenidae (Lepidoptera.) Annual Review of Entomology 47: 733-771. PDF The association with ants is believed to reduce the parasitisation of the butterfly caterpillars. There are myrmecophilous beetles in the families Coccinellidae (e.g. the ladybird Thalassa saginata), Aphodiidae, Scarabaeidae, Lucanidae, Cholevidae, Pselaphidae, Staphylinidae, Histeridae and Ptiliidae (some treated here as subfamilies). In ant-beetle associations, the myrmecophilous Staphylinids are the most diverse of the beetle families.Lapeva-Gjonova, Albena (April 2013). “Ant-Associated Beetle Fauna in Bulgaria: A Review and New Data”. Psyche (Cairo: Hindawi Pub. Co.) 2013: 1-14 Myrmecophilous associations are also seen in various other insects such as aphids and treehoppers, as well as the hoverfly genus Microdon and several other groups of flies. Ant nests provide environmentally stable environments that are well organized and protected by the host colony. The benefit of ant colonies has resulted in infiltration from a variety of myrmecophiles. The ant guests can have a positive, neutral or negative effect on the colony. If the infiltrating species’ impact is too negative on the colony, they risk discovery, this usually results in relatively small populations of myrmecophiles. Some spider species will utilize traits such as myrmecomorphy – ant mimicry and chemical mimicry to infiltrate ant nests, usually to prey on food supplies or the ants themselves. Aribates javensis a species of oribatid mites are obligate myrmecophiles that live in ant nests. These mites are cared for by their ant hosts in exchange for eating litter and bacteria in the nest. Other myrmecophile groups include * Orthoptera, like the cricket Myrmecophilus acervorum * Diptera, like the stratiomyid fly Clitellaria obtusa * Molluscs, like Allopeas myrmekophilos The first major work in cataloguing British myrmecophiles was done by Horace Donisthorpe in his 1927 book The Guests of British Ants. Ant-plant interactions Ant-plant interactions are geographically widespread,V. Rico- Gray and P. Oliveira, The Ecology and Evolution of Ant-Plant Interactions, Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2007. with hundreds of species of myrmecophytic plants in several families including the Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, and Orchidaceae. In general, myrmecophytes (or ant plants) usually provide some form of shelter and food in exchange for ant \\"tending,\\" which may include protection, seed dispersal (see myrmecochory), reduced competition from other plants, hygienic services, and/or nutrient supplementation.M. Heil and D. McKey, \\"Protective ant-plant interactions as model systems in ecological and evolutionary research,\\" Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, vol. 34, 2003, pp. 425-453. Three of the most common and important structural adaptations of ant plants are extrafloral nectaries, domatia, and (least commonly) Beltian bodies. Plant domatia are pre-formed nesting sites provided by the plant in the form of hollow stems, petioles, thorns, or curled leaves. The production of ant-specialized domatia has been documented in over 100 genera of tropical plants. Beltian bodies provide a high-energy food source to ants in the form of nutritive corpuscles produced on leaflet tips, and they have been described in at least 20 plant families. Extrafloral nectaries (EFN's) are known to occur in at least 66 families of angiosperm plants in both temperate and tropical regions, as well as some ferns, but are absent in all gymnosperms and are most abundant in the tropics. EFN's being outside of the plant flowers are not employed in pollination; their primary purpose is to attract and sustain tending ants. Many plants can control the flow of nectar from the EFN's so that the availability of nectar varies according to daily and seasonal cycles. Because ants can respond quickly to changes in flow rate from EFN's, this may be possible mechanism by which plants can induce greater ant activity during times of peak herbivory and minimize overall costs of nectar production. The combined nutritional output of EFN's and Beltian bodies can be a significant food source for tending ants, and in some cases can provide the total nutritive needs for an ant colony. In exchange for nesting sites and food resources, ants protect plants from herbivores. One the best-known examples of ant-plant mutualism is in bullhorn acacias (Acacia cornigera) and their tending Pseudomyrmex ants in Central America. This system was studied by Daniel Janzen in the late 1960s, who provided some of the first experimental evidence that ants significantly reduce herbivory rates of myrmecophytes.D. Janzen, \\"Coevolution of mutualism between ants and acacias in Central America,\\" Evolution, vol. 20, 1966, pp. 249-275.D. Janzen, \\"Interaction of the bull's-horn acacia (Acacia cornigera L. ) with an ant inhabitant (Pseudomyrmex ferruginea F. Smith) in Eastern Mexico,\\" Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull. , vol. 47, 1967, pp. 315-558. Since then many other studies have demonstrated similar results in other systems. In the Bullhorn acacia system, in exchange for protection the acacias provide domatia, Beltian bodies, and EFN's, and there is evidence that the Pseudomyrmex ants can survive exclusively on these food resources without having to forage elsewhere. For many plants, including the bullhorn acacias, ants can significantly reduce herbivory from both phytophagous insects as well as larger organisms, such as large grazing mammals. Obligately associated ant species are some of most aggressive ants in the world, and can defend a plant against herbivory by large mammals by repeatedly biting their attacker and spraying formic acid into the wound. Myrmecophily is considered a form of indirect plant defense against herbivory, though ants often provide other services in addition to protection. Some ants provide hygienic services to keep leaf surfaces clean and deter disease, and defense against fungal pathogens has also been demonstrated. It is common for ants to prune epiphytes, vines, and parasitic plants from their host plant, and they sometimes thin the shoots of neighboring plants as well. In doing so, ants reduce plant-plant competition for space, light, nutrients, and water. Finally, current work focusing on ants' role in nutrient supplementation for plants has shown that in many ant-plant relationships nutrient flow is bidirectional. One study has estimated that while 80% of the carbon in the bodies of Azteca spp. workers is supplied by the host tree (Cecropia spp.), 90% of the Cecropia tree's nitrogen was supplied by ant debris carried to the tree as a result of external foraging.G. Alvarez, I. Armbrecht, E. Jimenez, H. Armbrecht, and P. Ulloa-Chacon, \\"Ant-plant Association in Two Tococa Species From a Primary Rain Forest of Colombian Choco (Hymenoptera: Formicidae),\\" Sociobiology, vol. 38, 2001, pp. 558-602. In light of these services, myrmecophily has been considered advantageous in ensuring a plant's survival and ecological success, although the costs to the plant of providing for the ants can sufficiently high to offsets benefits.  Ant-arthropod interactions  Many species of arthropods are dependent on ant species and live amongst them in their nests. Mites are particularly apt at being myrmecophiles, being that they are small enough to enter nests easily and to not be evicted from the homes and bodies of ants. In fact, there have been multiple studies showing mites extreme myrmecophily to numbers far above other myrmecophiles. Ant-insect interactions Ants tend a wide variety of insect species, most notably lycaenid butterfly caterpillars and hemipterans. Forty-one percent of all ant genera include species that associate with insects.T.H. Oliver, S.R. Leather, and J.M. Cook, \\"Macroevolutionary patterns in the origin of mutualisms involving ants,\\" Journal of Evolutionary Biology, vol. 21, Nov. 2008, pp. 1597-1608. These types of ant-insect interactions involve the ant providing some service in exchange for nutrients in the form of honeydew, a sugary fluid excreted by many phytophagous insects. . Interactions between honeydew-producing insects and ants is often called trophobiosis, a term which merges notions of trophic relationships with symbioses between ants and insects. This term has been criticized, however, on the basis that myrmecophilous interactions are often more complex than simple trophic interactions, and the use of symbiosis is inappropriate for describing interactions among free-living organisms. Insects may also form adaptations to contend with ant aggression, resulting in either mutualistic or parasitic bonds with ant colonies. Some beetles from the family Coccinellidae have developed behaviors, body shapes, and chemical mimicry in order to prey on ant-tended aphids. =Hemiptera= Ant obtaining honeydew from an aphid A leaf-hopper nymph tended by an ant Some of the most well-studied myrmecophilous interactions involve ants and hemipterans (earlier grouped in the order Homoptera which included the Auchenorrhyncha and Sternorrhyncha), especially aphids. There are around 4000 described species of aphids, and they are the most abundant myrmecophilous organisms in the northern temperate zones. Aphids feed on the phloem sap of plants, and as they feed they excrete honeydew droplets from their anus. The tending ants ingest these honeydew droplets then return to their nest to regurgitate the fluid for their nestmates (see trophallaxis). Between 90 and 95% of the dry weight of aphid honeydew is various sugars, while the remaining matter includes vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Aphid honeydew can provide an abundant food source for ants (aphids in the genus Tuberolachnus can secrete more honeydew droplets per hour than their body weight) and for some ants aphids may be their only source of food. In these circumstances, ants may supplement their honeydew intake by preying on the aphids once the aphid populations have reached certain densities. In this way ants can gain extra protein and ensure efficient resource extraction by maintaining honeydew flow rates that do not exceed the ants' collection capabilities. Even with some predation by ants, aphid colonies can reach larger densities with tending ants than colonies without. Ants have been observed to tend large \\"herds\\" of aphids, protecting them from predators and parasitoids. Aphid species that are associated with ants often have reduced structural and behavioral defense mechanisms, and are less able to defend themselves from attack than aphid species that are not associated with ants. Ants engage in associations with other honeydew- producing hemipterans such as scale insects (Coccidae), mealybugs (Pseudococcidae), and treehoppers (Membracidae), and most of these interaction are facultative and opportunistic with some cases of obligate associations, such as hemipterans that are inquiline, meaning they can only survive inside ant nests. In addition to protection, ants may provide other services in exchange for hemipteran honeydew. Some ants bring hemipteran larvae into the ant nests and rear them along with their own ant brood. Additionally, ants may actively aid in hemipteran dispersal: queen ants have been observed transporting aphids during their dispersive flights to establish a new colony, and worker ants will often carry aphids to a new nesting site if the previous ant nest has been disturbed. Ants may also carry hemipterans to different parts of a plant or to different plants in order to ensure a fresh food source and/or adequate protection for the herd. =Lycaenid butterflies= Ant tending a Lycaenid caterpillar Loxura atymnus is famous for consuming nectar secreted from the extrafloral nectaries stimulated by the ants. Here they are on a Philippine orchid bud along with some yellow crazy ants. Myrmecophily among lycaenid caterpillars differs from the associations of hemipterans because caterpillars feed on plant tissues, not phloem sap, and therefore do not continually excrete honeydew. Caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies have therefore evolved specialized organs that secrete chemicals to feed and appease ants. The secretions are a mixture of sugar and amino acid which in synergy is more attractive to the ants than either component in its own. The secretions of Narathura japonica caterpillars are thought to be more than merely providing nutrition, with components that cause behavior alteration in the ants, with a reduction in the locomotory activity of caterpillar attendants, increased aggression and protectiveness by Pristomyrmex punctatus ants, suggesting that the association are better treated as parasitic than mutualistic. Because caterpillars do not automatically pass honeydew, they must be stimulated to secrete droplets and do so in response to ant antennation, which is the drumming or stroking of the caterpillar's body by the ants' antennae. Some caterpillars possess specialized receptors that allow them to distinguish between ant antennation and contact from predators and parasites, and others produce acoustic signals that agitate ants, making them more active and likely better defenders of the larvae.A.A. Agrawal and J.A. Fordyce, \\"Induced indirect defence in a lycaenid-ant association: the regulation of a resource in a mutualism ,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, vol. 267, 2000, pp. 1857-1861.K. Fiedler, Systematic, evolutionary, and ecological implication of myrmecophily within the Lycaenidae, UND Museum Alexander Koenig: Bonner Zoologische Monographien, 1991. As with homopteran myrmecophiles, ants protect Lycaenid larvae from predatory insects (including other ants) and parasitoid wasps, which lay their eggs in the bodies of many species of Lepidoptera larvae. For example, one study conducted by Pierce and colleagues in Colorado experimentally found that for the larvae of Glaucopsyche lygdamus that were tended by a certain ant species (Formica podzolica), compared to untended larvae, the percentage of larvae disappearing from plants before late final instar decreased (not statistically significantly, though) and the percentage of larvae infected by parasitoids significantly decreased (from 33% to 9%–12%).A.M. Fraser, A.H. Axen, and N.E. Pierce, \\"Assessing the Quality of Different Ant Species as Partners of a Myrmecophilous Butterfly,\\" Oecologia, vol. 129, Nov. 2001, pp. 452-460. These interactions do not come without an energetic cost to the butterfly, however, and it has been shown that ant-tended individuals reach smaller adult sizes than non-tended individuals due to the costs of appeasing ants during the larval stage.N.E. Pierce, M.F. Braby, A. Heath, D.J. Lohman, J. Mathew, D.B. Rand, and M.A. Travassos, \\"The ecology and evolution of ant association in the Lycaenidae (Lepidoptera),\\" Annual Review of Entomology, vol. 47, 2002, pp. 733-771. Interactions with ants are not limited to the butterfly's larval stage, and in fact ants can be important partners for butterflies at all stages of their life cycle. For example, adult females of many lycaenid butterflies, such as J. evagoras, preferentially oviposit on plants where ant partners are present, possibly by using ants' own chemical cues in order to locate sites where juvenile butterflies will likely be tended by ants. While ant attendance has been widely documented in Lycaenid butterflies and to some extent in riodinid butterflies such as E. elvina, many other lepidopteran species are known to associate with ants, including many moths. = Rove beetles = =Multiple levels of myrmecophily= Many trophobiotic ants can simultaneously maintain associations with multiple species. Ants that interact with myrmecophilous insects and myrmecophytes are highly associated: species that are adapted to interact with one of these myrmecophiles may switch among them depending on resource availability and quality. Of the ant genera that include species that associate with ant plants, 94% also include species that associate with trophobionts. In contrast, ants that are adapted to cultivate fungus (leaf cutter ants, tribe Attini) do not possess the morphological or behavioral adaptations to switch to trophobiotic partners. Many ant mutualists can exploit these multi-species interactions to maximize the benefits of myrmecophily. For example, some plants will host aphids instead of investing in EFN's, which may be more energetically costly depending on local food availability. The presence of multiple interactors can strongly influence the outcomes of myrmecophily, often in unexpected ways.J. Hoeksema and E. Bruna, \\"Pursuing the big questions about interspecific mutualism: a review of theoretical approaches,\\" Oecologia, vol. 125, 2000, pp. 321-330. Significance of myrmecophily in ecology Mutualisms are geographically ubiquitous, found in all organismic kingdoms, and play a major role in all ecosystems.M. Doebeli and N. Knowlton, \\"The evolution of interspecific mutualisms,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 95, 1998, pp. 8676-8680. Combined with the fact that ants are one of the most dominant lifeforms on earth, it is clear that myrmecophily plays a significant role in the evolution and ecology of diverse organisms, and in the community structure of many terrestrial ecosystems. =Evolution of positive interactions= Questions of how and why species coevolve are of great interest and significance. In many myrmecophilous organisms it is clear that ant associations have been influential in the ecological success, diversity, and persistence of species. Analyses of phylogenetic information for myrmecophilous organisms as well as ant lineages have demonstrated that myrmecophily has arisen independently in most groups multiple times. Because there have been multiple gains (and perhaps losses) of myrmecophilous adaptations, the evolutionary sequence of events in most lineages is unknown. Exactly how these associations evolve also remains unclear. In studying the coevolution of myrmecophilous organisms, many researchers have addressed the relative costs and benefits of mutualistic interactions, which can vary drastically according to local species composition and abundance, variation in nutrient requirements and availability, host plant quality, presence of alternative food sources, abundance and composition of predator and parasitoid species, and abiotic conditions. Because of the large amounts of variation in some of these factors, the mechanisms that support the stable persistence of myrmecophily are still unknown. In many cases, variation in external factors can result in interactions that shift along a continuum of mutualism, commensalism, and even parasitism. In almost all mutualisms, the relative costs and benefits of interactions are asymmetrical; that is, one partner experiences greater benefits and/or fewer costs than the other partner. This asymmetry leads to \\"cheating,\\" in which one partner evolves strategies to receive benefits without providing services in return. As with many other mutualisms, cheating has evolved in interactions between ants and their partners. For example, some lycaenid larvae are taken into ant nests where they prey on ant brood and offer no services to the ants. Other lycaenids may parasitize ant-plant relationships by feeding on plants that are tended by ants, apparently immune to ant attack because of their own appeasing secretions. Hemipterophagous lycaenids engage in a similar form of parasitism in ant-hemipteran associations. In light of the variability in outcomes of mutualistic interactions, and also the evolution of cheating in many systems, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms that maintain mutualism as an evolutionarily stable interaction. =Species coexistence= In addition to leading to coevolution, mutualisms also play an important role in structuring communities. One of the most obvious ways in which myrmecophily influences community structure is by allowing for the coexistence of species which might otherwise be antagonists or competitors. For many myrmecophiles, engaging in ant associations is first and foremost a method of avoiding predation by ants. For example, the caterpillars of lycaenid butterflies are an ideal source of food for ants: they are slow-moving, soft-bodied, and highly nutritious, yet they have evolved complex structures to not only appease ant aggression but to elicit protective services from the ants. In order to explain why ants cooperate with other species as opposed to preying on them, two related hypotheses have been proposed: cooperation either provides ants with resources that are otherwise difficult to find, or it ensures the long-term availability of those resources. =Community structure= At both small and large spatiotemporal scales, mutualistic interactions influence patterns of species richness, distribution, and abundance.J.J. Stachowicz, \\"Mutualism, Facilitation, and the Structure of Ecological Communities,\\" BioScience, vol. 51, Mar. 2001, pp. 235-246. Myrmecophilous interactions play an important role in determining community structure by influencing inter- and intraspecific competition; regulating population densities of arthropods, fungi, and plants; determining arthropod species assemblages; and influencing trophic dynamics. Recent work in tropical forests has shown that ant mutualisms may play key roles in structuring food webs, as ants can control entire communities of arthropods in forest canopies. Myrmecophily has also been key in the ecological success of ants. Ant biomass and abundance in many ecosystems exceeds that of their potential prey, suggesting a strong role of myrmecophily in supporting larger populations of ants than would otherwise be possible. Furthermore, by providing associational refugia and habitat amelioration for many species, ants are considered dominant ecosystem engineers. =Myrmecophily as a model system= Myrmecophilous interactions provide an important model system for exploring ecological and evolutionary questions regarding coevolution, plant defense theory, food web structure, species coexistence, and evolutionarily stable strategies. Because many myrmecophilous relationships are easily manipulable and tractable, they allow for testing and experimentation that may not be possible in other interactions. Therefore, they provide ideal model systems in which to explore the magnitude, dynamics, and frequency of mutualism in nature.

He coached the 507th PIR football team, leading them through a ten-game season in which the 507th was never defeated and never even scored upon. =College coaching= After returning home, Schwartzwalder began his college coaching career at Muhlenberg College, where he went 25-5. He coached at Syracuse from 1949 to 1973, compiling a 178–96–3 record, and winning one national championship in 1959 while going undefeated with an 11–0 record. The 1959 team was an unprecedented powerhouse with both the toughest offense (313.6 yards rushing, 451.5 yard total and 39 points per game on average) and the toughest defense (giving only 19.3 yards rushing, 96.2 yards total per game on average) in the country. This remains Syracuse's only football national championship to date. Schwartzwalder's teams went to seven bowl games and won four Lambert Trophies. In 1959, he also won the national coach of the year award. During his 25 years as head coach Syracuse teams outrushed their opponents by more than 22,000 yards. Schwartzwalder had a knack for developing excellent running backs through their college careers, including Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis, Jim Brown, Floyd Little, Jim Nance, and Larry Csonka. Schwartzwalder had a significant history of recruiting and developing black players during the 1950s and 1960s when many other major programs refused to do so. He coached the first African-American to win a Heisman Trophy and maintained team unity and cohesiveness in a racially charged environment to defeat the all- white Texas Longhorns in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic and win a national championship. =Personal life= In 1973, Schwartzwalder retired from coaching and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida. Following his death in 1993, Schwartzwalder was survived by his daughters, Susan Walker and Mary Scofield. His wife Ruth \\"Reggie\\" Schwartzwalder died on August 25, 2012, aged 100. He is buried in the Onondaga County Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Syracuse, NY. Legacy In 1967, Schwartzwalder was elected president of the American Football Coaches Association. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. The coach is also remembered through the Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy which, goes to the winner of each game between West Virginia University (where he had played as a college student) and Syracuse University. The trophy was established in 1993, the year Schwartzwalder died, and was sculpted by Syracuse sports hall-of-famer Jim Ridlon. =The Express= Schwartzwalder is portrayed by actor Dennis Quaid in the 2008 Universal Pictures film The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, a biographical film about Syracuse University Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis.

They had their breakthrough in 2004 with the release of their second album USADSB. The release coincided with lead singer Simon Kvamm's appearances on Danish television in the comedy show Drengene fra Angora, which helped boost the band's popularity. The band uses a mixture of Danish and English in their lyrics; they started singing mostly in English with just a few Danish lyrics but, gradually, they have been using Danish more frequently in their songs. In 2009, when interviewed and asked about the language mix, frontman Kvamm said: \\"It's important for me to use the Danish kind of English that I speak...my mother tongue Danish, and my second language English, are very present to me in thinking and talking and speaking with others, and writing. Also in songwriting. And things just take form in one of those languages, or a mixture in between them. I can't really find a system to what goes the English way and what goes the Danish.\\" The band considers Depeche Mode as one of its major influences. Around 2004-2005, a mix of Nephew's \\"Movie Klip\\" and Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus\\" appeared. It was later revealed that the mix was made by René Munk Thalund. History =Early Days and Swimming Time (1996-2004)= The band was formed in 1996 by Simon Kvamm, Kristian Riis, Jonas Juul Jeppesen, and Søren Arnholt, all of whom were studying musicology at the university of Aarhus. In 1997 they participated in DM i Rock (Danish Championships in Rock), where they reached the semi-finals. In 1998 Jonas Juul Jeppesen, who was until then the bassist in the band, left the band, and was replaced by the current bassist Kasper Toustrup. After recording their first demo CDs in 1998 and 1999, they got some airtime on the Danish radio station P3. The band's first studio album, Swimming Time, was released on 3 May 2000, on the small label Martian Records. The album was well received by both critics and fans, peaking at #15 on the charts for 1 week. The band's gig calendar became even busier than it already was, and the band performed both on Camp Stage at Roskilde Festival and a couple of venues in Germany. In spite of the band's success, the band members lost their enthusiasm and decided to take a break in 2001 but, during their farewell concert in Germany, they rediscovered their passion for music and decided to stay together. =USADSB and Breakthrough (2004-06)= Nephew's second studio album, named USADSB, was released 30 June 2004. The name comes from the abbreviation for the United States of America, USA, and the abbreviation for the Danske Statsbaner (Danish State Railways), DSB. It was very well received and is seen as their \\"breakthrough\\" album in Denmark and elsewhere. While the success of the album was propelled by Simon Kvamm's participation in the Danish satire show Drengene Fra Angora, which helped make his a household name, the album's first single Movie Klip became a radio hit in December 2003 well before the premiere of Drengene From Angora.http://andyg.dk/p3trends/unavoidables USADSB sold far more copies than Swimming Time, going four times platinum in Denmark and spawning six hit singles. It peaked at #1 and held that position for 7 weeks. The anthem for the fictional cycling team Team Easy On from the show even came second after one of the singles from USADSB, \\"En Wannabe Darth Vader\\", which topped the Danish singles chart. Aside from Denmark, USADSB has been released in Japan, Germany and Norway. In 2005, René Munk Thalund officially joined Nephew as keyboardist after having toured with the band since April 2004. He had previously been in the electronic trio Shanks.dk with Nephew's producer, Carsten Heller, and Jesper Birk. With this new member, Nephew proceeded to make the song \\"Byens Hotel\\" for Værsgo 2, the 2005 Danish tribute album to Kim Larsen's 1973 album Værsgo. =Interkom Kom Ind (2006-09)= On 6 October 2006, Nephew released a new album, Interkom Kom Ind, which received many positive reviews, and fared well commercially both in Denmark and other countries in Europe. The singles, \\"Igen & Igen &\\", \\"Science Fiction & Familien\\", and \\"Mexico Ligger i Spanien\\" rotated heavily on Danish radio. It topped the charts for 3 weeks. The Mexico Ligger i Spanien Remix EP was released later in 2007, which contains remixes by Mofus and Klovn of the song \\"Mexico Ligger i Spanien\\", as well as both an extended mix and a short intro version of the song. At the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards, the band met Timbaland, who asked them if they could work on his forthcoming Timbaland Presents Shock Value album. Due to other commitments, Nephew couldn't contribute to the album, but they did produce a remix of the song \\"The Way I Are\\". Only the vocals from the original song are the same, the Danish band having completely redone the song. Nephew frontman Simon Kvamm also delivers new vocals for the song, which were included on the single release. The remix samples the melody from \\"Igen & Igen &\\", as well as translating lyrics from the song which are then incorporated throughout the remix. It was released in most of Europe as a B-side to the original single, and in Scandinavia, was played often as the main single. On 5 November 2007, Nephew released a live- box set (Live-CD/2DVD) entitled Roskilde 07.07.07 based upon a much-acclaimed live performance at Orange Scene at the 2007 Roskilde Festival. The Live CD features songs from the albums USADSB and Interkom Kom Ind, including a special version of \\"Hospital\\" which features a guest performance by Danish rapper L.O.C.. The Special Edition of the box also includes the band's remix of the Timbaland track \\"The Way I Are\\". The album peaked at #2 for 1 week. In September 2008, a Nephew remix of the song \\"Allein Allein\\" by German band Polarkreis 18, entitled \\"Allein Alene\\", appeared in Danish radio. It was mixed by the keyboardist of the band, René Munk Thalund, and Carsten Heller, who both mixes and produces for Nephew. It topped the chart for 8 weeks. =Danmark/Denmark (2009-12)= Simon Kvamm performing at Roskilde Festival 2010 Nephew released their fourth album, Danmark/Denmark, on 5 June 2009, the Danish Constitution Day. It peaked at #1, holding the spot for 2 weeks. Following a performance at Roskilde Festival in 2010, the band announced that they would be taking a break from touring and Denmark, although they did play shows in Norway and China. On 23 November 2011 they announced via their official website that they would be playing several concerts in July 2012 as a part of the Grøn Koncerter (\\"Green Concert\\"). They also announced in the same press release that they had begun work on Hjertestarter and expected to release it sometime in the autumn of 2012. Nephew was also responsible for the official football song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa: \\"The Danish Way to Rock\\", which sat at the top of the charts for 2 weeks. In addition to this, the Police Bells & Church Sirens EP was released in 2010, containing a radio edit, a \\"Dainty Doll's Trend Mix\\", and \\"Nephew's Nightlife Mix\\" (mixed by René Munk Thalund of Nephew) of the song \\"Police Bells & Church Sirens\\". Furthermore, two of the band members, René Munk Thalund and Kristian Riis, did backing vocals for Kim Wilde's song \\"Hey! You!\\" on her album Come Out and Play. =Hjertestarter (2012-13)= Hjertestarter was released on 2 November 2012. It went straight to the number one most sold album (in Denmark) that month and the Danish iTunes store, holding the top spot on the charts for 2 weeks. Nephew has performed at various events with the single of the same name; most recently the Danish Music Awards'12. When asked what this single was meant to convey, Kristian Riis said (roughly translated from Danish): \\"The album's title track is a tribute to the North Sea. The single acts to start up the heart–emotionally or literally in a revival.\\" The third single \\"Gå med dig\\" featuring Marie Key went Gold. =1-2-3-4-5 and Igen & Igen & (2013)= On 18 November 2013, Nephew released an album boxset, 1-2-3-4-5, as well as a collection of singles, Igen & Igen &. 1-2-3-4-5 contains Nephew's five studio albums along with 15 bonus songs; early renditions of the songs \\"USADSB\\", \\"Mexico Ligger i Spanien\\", \\"Hospital\\", \\"007 Is Also Gonna Die\\", and \\"Hjertestarter\\"; a remix of \\"Downtown Europe\\" by Ørtz/Mofus; an alternative version of \\"Worst/Best Case Scenario\\"; an early version of \\"Superliga\\"; the previously unreleased demo songs \\"Swedenborg\\" and \\"Marking Princess\\"; and premixes of the previously unreleased \\"Pasfotografier\\", \\"Automatisk Mig\\", \\"Stop Nu Hjælp Nu\\", \\"The Day I Laminate My Heart\\", and \\"Jeg Kan Se\\". It peaked at #15 and stayed there for a week. Igen & Igen & is a collection of all of Nephew's singles currently released at the time, as well as one bonus track: a cover of the song \\"Det Si'r Sig Selv\\" by C.V. Jørgensen. It sat at #8 for 1 week. =Ring–i–Ring (2018)= In October 2017 Nephew announced that they would return in 2018 after four years in hiatus.https://www.bt.dk/musik/derfor-er-nephew-stadig-danmarks-stoerste-band They announced two arena shows in Jyske Bank Boxen and Royal Arena to take place a year later. The more that 30.000 tickets for the shows sold out in less than a day. They also announced Marie Højlund as a new member of the band.

The Temagami region is known as n'Daki Menan, the homeland of the area's First Nations community, most of whom are Anishinaabe (Ojibwe), living on Bear Island. The official name for this group is the Temagami First Nation. However, a larger group that includes these people, plus non-status residents and some non-residents is called the Teme-Augama Anishnabai. Some of the main tourist attractions within the community include old-growth red and white pine, Lake Temagami, Caribou Mountain, fishing, showings of Grey Owl from the 1930s, and over of canoe routes. It is also known as the staging point for cottage vacationing and wilderness canoeing trips on Lake Temagami, in Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, and vast tracts of wilderness in the area. There are several outfitters here that cater to outdoor activity. The community is home to the Finlayson Point Provincial Park, which itself offers access to Lake Temagami. An excellent view of the entire Temagami area is offered by the Temagami Fire Tower on Caribou Mountain, a renovated -tall fire lookout tower that visitors can climb for a small fee. The Temagami Fire Tower was last used in the 1970s to spot fires. The original fire tower built here was high and made of square timber. The Municipality of Temagami also includes the communities of Lake Temagami, Marten River, and Temagami North. History Anima Nipissing The Anishnabai have been living in the area for at least 6,000 years after migrating from the east coast of North America. The land was divided into familial hunting and trapping territories. Since the main east-west fur trade route bypassed Temagami to the south, settlement of this area by Europeans did not come until 1834. That year the Hudson's Bay Company built a store on Temagami Island, which later relocated to Bear Island. The town itself was founded by Dan O'Connor, who in 1903 formed the O'Connor Steamboat and Hotel Company on the lake and established its first store on the future townsite. By 1906, he had built three hotels on Lake Temagami: Hotel Ronnoco, Temagami Inn, and Lady Evelyn Hotel and by 1910 the company operated ten steamships on the lake including the Belle of Temagami. Discoveries of gold, copper, nickel, and particularly silver in 1903, brought mining to nearby Cobalt and accelerated development of the region. Several mines opened in Temagami, including Big Dan Mine, Little Dan Mine, Barton Mine, Hermiston-McCauley Mine, Temagami-Lorrain Mine, Priest Mine, Beanland Mine, Sherman Mine, Kanichee Mine, Northland Pyrite Mine and Copperfields Mine, which once mined the richest copper ore in Canada. The Forest Reserves Act of 1898 established the Temagami Forest Reserve. Because of this reserve, the region was home to the last Old-growth forests in Ontario. Logging of the vast pine stands only began in the 1920s. Now just a few patches of old growth remain, including the White Bear Forest () and the world's largest stand of old-growth red and white pine forest - the Obabika Old-Growth Forest or Wakimika Triangle Forest part of the Obabika River Waterway Provincial Park (). This has led to confrontation in recent years between loggers and environmentalists when new logging access roads are built or major logging operations are proposed. Access to many old-growth areas is provided on local hiking trails and canoe routes. The inspiration and wonder of the area were brought to millions around the world in 1907 when Grey Owl arrived in Temagami. He was employed by Keewaydin Canoe Camp as a guide, and later by the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests as a ranger. His subsequent books and extensive lecturing in Britain and the United States brought tremendous attention to northeastern Ontario and wildlife conservation. In 1968, Temagami was incorporated, first as an Improvement District, and 10 years later as a Township, consisting of the geographic townships of Strathy and Strathcona, together with parts of Briggs, Chambers, Best, Cassels, and Yates townships. In 1973, The Teme-Augama Anishnabai (TAA) exercised a land caution against development on the Crown land of , most of the Temagami area. The Attorney General of Ontario pursued legal action against the Band for this caution. The TAA lost this court case in 1984 and the Band proceeded with an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Band lost this appeal and eventually the caution was lifted. In 1988, the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources, Vince Kerrio approved the expansion of the Red Squirrel Road, directly through Anishnabe territory. This prompted a series of roadblocks by the TAA and by the Temagami Wilderness Society in 1988-1989. The Temagami First Nation's former chief Gary Potts was the leader of the TAA blockades. In 1991 the TAA and the Ontario government created the Wendaban Stewardship Authority to decide what to do with the four townships near the logging road. On January 1, 1998, the Township of Temagami was greatly enlarged through the merger with 17 unincorporated townships and became the Municipality of Temagami with town status. Transportation =Rail= Temagami - 1938 Temagami Railway Station In the summer of 1905, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now the Ontario Northland Railway) was completed from North Bay to New Liskeard and allowed direct access to the area and the Clay Belt around Lake Timiskaming, opening up the region to settlement and development. The original Temagami station, which opened in 1907, burnt down in 1909 and was rebuilt. Temagami station was a stop on the Northlander railway service before it was cancelled in 2012. =Bus= Temagami is served by Ontario Northland's intercity motor coach service along its North Bay–Hearst route, which also serves many communities along the former Northlander route. There is currently no local bus service in Temagami. Geography The Temagami land is part of the Canadian Shield, one of the largest single exposure of Precambrian rocks in the world which were formed after the Earth's crust cooled. Temagami land has striking similarities to the Sudbury Structure, which is one of the richest mining camps in the world. The hills in the Temagami area are remnants of the oldest mountain ranges in North America that date back during the Precambrian era. These enormous mountains were taller than any that exist today. The uplifting was accomplished as enormous pressure caused the earth to buckle in a process called folding. Other processes, such as volcanic activity and geologic faulting in which the earth cracks open also contributed to the formation of these mountains. Over millions of years, these enormous mountains were gradually eroded to the land we know today in Temagami. The rocks that form Temagami to this day are igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The Temagami area has good potential to host diamondiferous kimberlites and more diamond bearing kimberlites may continue to be discovered in the area. The Temagami area also contains some pillow lava about 2 billion years old, indicating that great submarine volcanoes existed during the early stages of the formation of the Earth's crust. There are a number of northwest trending faults in the Temagami East claim block area and are associated with the Saint Lawrence rift system and remains seismically active. The most recently felt earthquake in the Temagami area occurred in the year 2000. Minerals in the Temagami area include aragonite, brochantite, calcite, Chalcopyrite, jasper, magnetite, molybdenite, pentlandite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, serpentine, and talc. A bright white palladium mercury telluride mineral was discovered on Temagami Island in 1973 called temagamite, named after its discovery locality in Copperfields Mine, originally known as Temagami Mine. Temagami provides rugged topography, which is excellent for canoeing and hiking. There are numerous viewpoints in the municipality, including High Rock and Caribou Mountain, which contains a fire tower on its summit. =Lakes= Rabbit Lake Anima Nipissing Lake Lake Temagami Lakes located within the Municipality of Temagami include: *Angus Lake *Anima Nipissing Lake *Arsenic Lake *Blueberry Lake *Brophy Lake *Cassels Lake *Chambers Lake *Cross Lake *Duncan Lake *Gull Lake *Herridge Lake *Ingall Lake *James Lake *Jumping Cariboo Lake *Lake Temagami *Link Lake *Lowell Lake *Lower Redwater Lake *Lower Twin Lake *Martin Lake *Net Lake *Obabika Lake *Obashkong Lake *Poison Pond *Rabbit Lake *Rib Lake *Red Squirrel Lake *Snake Island Lake *Snowshoe Lake *Tent Lake *Tetapaga Lake *Turtle Lake *Upper Redwater Lake *Upper Twin Lake *Wasaksina Lake *Wilson Lake An aerial view of the Temagami townsite, on the banks of Lake Temagami (centre-left) and Caribou Lake (bottom).

It forms part of the Bay of Roses and, like the Ebro Delta, was a malarial swampland. The marshland lies between the Rivers Fluvià and Muga. It is the second largest wetland in Catalonia at over 4,800 hectares and was established in 1983. \\\\- During the 19th century, much of the marsh was drained as canals were created and the land converted to agriculture. However, virgin marsh and dunes remained and was given Natural Park status in the 1980s after a campaign to save the area from development. The park accommodates 327 different species. Great spotted cuckoo, spoonbill, nightingale, collared pratincole and stone- curlew are among its many birds. The park offers seven hides and one tower for bird watchers. They are connected through a plain dirt track which allows wheelchairs.

In 1997, it moved to Concord, Ontario. They went out of business in mid 1999. Playtoy both developed its own games, and licensed from others. Most often, they licensed from Pressman Toy Corporation. Playtoy Industries would then translate the product into French in order to ship a bilingual product. Playtoy introduced three new Canadian games each year. They licensed some of these to Pressman Toy Corporation, as in the case of IQ2000. The company also distributed a range of games in Canada for the Sega Genesis. Games were manufactured both locally at their combined offices/factory and overseas. The most notable exceptions were hoolahoops and some other plastic products which were assembled by ARC Industries (a sheltered workshop for adults with a developmental disability). Playtoy also manufactured games based on TV game shows, such as La Guerre des clans from TQS, and other shows from CBC Television and some other Canadian channels. They were Johnson & Johnson's infant toys distributor in Canada (and responsible for the French translation). Playtoy's mass manufactured Co-Operative Game line was licensed from Jim Deacove (Family Pastimes), who continued to manufacture the same games in small batches.

Background The firm dates back to the 1960s and peaked during the 1990s. The City Psychos evolved from the original Hull skinhead gangs and the Kempton Fusiliers who were named after the east side railway stand at Boothferry Park. They were well known as tough representatives of Kingston upon Hull, a big tough working class port city. It was not unusual for the City Psychos to number over half Hull City’s away support during the years in the lower leagues at the end of the 1970s and start of the 1980s. They were famous for travelling to away games on Hull Corporation double decker buses. From 1979 the more traditional scarfer element of support became known as the normals whilst these equally loyal supporters evolved in to City’s casual mob and were some of the earliest casual boys seen in Yorkshire outside the North West and won respect for their fierce rivalry with Sheffield United, Middlesbrough and York City. Today The mob is now known as The Minority and the youth firm are known as the Young City Casuals or 'YCC' along with the even younger group known as the 'Under 5's'.

He is an outspoken critic of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Biography He was one of the thirteen initiators of the re-establishment of the Democratic Party in Serbia on 11 December 1989. He was one of the leading members of the Founding Committee of the Democratic Party who drafted the first party political program of the Democratic Party published as the Letter of Intent (Pismo o namerama) on 18 January 1990. However, within a year he left the Democratic Party along with Professor Nikola Milošević and others to found his own political entity, the Serbian Liberal Party. Kosta Čavoški had been a dissident since the 1970s when as an assistant law professor at University of Belgrade in 1973 he published an article critical of the communist system entitled \\"Which values are protected by our laws?\\". He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and thrown out of the Law School. In 1990 he was readmitted to the Law School as a full-time professor, and at the beginning of 1996 the President of Bosnia's Republika Srpska Radovan Karadžić appointed him a Senator of the entity. On 23 February 2007, Čavoški was briefly questioned by the police in Republika Srpska after visiting the family of Radovan Karadžić, a fugitive accused of war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War.

It broadcasts programming from ERT World and local Canadian content produced by Odyssey TV. It launched in November 2001 on Rogers Cable. Programming on ERT World Canada includes news, talk shows, documentaries, sports, cultural programs and more. ERT World is the international service of ERT, Greece's public broadcaster. ERT World is also unofficially referred to as OTN2. History ERT World Canada was licensed by the CRTC on December 14, 2000 as Odyssey II. Decision CRTC 2000-642 Since its inception in 2001 up until 2003, Odyssey II (as it was then known) featured programming from Greece's top private network - MEGA Channel. In the summer of 2003, a dispute arose between Odyssey Television Network and the North American distributors of MEGA Channel and the programming was subsequently pulled. A short while later, OTN2 began airing programming from ERT World which subsequently led to the channel being renamed ERT World Canada. In June 2013, ERT World was shut down in Greece by the Greek government due to a restructuring of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation. The government had announced that a new, smaller public broadcaster would launch in early 2014 and it would feature an international feed for Greeks abroad. Due to continued political instability in Greece and several changes in government, the public broadcasting service has gone through significant turmoil. Due to the loss of programming, ERT World Canada has been airing programming from Greek Cinema since the shut down of ERT World, on a temporary basis. On July 30, 2013, Rogers Cable replaced ERT World Canada in their lineup with Alpha Sat, a private network from Greece. On August 30, 2013, the CRTC approved Odyssey Television Network's request to convert ERT World Canada from a licensed Category B speciality service to an exempted Cat.

His role in the band includes performing as a lead vocalist and percussionist. Early and personal life Lennon was born in Venice, California, the son of William and Isabelle Lennon. His given name is Christopher. The explanation he gives for his nickname is: \\"When I was brought home from the hospital as a brand new baby, March 1960, everyone was calling me 'Chrissy', like people do with newborns. You add an 'e' or 'y' or whatever to their name as an instant nickname. Okay, so my brother Joe was 3 years old and he couldn't say 'Chrissy', and kept saying 'Kippy'. My brother Dan, who was ten, thought that was hilarious, and from that day on, literally my first day at home, I was dubbed Kippy, never to be called Christopher again except by doctors, teachers, cops, and my mom if she was mad at me.\\" When Lennon was nine years old, he and his family endured the shooting death of their father, William. Chet Young, a stalker who believed himself to be married to Kipp's sister Peggy (of The Lennon Sisters) felt that the father stood in the way and had to be eliminated. Lying in wait, Young shot him in the parking lot of the Marina Del Rey golf course and two months later used the same gun to commit suicide. The family later discovered an unopened letter having a cutout of Mr. Lennon, a picture of a gun pointed at his head, and the words \\"High Noon\\" (the time of the murder) (source Dr. Doreen Orion, I Know You Really Love Me). Career =Music= Venice was founded in 1977; the band was initially founded by him and his cousin Michael Lennon. The following year Michael's brother Mark joined, with Kipp's brother Pat joining in 1980. Since that time, the two pairs of cousins have performed and released albums, in 1978 sharing lead vocals with his cousin Michael Lennon, in 1977 by cousins Michael and Kipp Lennon. Kipp plays percussion and writes songs for the band Venice, with whom he has released 13 albums and other works since 1986. He also sings for the Pine Mountain Logs, a band containing many of the members of Venice and playing only cover versions of rock songs. He performed with the rest of the band on their live DVD, \\"Venice, Live at the Royal Carre Theater.\\" Additionally, Lennon released one solo album, \\"Boom Boom Party\\" (CBS/Sony), in 1987. Lennon sang with David Crosby on his solo album Thousand Roads, and also performed vocals for the song \\"Suspension,\\" which was the main title of the 1979 theatrical pilot of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Lennon is the youngest brother of the popular female quartet The Lennon Sisters, who rose to fame on The Lawrence Welk Show and continued a successful singing career in the subsequent decades. =Film= Although Kipp Lennon did not appear in the 1987 Disney movie Double Switch, he did perform the vocals for the songs used in the soundtrack, \\"Turn up the Radio\\", \\"All Day, All Night\\", and \\"One Step Closer\\". =Television roles= Lennon has contributed to several episodes of The Simpsons: in season 3's \\"Stark Raving Dad\\", although Michael Jackson (credited as \\"John Jay Smith\\") performed the speaking part of Leon Kompowsky, a character who pretended he was Michael Jackson, Lennon sang the songs due to contractual obligations from Jackson with his record company at the time.Brooks, James L. (2003). Commentary for \\"Stark Raving Dad\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Most notably he sang the song \\"Happy Birthday Lisa,\\" written by Jackson within the episode. He also provides Jackson's singing voice in The Jacksons: An American Dream. Lennon returned as Kompowsky to sing the extra verses Bart wrote for his sister in season 29's \\"Mr. Lisa's Opus\\". Lennon also sang the songs \\"Flaming Moe's\\" (a spoof of the theme song from the TV series Cheers) in the episode \\"Flaming Moe's\\", \\"The Sound of Grandpa\\" from \\"Lady Bouvier's Lover\\", and \\"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\\" from \\"Duffless\\". He sang the original song \\"I'm Checking In\\" featured in the Betty Ford musical in \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\". In addition to The Simpsons, Lennon voiced Michael Jackstone on The Flintstone Kids' Just Say No Special, and various roles in The Story of Santa Claus, The Fall Guy, Eight Is Enough, and the TV series of Herbie the Love Bug. Lennon also sang the theme songs to C.H.U.D. II: Bud the C.H.U.D. (1989) and the theatrical pilot of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979).

Since 2000 she is directly involved in protests for gender justice, for fighting violence against women, for miniorites's rights, for environmental causes.  Contributions to democratic culture, political theory, gender studies, ethics and education By writing in 1995 The Thought of the Shadow, she became the first Romanian feminist philosopher, criticizing the philosophic postmodernism from a feminist perspective. In this book, Mihaela Miroiu analyzes the alliance and mésalliance between feminism and philosophy, including Romanian philosophy, arguing in favor of philosophical reassessment of the feminine and the womanly, in the context of a culture still dominated by dichotomies and the idea that women are rather treated as “shadows of philosophical thought”. In 1996 she wrote Convenio. On Nature, Women and Morals, a book from the perspective of Feminist Ethics and developed her own theoretical perspective in Ethics through the theory of the convenient. This philosophical perspective on morality is seen as “the particular approach in the context of feminist ethics, but by the type of arguments, tackles many other theoretical perspectives on morality: Kantianism, utilitarianism, ethics of rights, Rawls’s theory of justice and its critics, as well as ethics of care. In 1997 she published with Vladimir Pasti and Cornel Codiță the book Romania. Matter of Facts - a diagnosis of the evolution of the Romanian society (which she characterizes as a “survival society” with a “show-room democracy”. In 1999 she publishes The Backward-Looking Society, a book in which she analysis the ideological and political tendencies of the post- communist society, as a “cocktail of conservatisms”, a dominant combination between left-conservatism, represented by the socialists, well supported by the majority of the electorate in terms of deindustrialization, loss of status and employment; and right-conservatism, represented by National Liberal Party and National Peasant Party, also dominant in the mainstream of public intellectuals. In 2000 she initiates the theorization and analysis of leftist conservatism internationally, in the context of the XVIII-lea International Congress of Political Science Association (IPSA), in Quebec with the paper “Poverty, Authority and Leftist Conservatism”. In 2004, she published The Road to Autonomy. Feminist Political Theories, the first book of feminist political theories by a Romanian author. In this context, Mihaela Miroiu analyzes the evolution and trends of feminist theories and political movements, including Romania in the general research context. She coordinated with Laura Grunberg books on gender studies such as Gender and Education and Gender and Society (1997). In 2002, with Otilia Dragomir she edited the book Feminist Lexicon, a dictionary that has the role to initiate in the study of Romanian feminist authors, publications and women's movements. In 2003 she wrote the first guide of policies that promote gender equity in higher education in Eastern Europe- Guidelines for Promoting Gender Equity in Higher Education in Central and Eastern Europe. She contributed to the affiliation of Gender studies at ATHENA European Network for Gender Studies in 2002. She has also implemented gender policies projects for the Romanian Ministry of Education. She coordinated the Gender Barometer, with Renate Weber (2000), the first national research in regard to the perceptions, relations and roles on gender in the Romanian society. She edited with Maria Bucur the book Patriarchy and Emancipation in the Romanian Political Thought (2002), Birth. Living Histories with Otilia Dragomir (2010) and the book Feminist and environmentalist movements in Romania (2015). Mihaela Miroiu introduced the classes of Political Ethics in 1997http://www.mihaela.miroiu.snspa.ro/curriculum%20vitae.htm and wrote in collaboration with Gabriela Blebea, the first book on Professional Ethics in 2001. Significant for her constant interest for an ethical perspective in Political Theories and Gender Policies is that she used a grid of Political Ethics in the design of the analysis in the book Contemporary Political Ideologies (2012). She was also interested in the analysis of how political actors used conflicts derived from strategies of lustration in Romania.“Morality in Politics, or the Politics of Morality? “Neo-Purification” in Romania, in volumul, Applied Etics. Perspectives from Romania, Valentin Mureșan and Shunzo Majima (Eds), Hokkaido University Press, 2013 She has also coordinated a first national research about Ethics inside Romanian universities and the draft code of ethics adopted by the Ministry of Education in 2005. She has taught a course on Applied Ethics at the Psychology Masters at Babeș-Bolyai, between 2000 and 2011. She currently teaches Ethics in International Relations at SNSPA.http://dri.snspa.ro/v1/wp- content/uploads/23.Eticainrelatiileinternationale-RIIE.pdf Regarding educational politics, Miroiu has contributed to the reform of the Philosophy curricula in high school, after the fall of communism. She coordinated the first Philosophy handbook in 1993, which was published for 7 years afterwards. She coordinated the first handbook of Civic Culture for high school - Civic Culture, Democracy, Human Rights, Tolerance in 1995. Other important publications are the ones analyzing educational policies, such as the book The Romanian Education Today, (co-author with Gabriel Ivan, Vladimir Pasti, Adrian Miroiu) and the analysis of gender policies in education, through international grants - The Gender Dimension of Education in Romania, Institute for Advanced Studies, Viena (2001) and Case Study on Gender-sensitive Educational policy and Practice, SNSPA (2003) and the book Guidelines for Promoting Gender Equity in Higher Education in Central and Eastern Europe (2003). Mihaela Mioriu drew on literary writing ever since she was in high school. She continued to write literature, first for her friends – Stories about Cadmav – in the 1980s, but she published the short stories and the novel only after 1990.Mihaela Miroiu, “Intre autobiografie si CV”, Secolul 20, nr. 8, 1998 In 2005, with Mircea Miclea she published the autobiographical book The R’East and the West and « With my own woman mind »(2017). Critics A series of critics arose from other feminists, many of them East European, and they refer to the fact that she rejects the idea of compatibility between feminism and communism, as long as women could not freely associate, express their own interests and change the cultural, civic and political agenda. The most significant dispute in regard to these arguments was in Aspasia International Yearbook of Central, Eastern and Southeastern European Women’s and Gender History, Volume I, New York, 2007, in the context put to debate by Miroiu “Communism was a State Patriarchy, not a State Feminism”. A series of authors criticize her perspective like Krassimira Daskalova, Elena Gapova, Angelika Passara, while others review their own perspectives assumed in the 70s in regard to the relation between feminism and Marxism.Aspasia.

Their Relevance in Eastern and Central Europe and the Former Soviet Union Signs Vol. 29, No. 3 (Spring 2004), pp. 695-726, http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/381105?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Andreea Molocea (2015, 31) in ”(Re)construcția feminismului românesc (1999-2000)” speaks of Romanian feminism as being closely connected with academia, due to the fact the majority of early feminists were coming from the academic sphere. Thus, the activists tended to limit their diversity of action and were rather open to Western feminist theories. Having the tendency to report to and to signal issues in conformity with their status and perspectives, the early feminists omitted the issues of poor women, confronting with the difficulties of the market transition, issues that these feminists knew less because they have never been researched. This is also due to the lack of rural NGOs or activities targeted and representing women from such areas (Molocea 2015, 34). Another critic relies on Romanian liberal feminism that tended to be homogenous and generally focused on the rights, liberties and autonomy of women and its lack of intersectionality with ethnicity, class or sexual orientation (Vlad 2015). Also the professionalization of the women's movement and the lack of contact with the women that feminism represents is another criticism. Mihaela Miroiu answers these critics in the book studying the analysis of women's and environmental movements from Romania, as well as international critics in the study “On Women, Feminism and Democracy” vol. Post-Communist Romania at Twenty-Five. Linking Past, Present and Future (Stan and Vancea eds, 2015).

Names and etymology The name probably comes from the Slavic personal name Radša/Radoslav or the Slavic stem vorč-/vrača (a fence). The name was adopted by Germans as Rechesdorf (literally Rača's village, 1390). The Germanized form had been used even by the Slovaks themselves, e.g., Račissdorf (1914), Račištorf (1920-1946) except for a short period in 1920 when the official name was Raslavice. In 1946, its original name Rača was restored. History Rača was mentioned for the first time in 1296 as a vineyard village under the name villa Racha.

RNA spike-ins are short synthetic RNA polymers. An RNA spike-in is an RNA transcript of known sequence and quantity used to calibrate measurements in RNA hybridization assays, such as DNA microarray experiments, RT-qPCR, and RNA-Seq. A spike-in is designed to bind to a DNA molecule with a matching sequence, known as a control probe. This process of specific binding is called hybridization. A known quantity of RNA spike-in is mixed with the experiment sample during preparation. The degree of hybridization between the spike-ins and the control probes is used to normalize the hybridization measurements of the sample RNA.  History  Nucleic acid hybridization assays have been used for decades to detect specific sequences of DNA or RNA, with a DNA microarray precursor used as early as 1965. In such assays, positive control oligonucleotides are necessary to provide a standard for comparison of target sequence concentration, and to check and correct for nonspecific binding; that is, incidental binding of the RNA to non-complementary DNA sequences. These controls became known as \\"spike-ins\\". With the advent of DNA microarray chips in the 1990s and the commercialization of high-throughput methods for sequencing and RNA detection assays, manufacturers of hybridization assay \\"kits\\" started to provide pre-developed spike-ins. In the case of gene expression assay microarrays or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), RNA spike-ins are used.  Manufacturing  RNA spike-ins can be synthesized by any means of creating RNA synthetically, or by using cells to transcribe DNA to RNA in vivo (in cells). RNA can be produced in vitro (cell free) using RNA polymerase and DNA with the desired sequence. Large scale biotech manufacturers produce RNA synthetically via high-throughput techniques and provide solutions of RNA spike-ins at predetermined concentration. Bacteria containing DNA (usually on plasmids) for transcription to spike-ins are also commercially available. The purified RNA can be stored long-term in a buffered solution at low temperature.  Applications  Example of DNA microarray data. The bright spots show locations where hybridization has occurred, indicating that RNA of the corresponding sequence was present in the sample. = DNA microarrays = DNA microarrays are solid surfaces, usually a small chip, to which short DNA polymers of known sequence are covalently bound. When a sample of unknown RNA is flowed over the array, the RNA base pairs with and binds to complementary DNA. Bound transcripts can be detected, indicating the presence of RNA with the corresponding sequence. DNA microarray assays are useful in studies of gene expression, because many of the mRNA transcripts present in a cell can be detected at the same time. RNA spike-ins of known quantity can provide a baseline signal for comparison with the signal from transcripts of unknown quantity, such that the data can be normalized within an array and between different arrays. = Sequencing = RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is performed by reverse transcribing RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and high-throughput sequencing the cDNA. Such high-throughput methods can be error prone, and known controls are necessary to detect and correct for levels of error. RNA spike-in controls can provide a measure of sensitivity and specificity of an RNA-Seq experiment.

It forms a circular route around the city of Coventry covering countryside in both the West Midlands and Warwickshire. The path is managed by A Coventry Way Association. Route As a circular path, the Coventry Way can be started and finished at any point and walked in either direction, but for the purposes of the annual challenge event it starts at finishes at the Queen's Head public house in Meriden and proceeds anticlockwise. From the Queen's Head it passes through the churchyard of St Lawrence and then south through the Meriden Gap towards Berkswell, following the Heart of England Way for part of the route; the two paths diverge near Berkswell, with the Heart of England Way continuing southwest towards Balsall Common and the Coventry Way southeast. It joins the Berkswell to Kenilworth Greenway (the route of the former railway line) at Carol Green, passes to the east of Burton Green and follows the Greenway to its end in Kenilworth (8 miles from Meriden). At Kenilworth the Coventry Way joins the Centenary Way, the two routes leave the town via its golf course and cross the A46 to Stoneleigh (10 miles). They pass the church of St Mary the Virgin in Stoneleigh, cross the River Sowe close to its confluence with the Avon, then cross the Avon itself before reaching the hamlet of Stareton (12 miles), where they turn east towards Bubbenhall (14 miles), from where Shakespeare's Avon Way follows the same route as the other two paths - although in the opposite direction, since the latter is usually walked from the source of the Avon to its mouth. From Bubbenhall the three paths follow the same route northeast to Ryton-on-Dunsmore (17 miles), cross under the A45 and continue to Wolston (19 miles), where they diverge: the Centenary Way goes directly north to Brandon, while the Coventry Way and Shakespeare's Avon Way head northeast, under the Coventry to Rugby railway line to Bretford (20 miles). Here they too separate: Shakespeare's Avon Way follows the path of the river east towards Church Lawford, while the Coventry Way heads north to Brinklow (23 miles). It traverses the motte and bailey (the site of Brinklow Castle and passes the church of St John the Baptist. North of Brinklow, the Coventry Way crosses Smite Brook and reaches the Oxford Canal at Grimes Bridge, where it also crosses the Centenary Way. It continues northwest along the towpath of the canal, passing under the M6, leaves the canal at Hopsford Aqueduct, and passes Ansty Golf Course to reach Ansty village (27 miles). After leaving Ansty, the path briefly rejoins the Oxford Canal before leaving it again as it passes under the M69. The path follows the M69 for a short distance before turning northwest, passing through the grounds of Barnacle Hall and into Barnacle village (28 miles). From Barnacle it continues west, crosses the Coventry Canal at Bedworth Hill Bridge and passes under the Coventry to Nuneaton railway line to arrive in Bedworth (30 miles). The Coventry Way passes through housing estates in the western area of Bedworth, leaving the town close to the former site of Newdigate Colliery; it then heads towards Fillongley, but turns southwest before reaching it, arriving instead at Corley Ash (35 miles). From there it crosses a bridge over the M6 and traverses the small boggy area of Corley Moor to reach the village of the same name (37 miles). Beyond Corley Moor, the route passes through Birchley Hays Wood, where it rejoins the Heart of England Way. Both paths continue southwest through Meriden Shafts, emerging at Eaves Green (39 miles). The last part of the Coventry Way is on roads, under the A45 and back to Meriden, where it finishes at the Queen's Head (40 miles). Coventry Way and HS2 The proposed route of the HS2 rail line would coincide with the route of the Coventry Way between Carol Green and Burton Green.

Early in her career, she was popular for singing the song \\"The Bell goes a-ringing for Sarah.\\" At the Oxford Music Hall, she had appeared with Euphrosyne Parepa, who later married Carl Rosa. Santley was slim and pretty and became much photographed for visiting cards, postcards and advertising. Early in her career, she played in F. C. Burnand's St. George and the Dragon. as Princess Toto In 1871–72, she visited the US, where she appeared on Broadway, including in a revival of the hit 1866 musical, The Black Crook. Returning to London in 1872, she appeared in Georges Jacobi and Frederick Clay's London production of The Black Crook at the Alhambra Theatre, where, the next year, she also starred in the title role in Burnand's English version of Jacques Offenbach's La Belle Hélène. Later in 1873, she sang Cunegonde in Le roi Carotte. In 1874, she played Haidee in H. J. Byron's Don Juan, then in La Jolie Parfumeuse, followed by the title role in Whittington, by Offenbach.Perdoni, Leon A. \\"An Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square Programme for 1873\\". Arthur Lloyd, 2005, accessed 7 September 2012 In 1876, she played Wilhelmina in The Jolly Waterman at the Opera Comique and then created the title character in (and produced) Princess Toto, a comic opera by W. S. Gilbert and Frederic Clay. Thereafter, Clay wrote numerous songs (such as her popular hit, \\"Nobody knows as I know\\") and other operas for Santley. Chapter 8 Available online here In 1878, Santley produced and starred in Dipunacy, which was a popular burlesque of Diplomacy. 1879, at the Royalty Theatre, Santley played in La Marjolaine and starred in (and produced) Little Cinderella and in the hit Tita in Thibet by Frank Desprez. In 1880, she played in the Drury Lane pantomime Mother Goose (and the Enchanted Beauty) with Arthur Roberts, the popular music hall comedian.

Richard D'Oyly Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 at the Royalty to present Lischen and Fritzen, Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and Happy Hampstead by Carte (under the pseudonym Mark Lynne) and his secretary, Frank Desprez. In 1877, Santley became the manager of the Royalty Theatre, an association lasting some thirty years. She later seems to have acquired the head lease.The Pitt Estate in Dean Street – The Royalty Theatre Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 215–21 (British History Online), accessed 15 January 2009 Also in 1877, the First Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade strongly recommended to the Metropolitan Board of Works the immediate closure of the theatre. Santley, however, had it reconstructed to designs of architect Thomas Verity, whose plans, providing improved means of egress, were approved in 1882. Many of the productions at the Royalty were opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer, formerly of the Gaiety Theatre, staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the Comédie-Française appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognised home of the Parisian drama.' There was further reconstruction of the theatre in 1883, and Santley was praised for the theatre's renovations then and in the later 1905 renovation. The opening of Shaftesbury Avenue and of new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the Lyric Theatre and the Apollo Theatre, drew audiences away from the little Royalty theatre in Dean Street, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering. This led to her providing an occasional home for the Independent Theatre Society, who produced plays on a subscription-only basis – hence evading the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. The London première's of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts (on 13 March 1891) and Émile Zola's Thérèse Raquin (on 9 October 1891), led to a storm of protest, with some critics calling for the withdrawal of Santley's licence. George Bernard Shaw's first play, Widowers' Houses, premièred for the Society at the theatre on 9 December 1892. When the theatre finally had a great success, with Brandon Thomas's play, Charley's Aunt, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger Globe Theatre. In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was Arthur Bourchier, and the theatre underwent another renovation. He produced, among other plays, The Chili Widow, an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights. In 1899, the first production of the Incorporated Stage Society took place with the first performance of George Bernard Shaw's You Never Can Tell. In 1900–01 Mrs. Patrick Campbell hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre. Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by W. B. Yeats and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of Synge's first play, The Shadow of the Glen. In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays. Personal Santley married Lieutenant Colonel Lockhart Mure Hartley Kennedy in 1901.\\"Evangeline Estella G.

Life  Mrs Chippy, a tiger-striped tabby, was taken on board the ship used by the expedition's Weddell Sea party, , as a ship's cat by carpenter and master shipwright Harry \\"Chippy\\" McNish (\\"Chippy\\" being a colloquial British term for a carpenter). The cat acquired its name because, once aboard, it followed McNish around like an overly attentive wife. One month after the ship set sail for Antarctica it was discovered that, despite her name, Mrs Chippy was actually a male. By that time, however, the name had stuck. He was described as \\"full of character\\" by members of the expedition and impressed the crew with his ability to walk along the ship's inch-wide rails in even the roughest seas. In Captain Frank Worsley’s diary he describes Mrs Chippy climbing the rigging \\"... exactly after the manner of a seaman going aloft\\". Bronze sculpture of Mrs Chippy on the grave of Harry McNish in Karori Cemetery which was added by the New Zealand Antarctic Society Mrs Chippy’s voyage was not without incident. Storekeeper Thomas Orde-Lees, in a diary entry dated 13 September 1914, relates that \\"An extraordinary thing happened during the night. The tabby cat jumped overboard through one of the cabin portholes and the officer on watch, Lt. Hudson, heard her screams and turned the ship smartly round & picked her up. She must have been in the water 10 minutes or more\\". The cat was retrieved by the ship’s biologist, Robert Clark, using one of his sample nets. After the Endurance became trapped in pack ice and was destroyed, Shackleton decided that Mrs Chippy and five of the sled dogs that had been carried on board would not survive. In a diary entry dated 29 October 1915 he recorded: McNish was very attached to Mrs Chippy and never forgave Shackleton for having him killed. McNish died, destitute, in Wellington, New Zealand, in September 1930, and was buried with full naval honours in an unmarked grave. The New Zealand Antarctic Society placed a headstone on the grave in 1959. To this they added a life-size bronze statue of Mrs Chippy in 2004, funded through public subscription, to complete a tribute and memorial to the carpenter and his much-loved cat. In February 2011, Mrs Chippy and expedition member Perce Blackborow were featured on a postage stamp issued by the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Stamp – Perce Blackborow and Mrs Chippy  Cultural references  A novel by Caroline Alexander, Mrs. Chippy's Last Expedition : The Remarkable Journal of Shackleton's Polar-Bound Cat, was published by Bloomsbury in 1997. The book provides an account of Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, covering the period 15 January 1914 to 29 October 1915, in the form of a journal written from a cat’s point of view, supposedly by Mrs Chippy. The final entry recounts Shackleton instructing his crew, now camped on the ice pack following the destruction of their ship, that to ensure their survival \\"Anything that cannot pull its weight or is not useful to the Expedition must be put down\\". The book ends poignantly with Mrs Chippy (clearly unaware of the implications of Shackleton's order) relaxing in a tent, reminiscing over past adventures and, after being given a treat of a bowl of sardines, looking forward to assisting with the rest of the expedition. Mrs Chippy was portrayed in the 2002 Channel 4 mini-series Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh, with the credits stating that the part was played by 'Mac'. Wolf Howard, Mrs Chippy The painting Mrs Chippy by Wolf Howard shows the cat \\"about to be shot\\", while in the background Endurance is depicted trapped in the ice and its crew can be seen launching a small open boat on a rescue mission.

He amassed La Liga totals of 168 games and six goals over the course of ten seasons, representing in the competition Sporting de Gijón, Sevilla and Getafe. Club career Born in La Felguera, Asturias, Cotelo began his career at local Sporting de Gijón, and played for their reserves during his first two seasons as a senior. In 1993–94 he appeared once for the main squad and, after a loan to Segunda División side CD Badajoz, would become an important player with the latter. After four full seasons with Gijón, Cotelo returned to La Liga with Sevilla FC, but would only appear five times for the Andalusians over one and a half campaigns, moving to UD Las Palmas in January 2003. In 2003–04 he was a key element in Getafe CF's first-ever promotion to the top flight, and went on to appear in a combined 93 league games the following three years. Used sparingly throughout 2007–08, Cotelo also played six incomplete UEFA Cup matches in the Madrid side's quarter-final run. In the next season he featured even less (five minutes of action), and was subsequently released. Not being able to find a new club, Cotelo retired from the game in early 2010, at the age of 35. He totalled 349 appearances in the country's two major divisions. On 20 August 2015, Cotelo returned to Sporting to work as a match delegate.

Roy Ward Dickson (August 18, 1910 – September 16, 1978), born Richard Louis del Valle, was a pioneering Canadian television producer, writer, and emcee. Dubbed King of Quiz by an Edmonton journalist, Dickson invented the game show. His first show, Professor Dick and His Question Box, debuted on radio in 1935, followed by The Quizz Club in 1936. Born in London, United Kingdom, Dickson moved to Canada where by 1929 he was a secondary school teacher in Winnipeg. He moved to British Columbia by 1931, working in the Vancouver Suns advertising department. In 1934 he relocated to Ontario where he joined Toronto Star and developed his first student quizzes. In the early 1950s, Dickson moved from radio to television with the TV show What d'you Know?, followed shortly afterwards by the world's first panel game, Claim to Fame. Over the next four decades, Roy devised and hosted numerous popular and successful television shows, in both Britain and Canada. Among his most famous shows were the long-running Fun Parade, which successfully transitioned from radio to television. His television quiz show Take a Chance was broadcast on CTV from 1961 to 1965 where at one point 438,000 viewers participated in that program's contests. The popular TV game show Mr. and Mrs. tested couples' knowledge of each other, and which was the forerunner for dozens of similar shows. Roy invented, produced and hosted the original Canadian version of Mr and Mrs. which became a popular show in the UK throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

The game featured two dueling knights rendered in monochrome vector graphics and based on crude motion capture techniques. Due to the limitations of the hardware used, the processor could not render the characters and gaming environment at the same time and backgrounds were printed, with the characters projected on the top. Controls Originally Skelly planned for a two-player system with each player using two joysticks, one to control the movement of the player and the other controlling the player's weapon. However, financial constraints restricted the cabinet to one stick for each player and a button to switch between character and weapon modes. The sticks were produced in house and installed in cabinets in a way that players found unresponsive and difficult to use. Influence The cabinets and hardware were produced on a low budget and proved to be very unreliable when compared to contemporary machines. As a result, very few remain in working order, with 10 machines registered with KLOV 10 machines registered with KLOV and only one known restored machine in the United Kingdom Warrior is emulated by MAME.

Career  The son of Major Guy Paget, he was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read Law, but did not graduate. Paget joined the Labour Party whilst he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, a decision made striking by the fact that his family had produced five generations of Conservative MPs. He was called to the bar in 1934. He stood as the Labour candidate for Northampton in 1935, but was not elected. During World War II he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (1940–43). After the war, he was advocate for Field Marshal Erich von Manstein during his trial for war crimes. He later wrote Manstein: His Campaigns and His Trial (1957). He took silk in 1947. He stood again as the Labour candidate for Northampton ten years later in 1945, and won the seat. He was repeatedly re-elected until 1974, when the constituency was abolished.A. Thomas Lane, Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders. Volume: 2, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1995, p.724. From 1960 to 1964, Paget successively served as junior opposition spokesman for the Royal Navy and the Army. He was an outspoken critic of Harold Wilson during the 1963 Labour Party leadership election. During his tenure in the House of Commons, he was an independent voice, playing a major role in the campaign to abolish capital punishment. He was a strong opponent of the execution of Derek Bentley, and argued for Timothy Evans to be posthumously pardoned for the murder of his child (a crime widely believed to have been committed by John Christie). Paget was initially supportive of British entry into the European Economic Community (EEC), and in 1954 became Secretary of the UK Council of the European Movement. But in later years his views changed: in 1971 he was one of a majority of Labour MPs to vote against membership, and during the 1975 EEC referendum campaign he gave a speech in the House of Lords in which he stated that the EEC was impotent in the face of the Soviet threat, and in the resulting vote a day later was one of only 20 peers to vote against remaining in the Community.\\"European Community: Membership\\". Parliamentary Debates (Hansard). 359. HL. 21 April 1975, col. 655; 22 April 1975, col. 873. On 2 January 1975, he was created a life peer as Baron Paget of Northampton, of Lubenham in the County of Leicestershire. Paget was said to be the slowest speaker in the House of Commons, and was master of the Pytchley Hunt from 1968 to 1971, an unusual position for a Labour MP.  Family  In 1931, he married Sybil Helen Gibbons (Nancy), daughter of Sills Clifford Gibbons. They occupied Lubenham Lodge 2 miles west of Market Harborough from 1964. He later separated from his wife, and had a relationship with Diana Spearman, widow of the Conservative MP SIr Alexander Spearman.

It manufactured its own brand of televisions in Athens, Texas until July 31, 1982; ten years later, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and reorganization which allowed it to stay in business and use future earnings to pay off creditors. The company is now based in Frisco, Texas. Known for its commercials touting its televisions as the \\"most expensive television set in America, and darn well worth it\\", the company was credited with introducing longer warranties to electronics retailing. History =Early products= The Curtis Mathes Corporation started in 1919 as Connor and Mathes, a manufacturer and retailer of automobile and tractor parts. By the late 1920s, the company moved into the air conditioning industry. It also manufactured wooden cabinets and eventually furniture, acquiring Hub Furniture in 1942. The leading product through the 1930s and '40s were electrical fans, many styles built into custom cabinets and permanent-type window fans. In the early '50s the company added a \\"central\\" or \\"attic fan\\" to its inventory. It pulled air from all open windows into the attic where it also ventilated the attic making the house much cooler. As compressors were commercially introduced in the late '40s, Curtis Mathes' Fort Worth factory began making a wide variety of compressors that could be used in cars or buildings. Leonard L. Northrup, Jr., became one of the leading distributors of Curtis Mathes Products including developing and selling an add-on air conditioning unit first used in Cadillacs. By the late 1940s, the Curtis Mathes Company had diversified into radios, having developed the large centerpiece radio for the living room to an artform. It was therefore logical that this approach would work in televisions as well. =Televisions= The Curtis Mathes Corporation was founded in 1957 and shortly thereafter entered the television industry, founding plants in Tarrant and Dallas Counties and in Athens, Texas, eventually moving most of its manufacturing to a huge Athens facility. From 1968 to 1988 it was the only fully American-owned electronics firm and the only American television manufacturer. In the late 1960s, Leonard L. Northrup, Jr., bought a controlling interest in Donmark Corporation, a manufacturer of residential air conditioning and heating equipment from his lifelong friend Curtis Mathes, Sr., as Curtis Mathes moved toward electronics. During the next few years Curtis Mathes worked to design a modular TV and modular TV parts and chassis, so that warranty service would involve quickly switching a part, tube, tuner or picture tube. These all had snap-in connectors and were held in place by brackets instead of solder or screws. He envisioned a TV that would never require costly repairs, and early on started offering a 4-year warranty on picture tube, parts and labor. By the mid-1970s and the advent of solid-state electronics, Mathes had achieved results. The TV consisted of 11 parts: 7 circuit boards, a tuner, a picture tube and a transformer, plus the cabinet. A repairman carried all ten electronic parts in his truck and a repair call seldom lasted more than 20 minutes. In home the fee was $20, and free in the shop. Curtis Mathes TVs that were used for rentals (such as ColorTyme) were sometimes rebranded \\"Rutherford\\". The company began to decline, going from a peak of 5000 employees and seven manufacturing facilities to about 50 employees in 1988 when it was sold to Enhanced Electronics. At the time of this sale, it was the last remaining fully U.S.-owned electronics company. For a time, the company sold equipment sourced from Matsushita, Pioneer, Thomson, Samsung, Daewoo, Toshiba, and other manufacturers. 2000s In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the Curtis Mathes brand became an in-house brand for the Kmart discount chain. As of late 2007, Curtis Mathes had re-emerged with products marketed at several discount retailers such as Wal-Mart, Sam's Club, Meijer and Target. Beginning in 2013, Curtis Mathes expanded its portfolio into LED lighting.  In popular culture  The TV sets were used for the monitors in the 1990 science fiction film Total Recall. The TV set was used in a late scene in the 1985 movie To Live and Die in L.A.. In the ending scene of the 1985 movie Real Genius a trailer being pulled by a RV a large box can be seen with the name Curtis Mathes in the trailer. In the film \\"At Close Range\\" 1986 at the forty three minute mark Curtis Mathes boxes can be seen, being part of the stolen goods cache.

He most recently served as the head football coach at Michigan State University, a position he had held since the 2007 season, presiding over one of the most successful eras in the program's history. He led the Michigan State Spartans to three Big Ten Conference championships, and eight victories over archrival Michigan in thirteen years. In 2013, he coached Michigan State to its first 13-win season and the program's fifth trip to the Rose Bowl, where they defeated Stanford and finished the season ranked No. 3 in the nation. At the time, this was only the second instance a Big Ten team had reached the 13-win mark, the other being Ohio State's national championship season in 2002, where Dantonio was the defensive coordinator. The 2013 season also marked the first time a Big Ten team won nine conference games by double digits in each contest. In 2015, Dantonio became the first head coach in Big Ten history to achieve at least 11 wins in five of six seasons. On December 6, 2015, Dantonio's Spartans qualified for the College Football Playoff for the first time in the program's history. In 2006, Dantonio was hired as the Spartans head coach, returning to the school where he served six years as an assistant coach under Nick Saban and Bobby Williams. Known as a defensive- minded coach, Dantonio led the Spartans to the school's first bowl game win since 2001, in the 2012 Outback Bowl, and the school's first Rose Bowl since 1988 in 2014. Dantonio's Spartans hold the active school record with four consecutive bowl wins. On October 8, 2011, Dantonio signed a contract extension that made him a \\"Spartan for life.\\" In 2014, he earned the second highest salary among college football coaches, due largely to a retention bonus. On September 21, 2019, with his 110th victory, Dantonio became the winningest head coach in MSU football surpassing Duffy Daugherty. Dantonio had compiled a 110–52 record through this date at Michigan State, giving him a .691 winning percentage, the highest of any Michigan State football coach since Clarence Munn, who coached the Spartans from 1947 to 1953. On February 4, 2020, Dantonio announced he would be retiring as the head coach of the Michigan State football team. Early life Mark Dantonio was born in El Paso, Texas, to Justin Dantonio and Maryan (née Sonsalla) Dantonio. Mark is of Italian descent. Dantonio's Grandfather Frank D'antonio moved from Montenerodomo, Italy, to the United States - losing the apostrophe at Ellis Island – in 1912. Mark was the second of four boys. When Mark was one, the family moved to Zanesville, Ohio, where Justin became the vice principal and basketball coach at Zanesville High School. Mark was an all-state safety at Zanesville.http://archive.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20081122/GW01/811220309/Mark- stability College career Dantonio attended the University of South Carolina and earned three letters as a defensive back for Coach Jim Carlen for the Gamecocks 1976-78. He earned a bachelor's degree in education from South Carolina in 1979. Dantonio later earned a master's degree in education from Ohio University in 1980.https://alumni.msu.edu/stay- informed/magazine/article.cfm?id=2425 Coaching career =Early coaching career= Dantonio began his coaching career at Ohio University, where he was a graduate assistant. In 1981, he made his first stop in the Big Ten Conference when he moved on to Purdue University as a graduate assistant. He spent two years, in 1983 and 1984, as a graduate assistant at Ohio State University under head coach Earle Bruce. In 1986, he began a five-year stint on Jim Tressel's staff at Youngstown State University as a defensive secondary coach. In 1990, Dantonio led the Penguins' defense to an 11–0 record and a #2 ranking nationally. Glen Mason hired Dantonio in 1991 to be the defensive secondary coach for the Kansas Jayhawks. When Nick Saban was hired at Michigan State in 1995, he hired Dantonio to join his staff in East Lansing where he remained even after Saban left for LSU. After Bobby Williams was named head coach in 1999 following Saban's departure, Dantonio was promoted to associate head coach where he remained through the 2000 season. At Ohio State in 2001, Dantonio reunited with his former Youngstown State boss and good friend Jim Tressel when he opted out of East Lansing to serve as defensive coordinator at Ohio State University for three seasons. His defense became known as one of the stingiest in the country. During the Buckeyes' 2002 National Championship season, Ohio State ranked second nationally in scoring defense and third in rushing defense. For his efforts, Dantonio was named a 2002 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top college football assistant coach. In the 2003 season, his defense ranked number one in the country in rushing defense and ninth in total defense, which led the Buckeyes to an 11–2 record and #4 national ranking. Six Buckeye defenders were named first team All-Big Ten during Dantonio's tenure. Thirteen were drafted into the NFL, including two first round picks in Chris Gamble and Will Smith. = Cincinnati (2004–2006) = Dantonio was named head coach at Cincinnati on December 23, 2003. He became the first head coach in 23 years to lead the school to a winning season in his first season at UC. The Bearcats' 7–5 record included a 5–3 record in Conference USA, which was good enough for a second-place finish. The Bearcats finished the season on a winning note with a 32–14 win over Marshall in the PlainsCapital Fort Worth Bowl. During Dantonio's time at UC, he led the Bearcats to a bowl game victory and directed the team's transition into the Big East Conference. As head coach, Dantonio had 15 players earn all- conference honors and 25 received conference academic recognition. =Michigan State (2007–2020)= Mark Dantonio became the 24th head coach at Michigan State on November 27, 2006. Upon his arrival, Dantonio planned to return the Spartans to a more traditional philosophy on offense and defense, eliminating the spread offense and the \\"bandit\\" linebacker/safety position used under previous head coach John L. Smith.Rexrode, Joe. \\"Inside the Deal\\". Lansing State Journal.

December 28, 2007. http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273620127 2008 season Dantonio's second season at MSU began with a loss at Cal, after which the Spartans came home and won six straight games against Eastern Michigan, Florida Atlantic, Notre Dame, Indiana, Iowa, and Northwestern. The victories propelled Michigan State into the top 25. Following a lopsided 45–7 loss to the Ohio State Buckeyes, the Spartans beat Michigan, 35–21, winning in Ann Arbor for the first time since 1990. Michigan State won its final two home games against Wisconsin and Purdue before losing to Penn State in Happy Valley. A win against Penn State would have resulted in Michigan State splitting the Big Ten Conference title with Ohio State. The nine regular season wins were Michigan State's most since 1999. Michigan State finished third in the conference and was invited to play Georgia in the Capital One Bowl. Michigan State lost the game, 24–12, finishing the season 9–4. 2009 season Dantonio's third season, 2009, was disappointing in performance and off-the-field issues. The team lost five games (Central Michigan, at Notre Dame, Iowa, at Minnesota, Texas Tech) in which they held the lead in the fourth quarter, leading to a disappointing 6–7 record. 2010 season On September 19, 2010, just hours after a stunning fake field goal touchdown pass gave MSU a 34–31 overtime victory over Notre Dame, Dantonio checked himself into a hospital after noticing chest pains. He later suffered a heart attack. He had a stent implanted in a blocked artery near his heart. His doctor stated that the damage was minimal and that Dantonio was expected to make a full recovery. Offensive coordinator Don Treadwell became acting head coach while Dantonio recovered. On September 30, after Dantonio had stated that he would be coaching the next game from the press box and just two days before Michigan State played Wisconsin, Dantonio was admitted back into the hospital as a blood clot was found in his leg. Dantonio had to watch the game from his hospital room. He was reportedly released from Sparrow Hospital around noon on October 4, 2010. On October 9, Dantonio coached his first game since his heart attack against rival Michigan. Michigan State won the game, 34-17, in Ann Arbor. The Spartans under Dantonio continued to win and on November 20 reached 10–1 on the season, winning all home games for the first time during his tenure. It was just the third time in school history that Michigan State had won 10 or more games in a season, the other two seasons being those of 1965 and 1999. On November 27, 2010, Dantonio's Spartans defeated Penn State 28–22 in Happy Valley to finish the season 11–1 and clinch a share of the Big Ten Championship for the first time since 1990. On December 5, 2010, MSU announced that the Spartans were selected to play in the Capital One Bowl on January 1, 2011, against Alabama (ranked 15th in the BCS standings).Press Conference. \\"Big Ten Champions Accept Invitation from Capital One Bowl\\" \\"Michigan State Spartans\\" East Lansing, 5 December 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-5. The Spartans lost to the Crimson Tide 49–7 and finished 11–2. 2011 season In 2011, Michigan State had another successful year. The Spartans beat the Ohio State Buckeyes on the road for the first time since 1998, defeated arch-rival Michigan, and upset #6 Wisconsin on a last-second Hail Mary pass from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol. The Spartans finished 10–2 (7–1 in Big Ten play), earning the Legends Division championship and a place in the inaugural Big Ten Championship Game. After coming up just short in a rematch with Wisconsin, MSU was selected to play in the Outback Bowl against the Georgia Bulldogs. Dantonio led his team to a triple-overtime victory, his first bowl win at MSU. The Spartans reached the 11-win mark for the second straight season, finishing 11–3. 2012 season In 2012, Dantonio led the Spartans to a 7–6 record and a Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl win against Texas Christian University. The season started with promise, when preseason #13 Michigan State beat #24 Boise State; but two games later, the #10 Spartans lost to No. 20 Notre Dame, and went on to suffer four home losses in Big Ten play. The defense finished ninth in FBS points allowed, giving up just 16.3 points per game, but the offense struggled to score in several games. MSU lost a 12–10 decision to Michigan, despite the defense keeping the Wolverines out of the end zone the entire game. In May 2013, four months after the end of the 2012 season, Dantonio filmed himself at the Rose Bowl, predicting a successful 2013. 2013 season In 2013, Dantonio's team finished 11–1 in the regular season, including notable victories over Michigan (29–6) and Nebraska (41–28) to secure the third and final Legends Division title. On December 7, 2013, Michigan State, ranked #10 at the time of the game, defeated second-ranked Ohio State 34–24 in the Big Ten Championship Game in Indianapolis. The win snapped Ohio State's 24-game winning streak and sent Michigan State to its first Rose Bowl since the 1987–88 season. Michigan State was ranked #4 in the final BCS standings, its highest rank since the BCS's inception. The Spartans defeated the fifth-ranked Stanford Cardinal 24–20 in the 100th Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 2014. Dantonio was named Big Ten Football Coach of the Year. 2014 season In 2014, the Spartans finished the regular season 10–2, finishing second in the East division with a 7–1 record and ranked #8 in the nation. After losing to third-ranked Oregon in the season's second game, the Spartans reeled off nine wins in their next 10 games. The Spartans earned a bid to the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, part of the New Year's Six bowls, and rallied from 20 points down in the fourth quarter to defeat fifth-ranked Baylor 42–41 and finish the season with an overall record of 11–2. The two losses came against Oregon and Ohio State, the teams that would play in the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. After the Cotton Bowl game, Dantonio said \\"It's a feeling of belief in each other, and that's what we have. We don't give up on each other. Consequently, they don't give up in the game. We just keep playing hard. And that's what we've been able to accomplish.\\" 2015 season The 2015 season included an unlikely 17–14 road win against then-#2 Ohio State, in which the Spartans played without starting quarterback Connor Cook. This season was also known for its game- changing touchdown in the last 10 seconds of the Michigan game, 27-23.https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-colleges-football- michigan-state-michigan-spt-20151017-story.html MSU also defeated Oregon, Penn State and Michigan to finish the regular season with an 11–1 record, winning the East division with a 7–1 record. Michigan State went on to beat an undefeated Iowa team in the Big Ten Championship Game, and ended the season ranked #3 in the nation. The #3 ranking earned the Spartans a spot in the NCAA College Football Playoff and the right to play #2 ranked Alabama on New Year's Eve for a spot in the Championship game.shttp://www.collegefootballplayoff.com/ They lost to eventual National Champion Alabama in the semi-final game, 38–0. 2016 season In 2016, the Spartans had their worst season under Dantonio, going 1–8 in Big Ten play and finishing the season at 3–9, the program's worst overall record in more than 30 years. 2017 season The 2017 season featured upset wins over then-#7 Penn State at home and then-#7 Michigan on the road. Dantonio moved to 8–3 all-time against in-state rival Michigan, as the Spartans forced five turnovers and defeated the Wolverines 14–10 in Ann Arbor. They finished the regular season at #16 in the CFP rankings and second in the B1G East Division (7–2). The Spartans were selected to play the 9–3 Washington State Cougars in the Holiday Bowl on December 28. The Spartans routed the Cougars, 42–17, to finish the season 10–3, giving Dantonio his sixth season of 10+ wins at MSU. 2018 season Michigan State started the season ranked #11 in the AP Top 25 Poll. They avoided an upset by unranked Utah State in the first game of the season, with a late interception from junior linebacker Joe Bachie preserving a 38–31 victory. In the Spartans' second game of the season they would fall to Arizona State 16-13. Falling back in the polls, Michigan State then defeated Indiana 35–21. The following week Dantonio's team beat Central Michigan 31–20 in their last non-conference game of the season. Michigan State was then upset at home by Northwestern 29–19 the following week, sending them out of the AP top 25. The following week, the Spartans traveled to play a top 10 team in Penn State. Despite being heavy underdogs, Michigan State stunned Penn State with a last second touchdown pass to win 21–17. On October 20th, Michigan State hosted Michigan, and the Wolverine defense overpowered Michigan State 21–7. The following week, the Spartans would rebound to beat Purdue by a score of 23–13. MSU then traveled to Maryland and dominated the Terps 27–3. After the win, MSU came home and lost to Ohio State, 26–6, before traveling to Lincoln and losing to Nebraska, 9–6. In the final game of the season, the Spartans narrowly defeated Rutgers by a score of 14–10. MSU finished the regular season 7–5, and went on to lose to Oregon in the Redbox Bowl, 7–6. The 2018 season featured a number of low-scoring games as MSU's stout defense, ranked in the national top ten in six categories, was offset by an oft- struggling offense that finished in the bottom 20 nationally in six categories. 2019 season Despite anemic offensive production in 2018 with scoring offense (18.7 points per game) that ranked 125th out of 129 teams, Dantonio resisted major restructuring of his offense but instead chose to reshuffle the offensive staffs in 2019. Brad Salem, the QB coach in 2018 was promoted to offensive coordinator while Dave Warner and Jim Bollman, the co-offensive coordinators in 2018, were reassigned to be the QB coach and O-line coach respectively. After winning its first two games, Michigan State was ranked #18 in the AP Poll. However, in their third game they fell 10–7 at home to Arizona State. The Spartans had appeared to tie the game with a last- second field goal, but they were penalized for having 12 players on the field and forced to attempt the field goal again from five yards further, which they missed. The following week, MSU defeated Northwestern 31–10 to open its B1G schedule. This gave Dantonio his 110th win as Spartans head coach, surpassing Duffy Daugherty for the most football wins in school history. After defeating Indiana to improve to 4–1, the Spartans' season took a major downturn, losing five games to Ohio State (34–10), Wisconsin (38–0), Penn State (28–7) Illinois (37–34) and Michigan (44–10) consecutively. Against Illinois, the Spartans blew a 28–3 lead in first half and were outscored 27–3 in the fourth quarter at home. The following week at Michigan, the Spartans took an early 7–0 lead in the first quarter but were outscored 44–3 in the final three quarters. In their 12 losses over the 2018-2019 seasons, the Spartans were outscored 139–13 in the fourth quarter. MSU defeated Rutgers (27–0) and Maryland (19–16) in its final two regular season games to finish at 6–6 and achieve bowl eligibility. The 2019 season concluded on December 27 with a 27–21 win over Wake Forest in the Pinstripe Bowl, giving Dantonio his second consecutive 7–6 season. On February 4, 2020, just weeks after accepting a $4.3 million longevity bonus from the university, Mark Dantonio announced he was retiring as head coach. He left the Michigan State football program as its all-time winningest coach with a record of 114–57 and a .667 winning percentage. Personal life Mark Dantonio married his wife, Becky, in 1990. The couple have two daughters, Kristen and Lauren. He is a devout Roman Catholic.

Major League Soccer on ESPN2 debuted in 1996, the league's first season, and is guaranteed to stay on the network till at least 2022. From 1996 to 2006, the weekly soccer match on ESPN2 was called MLS Soccer Saturday, but in the new contract, that was replaced by MLS Primetime Thursday. For the 2009 season and beyond, the Thursday telecast was replaced by a variety of primetime games on Wednesdays through Saturdays. Beginning in 2009, until 2019, as part of ESPN's far-reaching strategy of moving sports programming to ESPN, all matches - including MLS Cup - are now aired on either ESPN or ESPN2. Since 2019, in odd numbered years, the MLS Cup will air on ABC. Regular season games returned to ABC in 2021 (due to Covid-19 pandemic) History On August 4, 2006, ESPN reached a comprehensive multimedia agreement with Soccer United Marketing (SUM) for the rights to Major League Soccer through 2014. As part of the eight-year agreement, ESPN2 will televise 26 regular-season and three playoff MLS matches each year, all in primetime on Thursdays. Highlights of the agreement include: *ESPN2 will televise 26 regular-season MLS matches, primarily on Thursday nights. *ESPN2 will televise three MLS playoff matches. *ABC will televise one regular-season MLS match, the MLS All-Star Game, and MLS Cup. (replaced by ESPN in 2009, until 2017) *Since 2019, ABC will televise the MLS Cup *Televised coverage of the first round of the MLS Draft. *MLS telecasts can be re-aired in full or abbreviated versions on any ESPN media platforms *Extensive footage rights for all ESPN media platforms such as SportsCenter, ESPNEWS, ESPN Motion, ESPN360, etc. *ESPN will also produce and be solely responsible for the content, whereas, they had not been able to do that in the past. 2020 Season Schedule: *ABC will air 10 regular season matches. *ESPN will air 20 regular season matches and the 2020 MLS All-Star Game. *ESPN2 will air 1 regular season match. Also in 2007, ESPN2's coverage of the MLS included new on-screen scoreboards, similar to those used on other sports telecasts. In 2008, another new score graphic was debuted, this time in the upper left hand corner of the screen. ESPN will join forces with Fox Sports and Univision to broadcast over 100 MLS games (combined), live and exclusive, from 2015 and 2022 in its new media rights deal. ESPN has been involved with the league since its inception in 1996. =Technology= In addition, ESPN2 has numerous production enhancements to the telecasts. They include: *SkyCam: A common element during ESPN's NFL and MLB telecasts, SkyCam will return after making its debut in 2005 on select ABC and ESPN2 telecasts. The device provides an aerial view of the field, giving the viewer a unique angle to appreciate the development and speed of match action. *MLS Wired: Telecasts feature use of the unobtrusive microphones, worn by select coaches and players, to capture some of the compelling in-game interactions and conversations. *KickTrax *HD: Beginning in 2007, all games aired in high- definition. =Criticism= ESPN has been accused of putting more emphasis on overall negativity and the more violent aspect of MLS games (such as two confrontations, two challenges and a player nursing a bloody head in its first six shots) in \\"Greatest Highlights of the Month\\" segment for their intermission reports.

This yellow-colored metal carbonyl cluster is an important precursor to organo-osmium compounds. Many of the advances in cluster chemistry have arisen from studies on derivatives of Os3(CO)12 and its lighter analogue Ru3(CO)12. Structure and synthesis The cluster has D3h symmetry, consisting of an equilateral triangle of Os atoms, each of which bears two axial and two equatorial CO ligands. The Os–Os bond distance is 2.88 Â (288 pm).Corey, E. R.; Dahl, L. F. “The Molecular and Crystal Structure of Os3(CO)12” Inorganic Chemistry 1962, volume 1, pages 521–526; . Ru3(CO)12 has the same structure, whereas Fe3(CO)12 is different, with two bridging CO ligands resulting in C2v symmetry. Os3(CO)12 is prepared by the direct reaction of OsO4 with carbon monoxide at 175 °C:Drake, S. R.; Loveday, P. A. “Dodecarbonyltriosmium” Inorganic Syntheses, 1990, volume 28, pages 230–231. . : 3 OsO4 \\\\+ 24 CO -> Os3(CO)12 \\\\+ 12 CO2 The yield is nearly quantitative. Reactions The chemical properties of Os3(CO)12 have been thoroughly examined. Direct reactions of ligands with the cluster often lead to complex product distributions because the inert Os–CO bonds require high temperatures to break, and at such high temperatures the initially formed adducts react further. More successfully, Os3(CO)12 is converted to more labile derivatives such as Os3(CO)11(MeCN) and Os3(CO)10(MeCN)2 using Me3NO as a decarbonylating agent.Nicholls, J. N.; Vargas, M. D. “Some Useful Derivatives of Dodecarbonyltriosmium” Inorganic Syntheses, 1990, volume 28, pages 232–235. . Os3(CO)11(MeCN) reacts with a variety of even weakly basic ligands to form adducts such as Os3(CO)11(ethylene) and Os3(CO)11(pyridine). The direct reaction of Os3(CO)12 with ethylene and pyridine results in degradation of these organic ligands to give the vinyl hydride HOs3(CO)10(η1,η2-C2H3) and the pyridyl-hydride HOs3(CO)10(NC5H4). These products illustrate the stability of Os–H and Os–C bonds. Os3(CO)12 is a platform to examine the ways that hydrocarbons can interact with ensembles of metals. For example, the molecule CH3(H)Os3(CO)10 provided one of the first clear-cut examples of agostic bonding.Calvert, R. B.; Shapley, J. R. “Decacarbonyl(methyl)hydrotriosmium: NMR evidence for a Carbon..Hydrogen..Osmium Interaction” Journal of the American Chemical Society 1978, volume 100, pages 7726–7727; . From the perspective of bonding, the molecule H2Os3(CO)10 is noteworthy. In this compound, the two hydride ligands bridge one Os-Os edge. The molecule displays reactivity reminiscent of diborane.Keister, J. B.; Shapley, J.

Jameson is known for his pioneering work in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics. He has published more than 300 scientific papers (authored or co-authored) in a wide range of areas including computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and control theory. Early life Born in Gillingham, Kent, UK Jameson spent much of his early childhood in India where his father was stationed as a British Army Officer. He first attended school at St. Edward's School, Shimla. Subsequently, he was educated in England at Mowden Hall School and Winchester College. Jameson served as a lieutenant in the British Army in 1953–1955, and was sent to Malaya. On coming out of the army he worked in the compressor design section of Bristol Aero-Engines in the summer of 1955, before studying engineering at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Jameson graduated with first class honours in 1958. Subsequently, he stayed on at Cambridge to obtain a PhD in Magnetohydrodynamics, and he was a Research Fellow of Trinity Hall from 1960 to 1963. Career in the UK On leaving Cambridge he worked as an economist for the Trades Union Congress in 1964–1965. He then became Chief Mathematician at Hawker Siddeley in Coventry. Career in the United States In 1966, Jameson joined the Aerodynamics Section of Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation in Bethpage, New York. In this period, his work was largely directed toward the application of automatic control theory to stability augmentation systems. Starting in 1970, he began to concentrate on the problem of predicting transonic flow. Existing numerical methods were not equal to the task, and it was clear that new methods would have to be developed. At that time limitations in computer capabilities also precluded any attempt to calculate the flow past a complete aircraft, but useful efforts could be made for simpler configurations such as airfoils and wings. In 1972 Jameson moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, where he continued his work on transonic flow. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of Computer Science at New York University. He joined Princeton University in 1980, and in 1982 he was appointed James Smith McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He was Director of the University's Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics from 1986 to 1988. He was a Professor of Engineering in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 1997–2015, Stanford University. He is currently TEES Eminent Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M; University. Computational fluid dynamics methods During his career, Professor Jameson has devised a variety of new schemes for solving the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for inviscid and viscous compressible flows. For example, he devised a multigrid-scheme for the solution of steady flow problems and the dual time stepping scheme for unsteady flows. Jameson also wrote the FLO and SYN series of computer programs which have been widely used in the aircraft industry. Awards In 1980 he received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in recognition of his earlier work on transonic potential flow. In 1988 he received the Gold Medal of the British Royal Aeronautical Society for his outstanding contribution to the development of methods for the calculation of transonic flow over real aircraft configurations. In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and he was also elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

He was Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in 1947, fourth in line to the governorship, when the governor, secretary of state, and senate president were all killed in a plane crash. He served as the 24th Governor of Oregon for just over one year. Early life and education Hall was born in Portland, the son of John Hicklin Hall, who served as Oregon's District Attorney. He attended Lincoln and Jefferson high schools in Portland, and Culver Military Academy in Indiana. He graduated from Oregon State University in 1923 with a business administration degree. During World War I, he served in the United States Navy as a medical corpsman, and upon his return home, held a variety of jobs before entering Portland's Northwestern School of Law (now a part of Lewis & Clark College), and was admitted to the bar in 1926. He married Elizabeth Walch on December 28, 1926, with whom he had two children before her death in 1937. He and Alyce Johnson married on December 31, 1941 and had one child. In his practice, Hall specialized in corporate and business, representing many corporate clients, including liquor interests, which would play a role in his later political career. He had joined his father's firm in 1926, and upon the elder Hall's retirement, joined the Bowermann law firm in 1932, and later moved to Lincoln City, Oregon, and opened a private practice. Political career Hall was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives (elected 1932, 1938, 1942, 1944, 1946) becoming Speaker in 1947. On October 28, 1947, Governor Earl Snell was killed in a plane crash along with the next in line of succession, President of the Senate Marshall E. Cornett. As second in line of succession, Hall became and served as Governor of Oregon until a 1948 special election could be held to elect a governor to complete the term. (In 1972, Oregon Ballot Measure 8 added the Oregon Secretary of State as first in line of succession; however, since Secretary of State Robert S. Farrell, Jr. was also killed in this crash, the result would have been the same.) During Hall's short tenure as governor, he sought to adjust wages and salaries of state employees for inflation, was a strong supporter of education, and favored a plan to allocate state surpluses on construction projects for higher educational and other state institutions. From the beginning, Hall's administration was marked by controversy regarding his attempts to liberalize the state's regulation of the liquor industry. He sought to reorganize the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which he had felt had been arbitrary and non-judicial in its decisions when he had represented clients before it, and unresponsive to the legislature during his tenure as a State Representative. The issue came to a head with his dismissal of a commission member who had publicly disagreed with the governor over removing limits on the purchase of liquor. During the height of the controversy, State Senator Douglas McKay, a friend of late Governor Snell, and president of the Automobile Dealer's Association, announced that he would challenge Hall in the 1948 Republican primary, and quickly launched a well-financed and organized campaign. A contentious race ensued, in which charges of conflicts of interest and immorality were brought to bear against Hall because of his liquor industry ties. Hall lost the nomination to McKay by a statewide vote of 103,224 to 107,993. Later life After leaving office as governor, Hall moved to Lincoln County, Oregon, to practice law. He served one term as an Oregon district judge, (elected 1965), overcame throat cancer, and after a short period of semi-retirement, died in Newport on November 14, 1970.

History  Despite many proposals, few hash functions based on modular arithmetic have withstood attack, and most that have tend to be relatively inefficient. MASH-1 evolved from a long line of related proposals successively broken and repaired.  Standard  Committee Draft ISO/IEC 10118-4 (Nov 95)  Description  MASH-1 involves use of an RSA-like modulus N, whose bitlength affects the security. N is a product of two prime numbers and should be difficult to factor, and for N of unknown factorization, the security is based in part on the difficulty of extracting modular roots. Let L be the length of a message block in bit. N is chosen to have a binary representation a few bits longer than L, typically L < N \\\\leq L+16. The message is padded by appending the message length and is separated into blocks D_1, \\\\cdots, D_q of length L/2. From each of these blocks D_i, an enlarged block B_i of length L is created by placing four bits from D_i in the lower half of each byte and four bits of value 1 in the higher half. These blocks are processed iteratively by a compression function: :H_0 = IV :H_i = f(B_i, H_{i-1}) = ((((B_i \\\\oplus H_{i-1}) \\\\vee E)^e \\\\bmod N) \\\\bmod 2^L) \\\\oplus H_{i-1}; \\\\quad i=1,\\\\cdots,q Where E=15 \\\\cdot 2^{L-4} and e=2. \\\\vee denotes the bitwise OR and \\\\oplus the bitwise XOR. From H_q are now calculated more data blocks D_{q+1},\\\\cdots,D_{q+8} by linear operations (where \\\\ denotes concatenation): :H_q = Y_1 \\\\,\\\\\\\\, Y_3 \\\\,\\\\\\\\, Y_0 \\\\,\\\\\\\\, Y_2; \\\\quad Y_i = L/4 :Y_i = Y_{i-1} \\\\oplus Y_{i-4}; \\\\quad i=4,\\\\cdots,15 :D_{q+i} = Y_{2i-2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\, Y_{2i-1}; \\\\quad i=1,\\\\cdots,8 These data blocks are now enlarged to B_{q+1},\\\\cdots,B_{q+8} like above, and with these the compression process continues with eight more steps: :H_i = f(B_i, H_{i-1}); \\\\quad i=q+1,\\\\cdots,q+8 Finally the hash value is H_{q+8} \\\\bmod p, where p is a prime number with 7\\\\cdot 2^{L/2-3} < p < 2^{L/2}.Smashing MASH-1, Vladimir Antipkin  MASH-2  There is a newer version of the algorithm called MASH-2 with a different exponent. The original e=2 is replaced by e=2^8+1. This is the only difference between these versions.  References  * A. Menezes, P. van Oorschot, S.

Detailed Service The 30th Wisconsin Infantry was recruited under the call of July, 1862, for 300,000 men. The first man to enlist was James Berry of Company D, on July 21, 1862. Enlistments closed on August 23, 1862, with a full regiment of 1020 men. Many of the enlistment papers were made out for the Twenty-fifth Regiment, but volunteering was so brisk that thirteen full regiments were raised from the 21st to the 33rd Wisconsin, inclusive, within thirty days from the call. The average age of the men was twenty-five years and six months; their average height was 5 ft. 7 7–10 inches. Many were lumbermen, farmers and miners, and a number were Indians from the Chippewa Reservation. Nearly 90% were born in the United States. The regiment was mustered into the United States service, October 18, 1862, at Camp Randall, near Madison, Wisconsin. As mustered in, the regiment was composed as follows: * Company A, Captain Samuel Harriman, from St. Croix, Polk and Pierce Counties * Company B, Captain Lewis S. Burton, from Iowa and Lafayette Counties * Company C, Captain A. A. Arnold, from Trempealeau County * Company D, Captain David С. Fulton, from St. Croix, Polk and Pierce Counties * Company E, Captain Edward Devlin, from Iowa and Lafayette Counties * Company F, Captain Martin A. Driebelbis, from Pierce County * Company G, Captain Asa B. Swain, from Waushara County * Company H, Captain Andrew Bedal, from Waushara County * Company I, Captain Napoleon B. Greer, from Eau Claire County * Company K, Captain John Klatt, from Chippewa County Subsequently, regimental headquarters remained at Camp Randall, while portions of the regiment were almost constantly detached in the performance of various kinds of duty. On May 2, 1863, companies D, F, I and K, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Bartlett, were ordered to the upper Missouri River, to support the Indian expedition under General Alfred Sully. These companies served with this command at different points on the river, from Sioux City, Iowa, to Fort Pierre, Dakota Territory, until the August 10, 1863, when companies I and К were ordered to report at Camp Washburn, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, leaving companies D and F at Fort Pierre; these companies arrived at Milwaukee on September 12, 1863. On the May 26, companies G and E left Camp Randall, the former for Superior, Wis., and the latter for Bayfield, Wisconsin, in anticipation of trouble with the Indians at these points. They remained at these stations, respectively, until the middle of August, when they were recalled; arrived on August 31 at Camp Washburn, which was placed under command of Major John Clowney, of this regiment. The remaining companies, at various times, were sent to various parts of the state to maintain order during the enrollment and draft, under the Conscription Act. Colonel Daniel J. Dill was Post Commandant at Camp Randall during this time. In the December, 1863, the regiment was transferred to Camp Washburn, and subsequently to Camp Reno, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where the headquarters of the regiment were established.

Embarking on steamboats at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, on October 20, they descended the Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri, where they arrived on October 26, and were quartered in Benton Barracks. They left St. Louis on the October 29, and arrived the next day at Paducah, Kentucky, at the mouth of the Tennessee River. Here they were employed in guard duty until December 6, 1864, when they again embarked and proceeding up the Ohio River, landed at Louisville December 10, where they rejoined the balance of the regiment, with the exception of Co. I, which still remained at Fort Union, Dakota Territory. On the December 12, 1864, the nine companies of the Thirtieth left Louisville by rail, and next day went into camp at Bowling Green, Kentucky.

History The model, introduced early 1994 (UL70 series also called U412-220 UL70) and produced until 2002, was mostly used in Bucharest's bus network operated by RATB even though some U 412-260s are also used in other Romanian cities such as Braşov, Cluj-Napoca, Galati, Craiova, and Oradea.Autobuze Rocar de Simon U 412-220Buses Rocar DeSimon in Bucharest Rocar De Simon buses also were used by the army and the MAI. Used as a coach, it was also equipped with air conditioning, and it had 2 doors (front and mid). Also some Rocar De Simon buses were sold to some particulars, mainly versions with 2 doors, but also with 3 doors. 2-door versions are also available with a slightly shorter wheelbase. Rocar De Simon was built in 7 versions: U412-220 UL70, U412-220, U412-230, U412-260, U412E (trolleybus), U412 DAF (with DAF platform), and some 2-door versions based on U412-260, with slightly lower wheelbase. RATB has withdrawn all of them from service (including trolleybus 7454), because some of them were severely worn out, but also because RATB wanted to operate solely low floor busses with air conditioning. The only vehicle remaining operational at RATB based on Rocar De Simon is trolleybus #7459. Some of them were scrapped (the most severely worn out), but some of them are still in some garages of RATB, not in regular use for public transport, they are used for internal purposes or are proposed either for scrapping or sale. A major problem RATB discovered at these buses after a few years of operation, was the broken chassis, either the rear console was bending, either some busses were bending at the mid, probably because frequently overloading them. It is one of the main reasons RATB removed them from regular service, apart from the fact that RATB wanted solely low floor buses. RATB removed Rocar De Simon buses from operation in mid to late 2011. All of them were replaced with low floor buses, Mercedes-Benz Citaro type. Rocar De Simon was quite a modern vehicle at its time, actual design, having MAN Euro 2 engines, automatic transmission (although vehicles with manual transmission also existed), ABS, electronic controlled air suspension (ECAS), tubeless tires (although some were delivered with tube type wheel assembly), Fluorescent lighting of the saloon, plastic (sometimes with upholstery) seats, Blaupunkt sound system with public address with bus vox system announcing the stations, electrical ventilating rooftops, heated saloon, STOP button in the saloon (for announcing the driver to stop at some desired stations) and some safety features (like hammer for crashing the windows in case of fire), and many of them were equipped with electronic display (few of them were even equipped with luminescent display). Despite this advantages, it didn't proved very successful, mainly due to low number of manufactured vehicles, as only about 400 vehicles were manufactured between 1994 and 2002 (taking in consideration all its versions (220, 230, 260) and derivate vehicles – coach, trolleybus, shorter wheelbase version), and probably by concurrence (mainly second hand vehicles but also some new busses) and high price. However, it was bought in low numbers by other public transport companies around Romania and some particulars. It had no successor because ROCAR went bankrupt, although its successors were meant to be either Rocar 812 series (built on BusOtto Autodromo platform) only one bus and one trolleybus were made in 1998, or ROCAR SOLARIS URBINO in 2002 (the last attempt before ROCAR went bankrupt, only one piece was spotted, but unknown if it was badged ROCAR or it was really built by ROCAR). Rocar De Simon was meant to be the successor of DAC/Rocar 112/212 and 117/217 series based on the older Roman 112 UD, but they continued the production of the later in parallel with De Simon until 2000. De Simon bus series, although originally had an articulated version, ROCAR never built articulated De Simon. It was the last bus ever made by ROCAR, its production ceased in 2002 some months before ROCAR officially declared Bankruptcy. Unlike Rocar 112/117/212/217 series which were exported to some countries, Rocar De Simon was not officially exported (at least no model is known to be sold outside Romania). All built vehicles, were delivered and operated in Romania. Rocar de Simon busses (so for Rocar 812 BusOtto Autodromo) were unaffected by the bankruptcy of its mother factory, ROCAR, compared to many other ROCAR products (apart from the fact they were outdated), as spare parts were (and sometimes are) widely available, because it was produced with components also used by many other manufacturers, some of them being interchangeable. Body parts like panels, glasses, tail lights and headlights could be brought from Italy or other countries which were operating De Simon Buses. Subtypes * Rocar De Simon U412-220 UL70: It was operated only by RATB, and there were 6 vehicles. It can be easily recognized by the window under the windshield, on the right side. It was equipped with MAN engine, 220 Hp, Automatic transmission, and rear axle was IABV. It had no electronic display, only with painted board. Stood at Militari Garage. First series of Rocar De Simon, built in 1994. * Rocar De Simon U412-220 and U412-230: mainly the same with U412-220 UL70, or slightly more powerful engine, 230 hp at U412-230. Had electronic display, like UL70 had the front spoiler built from 2 sections, and some of them had the front spoiler painted orange (mostly U412-220). Stood at Militari garage, and operated solely by RATB. The window under the windshield which was present on UL70 was removed. Built between early 1995 and late 1996. Craiova also received 2 Rocar De Simon U412-230. * Rocar De Simon U412-260: the most popular version of Rocar De Simon, and the most numerous, operated by several other transport companies in Romania, but RATB was its main operator. Rear axle is RABA type with no gear reducer, it is equipped with WABCO ABS. Front spoiler built in one piece. Like other Rocar De Simons, it had Electronic Controlled Air Suspension, leaning a little when doors ere open to facilitate getting in and out. This version was also sent to Brasov (1 vehicle), Galati (2 vehicles), Cluj (6 vehicles), Oradea (5 vehicles), built from late 1996 to 2002. Also sold to some particulars. To be mentioned that vehicles with manual transmission also existed. * Rocar De Simon U412-DAF: only two versions built, operated solely by RATB; can be easily recognized by shorter wheelbase * Rocar De Simon U412E: Trolleybus version, only 19 built, between mid 1997 and 2002. Rear axle is the same with De Simon U412-220/230, and has an engine of 125-150 kW. Operated by RATB (Bucharest) - 2 vehicles (one with chopper, one with AC Motor and Kiepe Electric Equipment), RATUC (Cluj Napoca) - 2 vehicles, RATC (Constanta, not equipped with CHOPPER!) - 15 vehicles, Piatra Neamt (5 vehicles - from Constanta). * Rocar De Simon U412-260 2 doors, painted green. 2 vehicles were spotted, one belongs to MAI, ARMY, used as coach, equipped with A/C, the other was a particular bus. It had a slightly shorter wheelbase than 3-doors model and 2 doors (front and mid). Probably built as custom vehicle or designed for interurban lines, however no such vehicle is known to be operated by any public transport company in Romania.

In 1997, Farmer won the Newbery Honor for the novel, which was also a finalist for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature. The book explores the qualities needed to survive in a hostile environment (particularly by a woman), coming-of-age and the availability of spiritual guidance. Plot Nhamo is an 11-year-old girl living in a traditional Shona village located in Mozambique around 1981. She was raised with the knowledge and customs of her tribe. Nhamo means \\"disaster\\" in the Shona language. Nhamo was given this name because of the scandal and wrongful things continued to follow her and her mother. After experiencing trouble with a cholera epidemic, a leopard, and an arranged marriage proposed by a false witch doctor, she flees with her dying grandmother's blessings, some gold nuggets, and her meager survival skills. Nhamo steals a boat and supplies under her grandmother's instructions and uses the river as her road to Zimbabwe, where she faces the threat of hippos, crocodiles, and other animals trying to kill her, while dealing with the pressures of becoming a woman. What should have been a two-day boat trip across the border to her father's family in Zimbabwe spans a year in which Nhamo faces starvation and the threat of hungry or aggressive animals. The girl finds her way to a lush, haunted island and lives alongside a troop of baboons. Daily conversations with spirits combat Nhamo's loneliness and provide her with sage and practical advice. She makes mistakes, loses heart, and nearly dies of starvation. Even after she arrives in Zimbabwe where she lives with scientists before meeting her father's family, Nhamo must learn how to live in a modern society (clothing, behavior, literacy), and is urged to let go of the \\"evil\\" spirits that \\"possess\\" her as prescribed by a Muvuki or witch finder. Characters *Nhamo Jongwe: The girl named \\"Disaster\\". She got her name due to the many disasters she faces during her life, even as a child. However, Nhamo is resourceful and clever, in spite of the bad luck she supposedly causes. *Aunt Chipo: Nhamo's bad tempered aunt, who has resented Runako, Nhamo's deceased mother and Chipo's older sister, since they were children. She has hated Nhamo and her mother ever since she was born and forces her to do most of the work in the village, allowing her daughter, Masvita, to do the less strenuous tasks. *Masvita: Nhamo's sweet tempered cousin, who behaves respectfully towards Nhamo, in spite of how mean-spirited her mother is. *Aunt Shuvai: Nhamo's younger aunt. She is considerably more ambivalent to Nhamo. *Uncle Kufa: Nhamo's uncle and Aunt Chipo's husband. He is a pragmatic man. *Ruva: Aunt Chipo′s second daughter. *Ambuya: Nhamo and Masvita's grandmother. She treats Nhamo with respect and loves her dearly, and is one of the few people to do so. Chipo resents her mother, believing that Ambuya favoured Runako (Nhamo's mother) for doing well in school and Shuvai, who was the youngest of Ambuya's three daughters. *Crocodile Guts: A fisherman *Sister Gladys: A nurse who takes care of Nhamo in the later part of the book. * Goré Mtoko : Killed by Nhamo's father * Muvuki : the witch finder See also *The Ear, the Eye, and the Arm References Category:1996 American novels Category:American children's novels Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:Novels set in Mozambique Category:American bildungsromans Category:Novels about survival skills Category:1996 children's books ","title":"A Girl Named Disaster"},{"id":"7655915","text":"WKXB (\\"Jammin' 99.9\\") is a Rhythmic Oldies formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Boiling Spring Lakes, North Carolina and serving the Wilmington, North Carolina area.

The association organized more than 7,000 teachers, musicians, producers, and others interested in jazz, from more than thirty countries. They organized a yearly conference, which included numerous musical presentations. IAJE filed for bankruptcy April 2008, and ceased as a corporation March 15, 2009. The bankruptcy filing was necessitated, in part, because of financial problems stemming from a lack of donations, and losses - notably from the small turnout at the Toronto conference of 2008.

The square is a significant transport hub, containing the Piața Unirii metro station and a major interchange for RATB buses; there is also a tram terminal near the southwest corner. The Unirea Shopping Center, the Cocor department store and a large taxi rank are located on the east side of this square, while Hanul lui Manuc is on the north side, near the northeast corner. The centre of the square boasts a small park and fountains which are particularly popular with commuters and passers-by in the torrid summer months. There were plans to build the Romanian National Salvation Cathedral on the place of this park, but the idea proved technically impossible due to the busy underground environment and lack of popularity among local citizens and therefore the location was changed. The square features a large Christmas tree erected every December.

The crumbling of the empires had a great effect on the Ukrainian nationalist movement, and in a short period of four years a number of Ukrainian governments sprang up. This period was characterized by optimism and by nation-building, as well as by chaos and civil war. Matters stabilized somewhat in 1921 with the territory of modern-day Ukraine divided between Soviet Ukraine (which would become a constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922) and Poland, and with small ethnic-Ukrainian regions belonging to Czechoslovakia and to Romania.  Alliance and strife  Ukraine according to an old postal stamp from 1919. February 1918 article from The New York Times showing a map of the Imperial Russian territories claimed by Ukraine People’s Republic at the time, before the annexation of the Austro- Hungarian lands of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. The Ukraine depicted on this map is a rump state that the German led armies of the Central Powers had removed from Russian domination just before the March 3, 1918, signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk granting Ukraine independence from Russia. On April 29, 1918, the Ukrainian People's Republic was dissolved. Ukrainia's borders drawn up at Brest-Litovsk. After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, Ukrainian community leaders were able finally to organized the Central Rada in Kyiv (Tsentral’na rada), headed by Mykhailo Hrushevsky. They sought an approval of the Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd (St Petersburg) to establish a regional government. The Central Rada consisted of various political parties such as Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionary, Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party, Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, General Jewish Labor Bund, Polish national party, representatives of Army, peasantry, workers, and others. It quickly gained the support of elements of the Imperial Army in Ukraine. On June 23, 1917, the Central Rada issued its First Universal, declaring Ukrainian autonomy within a Russian federation, which was enthusiastically supported by the First All-Ukrainian Peasant Congress on June 28. Shortly after the early-November Bolshevik coup in Petrograd and a similar event in Kyiv, the Central Rada issued the Third Universal on November 20, 1917, declaring a Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) in Kyiv and condemning the Bolsheviks initiated disorder in Petrograd as politically illegal. Because the legal government in Petrograd was dissolved, the Central Rada had no other choice but to declare its autonomy with its own regional government that was previously approved by the Russian Provisional Government. The UNR refused to recognize the newly installed Soviet government, which in turn caused a tension within the Central Rada. The Bolshevik government demanded an all-Russian union. The Bolsheviks faction convened an All-Ukrainian Congress of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Soviets in Kyiv in December demanding recognition of Sovnarkom from the Central Rada. Finding themselves to be a small minority at the congress of 2,500 delegates, the 100 Bolsheviks and a few others left to join a congress of local deputies in Kharkiv which they renamed the All-Ukrainian Congress of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Soviets. They declared the Bolshevik government of Ukraine (Respublyka Rad Ukrayiny) on December 25, 1917 and claimed that the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic were outlaws. Upon taking over the government in Petrograd, the Bolsheviks immediately sued for peace with the Central Powers. After more than two months of negotiations, the Bolsheviks led by Joffe signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, a peace treaty between Russia and the Central Powers, on March 3, 1918. This treaty granted Ukraine independence from Russian control. An independent Ukraine was not a popular notion among Russians. An independent Ukraine coupled with the 1918 Russian great hunger greatly weakened the leadership of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia. Ukraine continued to gain territory after the treaty was signed because the armies of the Central Powers pushed deeper into Russia, thus freeing more Ukrainians from Russian control especially in the Kuban and in the lands of the Don Cossacks and the Terek Cossacks all of which contained very large Ukrainian populations. By late spring 1918, Ukraine with support from the Central Powers had gained control of the lower Volga River and began to receive oil shipments from Baku through the Volga ports of Tsaritsyn and Saratov. The Cossacks fiercely abhorred Bolshevism. After the July 6, 1918, assassination in Moscow of the German Ambassador to Russia Count Mirbach, many Bolsheviks who resented the terms of the peace treaty began guerrilla warfare and genocide with very strong support from Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka. In late 1917 to early 1918, the UNR for couple of months lost Kyiv to the Bolsheviks, but the UNR with Central Powers support controlled of much of Ukraine, pushed the Bolsheviks out of Kyiv on March 1, 1918, and forced the Bolsheviks to convene their government in Taganrog, Russia, on the coast of the Sea of Azov. The Congress of Free Hubb'andmen on April 29, 1918 (with the great support of Austrian-German occupants), elected tsarist general P.P.Skoropadsky as Hetman of Ukraine. He proclaimed the overthrow of the Central Rada Government thus suspending the UNR and also outlawed the Communist Party in Ukraine. After the socialist Directorate of Ukraine overthrew the Hetman's government and then reestablished the UNR on November 13–14, 1918, the Bolsheviks forces with support from Moscow renewed their aggression claiming to be led by the government of Ukraine. Ukraine sent a note of protest requesting to cease the hostilities; Sovnarkom first ignored the request and later stated that it has nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government declared a war on January 16, 1919. The Bolsheviks amid fluid alliances with various anarchists would eventually defeat the Ukrainian army that was fighting on several fronts simultaneously. Meanwhile, the Western Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR) was declared in Lviv on October 19, 1918. Within the ZUNR were the largest oil reserves in Europe. The ZUNR formally (and largely symbolically) joined the UNR in hope to gain some support in the war against Poland. A UNR delegation sent to Paris could not gain recognition at the Treaty of Versailles at the end of the World War. UNR forces fared poorly during Polish-Soviet War and a late alliance with Poland wasn't enough to secure the republic. After the Polish-Soviet Peace of Riga, Ukrainian territory found itself split among the Ukrainian SSR in the center, Poland in the west, and Crimea, Kuban, and the former Cossacks lands became southern Russia in the east. Carpathian Ruthenia found itself in Czechoslovakia, and Bukovina in Romania. Ukraine was a rump state of its former self. In December 1922, with Bolsheviks secure in their power over its territory, Soviet Ukraine joined the Russian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian republics to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  International involvements The chaotic conditions in Ukraine attracted attention from the major powers. Canadian scholar Orest Subtelny provides a context from the long span of European history: : In 1919 total chaos engulfed Ukraine. Indeed, in the modern history of Europe no country experienced such complete anarchy, bitter civil strife, and total collapse of authority as did Ukraine at this time. Six different armies-– those of the Ukrainians, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the Entente [French], the Poles and the anarchists – operated on its territory. Kyiv changed hands five times in less than a year. Cities and regions were cut off from each other by the numerous fronts. Communications with the outside world broke down almost completely. The starving cities emptied as people moved into the countryside in their search for food. Outside powers acted on entirely different visions for Ukraine. The British ridiculed the pretensions of the new nation. White Russians, united only by their opposition to Bolshevism, wanted to restore Ukraine as a Russian province. Russian Bolsheviks did not believe in nationalism and twice invaded Ukraine and failed efforts to seize control and collectivize the farms; they succeeded the third time in 1920. Americans were outraged at the large-scale massacres of Jews in 1919. Germany supported Ukrainian nationalism as a foil to Russia, but its chief goal was to obtain urgently needed food supplies. Ukraine was too poorly organized to fulfill the promised food shipments.Wolfram Dornik and Peter Lieb. \\"Misconceived realpolitik in a failing state: the political and economical fiasco of the Central Powers in the Ukraine, 1918.\\" First World War Studies 4.1 (2013): 111-124. Poland wanted Ukraine in order to build a population that could stand up against Germany. France wanted Poland as a strong anti-German ally and therefore supported Polish ambitions. Poland did seize Ukraine in 1919, but was driven out in the Polish–Soviet War in 1920.Oleksandr Pavliuk, \\"Ukrainian-Polish relations in Galicia in 1918-1919.\\" Journal of Ukrainian Studies 23.1 (1998)  Ukrainian governments (1917–1920)  * Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic: March 17, 1917 – April 29, 1918. * Hetmanate of the Ukrainian State: April 29, 1918 – December 14, 1918. * Ukrainian National Council of the West Ukrainian People's Republic: October 18, 1918 – January 22, 1919 (de facto independent until July 1919). * Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic: November 14, 1918 – 1920.

Life Tsutaumi Hōzan was the twelfth disciple of the famed monk Jion. Jion had fourteen disciples, each in a separate region of Japan to spread his art, Nen ryū, across the country. Hōzan was said to have been an adept at fighting with the jitte, even at a young age. Hōzan was also proficient at the art of jujutsu, which was a significant part of his Hōzan-ryū. Although his teacher, Jion, died before Hōzan had learned all of Nen ryū's basics (\\"techniques of the past\\"), he is said to have mastered its teaching (\\"techniques of the future\\") due to his ability with the jitte, which is simpler to wield than a sword, as the jitte is a single handed weapon. It is believed that Hōzan, or one of his disciples had transmitted the art of the jitte to Hirata Shokan, Miyamoto Musashi's grandfather. It is for this reason the Miyamoto family taught the art of the jitte for many generations. Musashi himself is said to have learned Jion's Nen ryū through Hōzan's jitte, which would have greatly influenced the single- handed method of Musashi's Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū.

The Spartans rallied to score 38 unanswered points to beat the Wildcats 41–38 after falling behind 38–3 with 9:54 left in the 3rd quarter. First quarter Michigan State started the game with a 66-yard drive that ended with a Brett Swenson 32-yard field goal. Northwestern's first drive ended with quarterback C. J. Bachér finding Ross Lane for a 5-yard touchdown that gave the Wildcats a 7–3 lead. Second quarter The Wildcats' first drive of the second quarter resulted in Bachér rushing for a 2-yard touchdown. The Spartans were forced to punt on the ensuing drive. Northwestern's Joel Howells kicked a 30-yard field goal on the next drive. On the following drive, Michigan State was once again forced to punt. After the punt, Northwestern scored another touchdown on a Brandon Roberson 18-yard pass to Shaun Herbert. Michigan State's woes continued on their next drive, when they fumbled the football. However, Howells missed a 36-yard field goal at the end of the first half. Third quarter Northwestern began the third quarter with an 80-yard drive that resulted in a Bachér 22-yard touchdown pass to Lane. On the first play of the next drive, Drew Stanton was intercepted. Northwestern capitalized on the great field position with Herbert catching a 5-yard touchdown pass, giving Northwestern a 38–3 lead. Michigan State began the comeback with a nine play, 65 yard drive that was capped off with an 18-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Stanton to running back Jehuu Caulcrick. Following a Northwestern punt, Michigan State scored again, finishing an eight play, 53-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run from A.J. Jimmerson. On the ensuing drive, the Wildcats had gained 69 yards in only 5 plays when Bachér was intercepted at the goal line by Michigan State middle linebacker Kaleb Thornhill. The quarter ended with the Spartans down 38–17. Fourth quarter Michigan State's chances of completing the comeback appeared to be finished early in the fourth quarter when backup quarterback Brian Hoyer had his 6th pass of the drive intercepted by Northwestern a minute in. However, after failing to convert a short third down at midfield, the Wildcats had their punt blocked by Devin Thomas and returned for a touchdown by Ashton Henderson. Northwestern's next two drives also ended in punts, and each ensuing Spartan drive resulted in a touchdown. With the score tied at 38, the Wildcats had the ball on their own 15 yard line with 3:32 left in regulation. On the first play of the series, Bachér was intercepted by the Spartans' Travis Key at the Northwestern 40. The interception was returned to the 30 yard line. The Spartans ran the ball for the duration of the drive, advancing the ball to Northwestern's 11 yard line with 18 seconds left. MSU kicker Swenson hit a 28-yard field goal to give the Spartans the lead. The Wildcats would get the ball one more time, returning the ensuing kickoff to their own 37 yard line. Following an offsides penalty which moved the ball to the 42 yard line, Northwestern's final play for the end zone was unsuccessful and the Spartans won 41–38. Fallout Michigan State had started the season off 3–0, including an impressive win over Pittsburgh. In their next game against Notre Dame, they lost despite leading by 16 entering the 4th quarter. Their next 3 games were losses to Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio State. The comeback was thought to save John L. Smith's career at Michigan State, but on November 1, 2006, the university announced that Smith would not be brought back after the season as the Spartans finished with four more losses after this game. Northwestern, by contrast, had already fallen out of bowl contention.

Tousard wrote two very influential books: one was a proposal for a school for officers that became the blueprint for West Point, and the other was a manual for artillery officers that became standard in the young army.. Biography Educated at the Strasbourg school of artillery,. Tousard served with the Continental Army between 1777-1778 and lost an arm due to wound received in the Battle of Rhode Island. He was decorated with the Order of Saint Louis on his return to France. After being briefly imprisoned during the French Revolution in 1793 at Prison de l'Abbaye, he returned to the US in 1795 where he received a commission as a major in the 2nd U.S. Artillery Regiment in the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers. By 1800 he was a lieutenant colonel and Inspector of Artillery. As the Inspector, he supervised the construction of several forts in Eastern seaboard of the US, and the construction and testing of cannons. His influence with George Washington was instrumental in the establishment of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1802, initially to train engineers and artillerists, with a curriculum modeled after that of the École Polytechnique. After retiring from US service he served France in military and diplomatic capacities. In 1809 he published The American Arillerist's Companion, or Elements of Artillery,. a book that became the basic manual for US artillerymen. Influence on armory and manufacturing His greatest influence was that he promoted Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval's idea of interchangeable parts for guns. The War Department then set up the armories at Springfield and Harpers Ferry, which set out to perfect the idea. Despite the claims of Eli Whitney, who failed to deliver on his original 1798 contract until 1809 and who never achieved interchangeability, the American system of manufacturing was not perfected until inside contractor Captain John H. Hall realized it with the M1819 Hall rifle. Historian David A. Hounshell said, Other military contributions Major de Tousard also designed Fort Adams and Fort Hamilton in Newport, Rhode Island.

Settle began his musical career as a solo singer and a member of The New Christy Minstrels. His debut solo album Folk Sing Hallelujah (1961) as Mike Settle and the Settlers, received good reviews and the title track \\"Sing Hallelujah\\" was covered on singles by several artists in Europe, as well as being a hit for Judy Collins (1967). His song \\"Settle Down (Goin' Down That Highway)\\" was recorded by Peter, Paul and Mary on their 1963 album Moving, and was the second single released from that album. Settle is best known for being a member of Kenny Rogers and The First Edition between 1967 and 1970. While he was with the group he composed a number of songs, including \\"But You Know I Love You\\" (a No. 19 pop hit in 1969), as well as \\"It's Gonna Be Better\\", \\"The Last Few Threads Of Love\\" and \\"Goodtime Liberator\\", among many others. He was later a member of the group Running Bear and Goldstein which recorded the original song \\"Rings\\", popularized by Cymarron (1971) and Lobo (1974). He also contributed three songs to the soundtrack of the 1971 cult classic movie Vanishing Point. In 1971 Settle sang lead on a song which was distributed as a cardboard cut-out record (version #2) attached to the back of hundreds of thousands Post Sugar Crisp cereal boxes: \\"You Are The One\\" by the Sugar Bears, a studio project involving Settle, producer Jimmy Bowen, Kim Carnes, Baker Knight, and others. An album, Presenting the Sugar Bears, and three singles were released on Big Tree Records, with \\"You Are The One\\" eventually peaking at No. 51 on the Billboard pop chart in April 1972. In addition to his own album releases, Settle was credited over the years variously as a producer, arranger, vocalist, and musician on albums by Kim Carnes, John Stewart, Glenn Yarbrough, and the Kingston Trio.

Nobuharu had very treasured many technique illustrated drawings of Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, the founder of the Shinkage ryu. Nobuharu had elaborated to many notable swordsmen during the period, such as Morita Monjuro the current transmission of his descended art. Nobuharu had said that the difference between the present day art of the sword greatly differed from the time of Nobutsuna's life when people had fought within armor. Nobuharu had shown that the art of the sword had seemed to be more lax because the present-day warriors wore more ordinary clothing, not armor that would need a powerful among of energy to break through. During the time of Nobuharu's teachings, subtlety became considered as being more important that strength.

The running of all internal combustion engines is dependent on the ignition quality of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating. For diesel engines it depends on the type of fuel, for distillate fuels the cetane numbers are used. Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used: CCAI and Calculated Ignition Index (CII). Both CCAI and CII are calculated from the density and kinematic viscosity of the fuel. Definition Formula for CCAI: CCAI=D-140.7 \\\\log (\\\\log (V+0.85))-80.6-210 \\\\ln \\\\left (\\\\frac{t+273}{323} \\\\right ) which is equivalent to: CCAI=D-140.7 \\\\log (\\\\log (V+0.85))-80.6-483.5 \\\\log \\\\left (\\\\frac{t+273}{323} \\\\right ) Where: D= density at 15°C (kg/m3) V= viscosity (cST) t = viscosity temperature (°C) Use This will normally give a value somewhere between 800 and 880. The lower the value is the better the ignition quality. Fuels with a CCAI higher than 880 are often problematic or even unusable in a diesel engine. CCAI are often calculated under testing of marine fuel. In case of high CCAI, the manufacturers recommendations and guidance limits should be consulted to ensure that the fuel falls within the permissible range for the engine type. Attention should be given to the combustion profile, peak pressures and exhaust temperatures on the Engine. As the name suggests, CCAI is a calculation based on the density and viscosity of a given fuel. The formula is rather complex but in general, the higher the CCAI, the poorer the ignition quality of the fuel is considered to be. Once the CCAI goes above 860, it is an indication that some combustion problems may occur. Studies carried out by engine manufacturers indicate that combustion related problems caused by fuels with high CCAI can be reduced by avoiding running the engine at part load. It is therefore suggested that wherever possible, the engine load should be maintained above 50% and the chief engineer should listen for indications of poor combustion (i.e. knocking). Should any such problems be noted then it is recommended that an alternative fuel is used whilst further investigations are carried out on samples from this fuel Category:Combustion External links *Online CCAI calculator - residual fuels in marine diesel engines ","title":"Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index"},{"id":"7656263","text":"Kevin James (born 1965) is an American actor and comedian.

They formed in 1999 in Southampton, England, and blended an eclectic mix of rock, progressive, punk and ska influences into their own musical output. They permanently disbanded in April 2008. The band released four full- length albums. The first – The Chameleon Script – was released by Good Clean Fun Records in 2002, with the second and third albums being released on the Household Name Records label in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2008, the band self-released their final album, [ep.i.phan.ic], before splitting up. During their career, Howards Alias also released a split EP with the Californian band Desa, and contributed to several international punk compilation CDs. Origins of name Matthew Reynolds had a dream in which he decided that there should be a name for not only the band, but also the band's sound – this was \\"Howard\\". Using the logic that music should not be confined to one genre, he decided that \\"Howard\\" should have many aliases. Biography Howards Alias began at the end of 1999, writing songs mostly in the ska-punk vein. Even by the time that The Chameleon Script was released in 2002, it became apparent that the band's sound was somewhat more mature and defined than the usual third wave sound that had been overdone in previous years. The album was critically acclaimed; even by notorious UK rock weekly Kerrang!, who awarded it four \\"K\\"s out of five. The band continued to tour hard with bands such as Lightyear, Captain Everything!, No Comply, Sonic Boom Six, Desa and Rx Bandits (who are generally acknowledged as a major influence in later Howards Alias work). In early 2004, the band wrote three new songs for inclusion on a split EP with Desa. The EP showed a change of direction from The Chameleon Script, with the band dropping a lot of the predominant ska influences. This showed a transition that the band cemented with the release of The Answer Is Never later in the same year. The album was hailed by critics as \\"a masterpiece\\" and \\"one of the best British rock records ever made\\", with EuroPunk.net firmly stating \\"If you claim to love music, you owe it to yourself to own this record, simply as that\\". Longtime drummer Jevon Snell left the band in early 2005 (soon to join another Southampton-based band: Chin Music), and was replaced by Jon Warren of Workin Lunch. The band went into the studio with this new line-up to record the follow-up to The Answer Is Never. The result was Beat Heart, Beat, which was released in the July 2005. Less of a drastic step and more of a natural progression from the previous album, the critical reception of the album was mostly positive. The inclusion of a keyboard (played by the multi-talented Nicholas Horne) was particularly praised for adding a new depth to the Howards Alias sound. Some older fans, however, were alienated by the step even further away from the original ska-punk roots of the band. Split With extensive touring taking its toll on inter-band friendships, bassist Stevie and drummer Jon both left the band after a tour to support the release of Beat Heart, Beat. Guitarist and vocalist Matthew Reynolds left a message on the band's website and MySpace informing fans that the band would split up after a final tour. Peter Miles – producer of The Answer Is Never and Beat Heart, Beat – was recruited to play bass, and friend Lloyd Williams took drum duties. Matthew Reynolds spoke in an interview with PunkNews.co.uk, regarding the reasons behind the split: Howards Alias split up in October 2005, with a final hometown show at The Nexus club in Southampton, UK. Thinkpol Matthew Reynolds with brother Andrew Reynolds performing in Thinkpol, Manchester Satan's Hollow, 16 March 2006 In January 2006, Matthew Reynolds revealed plans of a new musical outlet – Thinkpol. Named after the Thought police of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the band had a more straightforward and accessible rock sound than Howards Alias. The band originally consisted of Matthew Reynolds, brother Andrew Reynolds, Peter Miles and Robert King. Peter Miles left the band and was replaced by Nicholas Horne, fresh from his short stint playing bass guitar in NoComply. Thinkpol released two demo CDs with three songs on each, although many more were written for inclusion on their planned debut album. Howards Alias had said that they were working on the unrecorded Thinkpol song \\"Cough It Up\\" for their fourth album [ep.i.phan.ic] but it never materialised. Reformation On 25 September 2006, the following message appeared on Thinkpol's Myspace: This was followed by news of a December tour and fourth album to follow in 2007. This incarnation of the band included Matthew Roberts (formerly of NoComply) on saxophone and Rob King (formerly of Thinkpol) on drums. In the summer of 2007, Howards Alias made three new songs available for streaming on their MySpace over a period of three weeks. The first, entitled \\"Wot 'Ave You\\", appeared on 29 June 2007, with the remaining two tracks—\\"Swansong\\" and \\"Spilt Milk\\"—appearing on the next two consecutive Fridays (the 6 and 13 July respectively). Howards Alias later confirmed via Myspace blog that they would soon be recording their fourth album, tentatively titled [ep.i.phan.ic]. Songs mentioned for inclusion on the album were \\"What A View\\" (a re-titling of \\"Wot 'Ave You\\"), \\"Swansong\\", \\"Spilt Milk\\", \\"Big Brains\\", \\"Long Haul\\", \\"Saw Sense\\", \\"Taking Off\\", \\"We Are The Sun\\", \\"Rooftops\\", \\"Not The Same\\", and \\"Cough It Up\\" (an unrecorded Thinkpol-era song). The band played three dates at the end of October to precede the recording of the album, in Derby, Southampton and Folkestone. In a December blog, [ep.i.phan.ic] was announced as being \\"ready to buy in March 2008\\". The End On 15 April 2008, Reynolds announced that Howards Alias were to permanently disband. This was the first official announcement from Howards Alias in 2008, although Reynolds had been promoting his solo album, The Wreck of the Hesperus, throughout February. Drummer Robert King had left the band in January to continue his career and, following the initial shock, the band had decided to try to recruit a new drummer. In March, however, Matthew Roberts went on tour playing saxophone for Foals and subsequently started tour managing other bands; feeling that he could no longer commit the time to Howards Alias, he also left the band. With almost half of the core members of the band gone, Matthew Reynolds, Nicholas Horne, and David Ransom agreed that it would be \\"a next-to-impossible task to replace them\\". Although disbanding, Howards Alias confirmed their intention to release [ep.i.phan.ic] in a limited run for any fans who expressed an interest in pre- ordering a copy via their Myspace. A total of one thousand copies were pressed. Skylar Skylar is the reggae/traditional ska side project of four members of the underground UK band Howards Alias. Their original drummer, Jon Warren, was also formerly a member of Howards Alias. The band was formed in March 2004 as an outlet for \\"Matt to use material he was writing that wasn't suitable for the other band he plays in\\". To this end, all Skylar songs and lyrics are written by Matthew Reynolds. The band have released an eponymous debut album, recorded in only eleven hours by Peter Miles. It was self- released in a plastic sleeve with a basic photocopied cover, available from Howards Alias gigs and Skylar's official website, before being remixed and re- released with new cover art and an additional two songs by Do The Dog Music in April 2006. On 4 December 2006, Skylar supported the seminal modern reggae outfit Easy Star All-Stars at The Brook in Southampton, UK. Skylar have also been making progress on their second album. Drawings Drawings is an indie/alternative/post-punk outfit, including two former members of Howards Alias (Matthew Reynolds and David Ransom), with the additional appointment of Aaron Graham on the drum set. Drawings became active in late 2008, playing shows in and around the Southampton area. The band also spent time in Ashburton, Devon, demoing songs with good friend producer/engineer Peter Miles at Holne Bridge studios, for potential inclusion on future Drawings releases. Since the band's inception in 2008, the trio have released several singles via the group's Myspace page for streaming, prior to being available for free download. 2008 resulted in the songs \\"Sick to My Heart\\" and \\"Friends\\", while the band released both \\"Sore Thumb\\" and \\"Wallpaper\\" in 2009. 15 August 2009 saw the band release their debut EP, The Seven Deadly Sins, and play their first headlining show in support of the release at Hamptons in the trio's headquarters of Southampton. The EP was recorded and produced by the band themselves; however, it was mixed and mastered by Peter Miles. The Seven Deadly Sins's release was described as a \\"concept\\" recording with each track named after one of the seven deadly sins, (sloth, gluttony, wrath, greed, lust, envy and pride), as Matthew Reynolds believed that he could write a song about each of the seven deadly sins in the context of his life and his view on the good and bad elements of each alleged sin.

Set in a small college town in California, the novel follows the creation of a sustained imaginative game by a group of six children. Plot summary April Hall, the daughter of an up-and-coming film actress, is sent to live with her grandmother in an old apartment house in Berkeley, California. She feels abandoned and masks her grief with truculent sarcasm and Hollywood mannerisms. Her grandmother arranges for her to meet neighbor children Melanie and Marshall Ross, and they bond over \\"imagining games\\" and a shared interest in archaeology. April also investigates a nearby antique shop run by a mysterious and somewhat spooky old man known as The Professor. In the shop's storage yard, the girls discover a replica of the famous bust of Nefertiti, leading them to create a sustained imaginary game about Ancient Egypt. They research actual Ancient Egyptian belief systems and practices, and create their own rituals intended to reproduce them more or less authentically. They are joined by Elizabeth Chung, a nine-year-old Chinese American girl whom they see as resembling a young Nefertiti. At Halloween the children desert their trick or treat group to return to Egypt surreptitiously and are discovered by their aggressive, outgoing classmates Toby Alvillar and Ken Kamata. Melanie and April fear they will ruin everything, but Elizabeth invites them into the game if they will keep it secret. Ken is unenthusiastic and nonchalant initially, but Toby is fascinated, and quickly brings in useful material and ideas. A little girl from the neighborhood disappears and is found murdered, the second such crime in a year. All the children from the area are kept indoors for several weeks. When allowed to play outdoors again, the \\"Egyptians\\" devise an oracle connected to Thoth, and are unnerved by some of its answers. A series of unexplained events lead them to wonder if they should stop playing completely. April returns to Egypt at night to retrieve a lost schoolbook, and is attacked by the murderer. The Professor witnesses the attack, breaks the back window of his store and shouts for help. Professor tells the children that he has been watching the game the whole time, intrigued by how they interpreted and recreated Egyptian myths and history. A widower, he became reclusive after his wife's death. The children feel that the game cannot continue because its essential secrecy has been destroyed. The book ends with April raising the possibility of a new game involving Gypsies.  Legacies  Snyder followed up on the possibility open at the end of the book by writing The Gypsy Game (1997). The gaming scholar Cathlena Martin demonstrated how the book preceded (and maybe influenced) the role-playing gameplay designs of Dungeons & Dragons (1974).Martin, Cathlena. 2018. “Role Playing in Children’s Literature.

Hence the name Bath (rice) and Gama (village) in the Sinhala language. Pre History There were Several different indigenous clans lived in the island during the Pre Vijaya era (before 505 BCE). These clans believed that four main clans are Yaksha, Naga, Dewa (people) , and Raksha. It is believed that these names were attributed metaphorically to indicate their profession. Yaksha tribe of people were believed to inhabit in the mountains where they had used monsoon wind to mould iron, Raksha people were supposed to be farmers who used the steel products of the yaksha tribe of people in their farming endeavors. The name Raksha is derived from the two syllables Ra + Kus, in Sinhalese Kus means \\"stomach\\"; Rakus literally means the people who fulfill hunger or the people who provide rice, the staple food of the Sinhalese people. The Naga tribe of people were believed to be traders, the Deva tribe of people were the ruling, governance, military service, irrigation, trade, engineering, and agriculture. As with most other occupational castes in Sri Lanka, the traditional occupation of Govigama and Bathgama was agriculture under Sri Lanka’s feudal land tenure system. But Govigama and Bathgama both communities was in the same tribe call Raksha in pre Wijayan history. Modern caste system with Kalinga Magha Kulankayan Cinkai Ariyan (1215–1236) or popularly named as ‘Kalinga Maga’ is a South Indian invader who ruled the island for 21 years. The invasion historically important migration of Vellalar Nattar chiefs from the Coromandel Coast of South India who made a new social reorganization in Sinhalese society. They reorganizing villages on the basis of the Hindu caste principles other than Buddhist social system which introduced by Arahath Mahinda Thero in 3rd century BC. This reorganization was also connected with the development with the system of monarchy with absolute power. Thus the development of the monarchy and the development of caste principle during this time transformed Sri Lanka into social organization which was based on caste. Thus the well organized Sinhalese Buddhist community was transformed into caste based new hierarchy when the Kandyan Era. While Vellalar caste became the top of Tamil caste system the shadow of Vellalar, the Sinhalese Govigama caste became the top of Sinhalese society. Kandyan Era Konappu Bandara Appuhamy or *Vimaladharmasuriya I from Yatinuwara at Ededuwa village in Peradeniya who was established the Kandyan Kingdom. His father Weerasundra Bandara of non royal, flourishing Govigama caste member and his mother Kosgolle Gedara Wimalu from Bathgama Caste was served to the Rajasinhe 1 of Sithawaka as Dukgannarala or royal meal certifier. 1582 an army from Rajasinghe 1 attacked Kandy and King Karalliyadde (1552-1582 A.D.) fled to Manner with his family, seeking the protection of the Portuguese and appointed Weerasundara Badara to the post of ajudicator (Saamamtha). But after a few days the king grew suspicious of Weerasundara Bandara, got him killed through subterfuge. Princess Kusumasana Devi daughter of King Karaliyadde, the heir to the Kandyan Kingdom as well as Yamasingha Bandara, a nephew of the King and Konappu Bandara, son of Weerasundara Bandara had fled to the Portuguese and lived under their protection. At this point a Portuguese army was sent to Kandy under Konappu Bandara. Portuguese captured Kandy very easily and made Yamasingha Bandara as the King of Kandy. He died after a few months and Konnapu Bandara was appointed himself as the King. Then he gave leadership and betrayed Portuguese and rebelled against them and made Kandyan Kingdom. British Period Bathgama community has escaped the British period consolidation of cultivator communities as the Govigama caste and exists as an independent but rather disenfranchised caste. Some writers have attempted to call it the “Palanquin bearer” caste. The late British period saw the proliferation of native headmen and a Mudaliyars class drawn from natives who were most likely to serve the British masters with utmost loyalty. (Mudaliyar is a South Indian and Tamil name for ‘first’ and a person endowed with wealth.) This class resembled English country squires, complete with large land grants by the British, residences of unprecedented scale (Referred to by the Tamil word Walauu or Walawoo) and British granted native titles. The British Governor Arthur Hamilton Gordon (1883 – 1890) and his predecessors effectively used divide and rule policies and created caste animosity among the native elite and finally confined all Native Headmen appointments only to the Govigama caste. The British Government was advocating this as an effective policy for easy governance. Mahamudliar Louis De Saram’s family of Dutch and Malay ancestry had Sinhalised and Givigamised itself during the Dutch period and had a strong network of relatives as Mudaliyars by the late 19th century. This “Govigama” Anglican Christian network expanded further with the preponderance of native headmen as Mudaliyars, Korales and Vidanes from the Buddhist Govigama section of the community. The creation of the above Mudaliyar class by the British in the 19th century, its restriction only to the Govigama caste, production of spurious caste hierarchy lists by this class and changes to the land tenure system, resulted in this caste too being classified as a low caste during this period. Although contrary to history, some modern Govigama historians even go to the extent to now suggest that this caste was traditionally bound to serve the Govi caste. The influential Mudaliyar class attempted to keep this caste and all other Sri Lankan castes out of colonial appointments. They also used all possible means to economically and socially marginalise and subjugate all other communities. The oppression by the Mudaliars and connected headmen extended to demanding subservience, service, appropriation of cultivation rights and even restrictions on the type of personal names that could be used by this community. Post Independence period Despite the above setbacks, several members of this caste are now successful entrepreneurs and are recognised as members of the local elite. They are gaining an increased say in modern Sri Lankan politics mainly through the alternative political party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna as the leadership selection processes within the two main political parties are not democratic.Some scholars from Batagama community date back their presence in Sri Lanka to the time period of pre histiic King Ravanna period.Historically they have made fine soldiers and trusted body guards. Some common surnames such as \\" muthudarage\\" \\"illandarage\\"'Hewapedige\\"'Rankothpedige\\"\\"Wagasenevige\\" shows their relevance to military services and some of these surnames dates back to aking adutugemunu era. Even at present Bathgama people together With *Dewa (people) make up the most of the bodyguards for political leaders. Due to marginalisation from mainstream Sinhala Buddhist society there are significant numbers of Christian converts since the colonial period, as conversion provided much easier access to good education and government jobs. Nonetheless, the vast majority of Bathgama people are Buddhists and a large number of prominent Buddhist monks of the \\"Ramagna\\" and \\"Amarapura\\" sects are from Bathgama Caste.

Plot Boyd, a young faith healer, is giving a service in a church and \\"heals\\" a woman, allowing her to walk. However, when Boyd is leading the congregation in song, he has spasms and collapses. When House shows up at work, Wilson approaches him and voices his displeasure of not being invited to House's weekly poker game. Meanwhile, Cameron and Foreman are administering tests when Boyd claims to talk to God about Cameron's feud with Foreman. Cameron and Foreman are shocked, but House is skeptical of every claim of divinity. The tests show low sodium and diluted urine. However, when House goes to talk to Boyd, he notices that he has been drinking water from a previously opened bottle, refilled several times an hour. House meets with Wilson and discusses his patient while Wilson is meeting with a cancer patient named Grace Palmieri. However, Boyd suddenly wakes up and starts wandering the halls, singing Go Tell It on the Mountain. Boyd sees Palmieri, senses that she is sick, and lays his hands on her, performing a \\"healing.\\" Palmieri is shocked, but Chase catches up with Boyd and takes him back to his room. House and his team are discussing Boyd's symptoms when Wilson barges in and tells the group that Palmieri feels better than before, and House suspects that Boyd is talking to Palmieri. House notices an abnormal growth called Tuberous Sclerosis, and claims that it is what is causing all of Boyd's symptoms. Boyd consents to the tubular sclerosis tests after talking to Wilson. Boyd, who seems to have a strange omniscient mind, convinces House to invite Wilson to his poker game. Wilson visits House at home and informs him that Palmieri's tumor has actually shrunk. House orders Chase to search Palmieri's house while House, Wilson, and some unnamed people are playing poker. Chase finds clothes that would suggest that Palmieri has a boyfriend, and gets very concerned after he hears noises outside the door. Via phone, House assures Chase that the boyfriend will not come home, while glaring at Wilson across the poker table. House reasoned that Boyd must have learned of the poker game from Palmieri, and Palmieri from Wilson. House then accuses Wilson of having slept with Palmieri and moved in with her. Wilson, after demanding House tell the rest of the poker party that his name is not Wilson, storms out. They have a short, angry conversation outside. Back at the hospital, Boyd begins to run a fever. House concludes that the Tuberous Sclerosis cannot be causing this, and that a lumbar puncture is needed. However, Boyd refuses any more of \\"man's medicine\\", preferring to leave his life \\"in God's hands.\\" House believes that Boyd has a herpes virus that was acquired through sex, and transmitted to Palmieri when he touched her. Boyd refuses to strip to reveal a rash on his lower back until his father, putting faith in medicine where \\"teenage boys\\" are concerned, tells him to do so. The rash is discovered, confirming the scenario that the herpes virus attacked Palmieri's tumor, making it go into temporary remission.

Service The 34th Wisconsin was organized at Madison, Wisconsin and mustered into Federal service December, 1862. The regiment was mustered out on September 8, 1863, in the course of disciplinary action against various members of the regiment, including the regiment commander, Fritz Anneke. Anneke, a famous Forty-Eighter of German origin, had been a former Prussian officer and artillery commander during the 1849 revolutionary war in Palatinate and Baden, Germany. Carl Schurz, who was later U.S. general, secretary of the Interior and U.S. senator, had been his adjunct officer during that campaign, and his wife Mathilde Franziska Anneke, the famous abolitionist and feminist activist, served as ordnance officer in that campaign. Emil Anneke, the first Michigan Auditor General of the Republican Party, was his brother. Although Anneke was arrested and later dismissed from military service, he was probably innocent and a victim of blackmail. Most of his friends from the German 1849 campaign served as generals in the Union, for example Carl Schurz, August Willich, Ludwig Blenker, and Franz Sigel. Fritz Anneke later tried to be re-admitted to military service, also supported by his brother Emil, but did not succeed.http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/anneke/index.asp Casualties The 34th Wisconsin suffered 1 officers and 18 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 19 fatalities.

It allows more convenient and comfortable viewing when the telescope is pointed at, or near the zenith (i.e. directly overhead). Also, the resulting image is right side up, but is reversed from left to right. Two examples of star diagonals Types of diagonals Star diagonals are available in 0.965\\", 1.25\\" and 2\\" diameters. The 2\\" diagonals allow larger longer focal length low power 2 inch barrel eyepieces for a greater field of view. Star diagonals come in all price ranges, from as low as a few dollars up to hundreds of dollars. =Mirror (reflective) diagonals= These diagonals (often called Star diagonals) use a mirror set at a 45° angle inside the diagonal to turn the telescope's image at a 90° angle to the rear cell. Mirror diagonals produce an image in the eyepiece that is correctly oriented vertically, but is reversed left-to-right horizontally. This causes image reversal, the view in the eyepiece is flipped left-right. The major advantage to mirror diagonals is that they cost less to produce to a high degree of optical accuracy compared to a prism and that they do not introduce any color errors to the image. The major disadvantage of mirror diagonals is that unless the reflective coating is properly applied they can scatter light rendering lower image contrast compared to a 90-degree prism. Also they deteriorate with age as the reflective surface oxidizes. The newer Dielectric mirrors have largely solved the deterioration problem, and if properly made the Dielectric mirrors scatter less light compared to conventional mirrors. With short focal length instruments a mirror diagonal is preferred over a prism. =Prism diagonals= A prism diagonal uses either a simple 90-degree angle prism, pentaprism or an Amici roof prism rather than a mirror to bend the light path. On longer focal ratio telescopes a well-made 90-degree prism diagonal is the optimum choice to deliver the highest image contrast short of using the telescope without a diagonal entirely. However prisms seem to be falling out of favor probably due to marketing forces which have been favoring short focal length instruments which tend to function better with a mirror diagonal.Gary Hand, Diagonals; Prisms vs. Mirrors, cloudynights.com In some special cases however, the color dispersion effects of a prism diagonal can be used to advantage to improve the performance of undercorrected refractor objectives (regardless of focal length) by shifting the spherical and color correction of the objective closer to the design optimum. The natural color dispersion properties (overcorrection) of the prism works to lessen or nullify the undercorrection of the objective lens.Clive Gibbons, Improving Refractor Performance with a Prism Diagonal, cloudynights.com On the other hand, a well- made conventional 90-degree prism star diagonal can transmit as much or more light as a mirror, and do so with higher image contrast since there is no possibility of light scattering from a reflective metallic surface as in a mirror diagonal. Also a prism will never degrade over time as a mirror will since there is no reflective metal coating to degrade from oxidation. However prism diagonals may introduce chromatic aberration when used with short focal- length scopes although this is not a problem with the popular Schmidt- Cassegrain and Maksutov Cassegrain telescopes, which have long focal lengths. Pentaprism A pentaprism provides the same inverted image orientation as viewing without a diagonal would. A simple 90-degree angle prism provides the same \\"flipped\\" or mirror reversed image as a mirror diagonal. Pentaprism diagonals are extremely difficult to find. Amici prism An Amici prism is a type of roof prism which splits the image in two parts and thus allows an upright image without left-right mirroring. This means that what is seen in the eyepiece is the same as what is seen when looking at the sky, or a star chart or lunar map. The disadvantage of typical \\"correct image\\" Amici roof prism diagonals is that because the light path bounces around through a piece of glass, the total amount of light transmitted is less and the multiple reflections required can introduce optical aberrations. At higher magnifications (> 100x) brighter objects have a bright line through the object viewed. Therefore, most Amici roof prisms are more appropriate for low power viewing or for use in spotting scopes for terrestrial rather than astronomical use. But with low-power usage with a rich field, the field can easily be compared with star charts as it is no mirror image. They are available in two types: with 90º angle, just like an ordinary star diagonal and with a 45º angle. Such prisms are often used in spotting scopes for terrestrial viewing, mostly with 45º angle. Such telescopes rarely use magnifications over 60x. Experiences with erect image Amici prisms, cloudynights.com Alignment Even an expensive star diagonal will deliver poor performance if it is not in alignment with the optical axis of the telescope. A telescope in perfect collimation will be thrown out of collimation by a misaligned star diagonal and often this misalignment will determine the image quality of the telescope to a larger extent than the surface accuracy of the prism or mirror. Since the mirror or prism of the star diagonal is located nearly at the focal plane of the instrument, surface accuracy of greater that 1/4 wave is more in the line of advertising than any increase in optical performance. A 1/10 wave mirror or prism star diagonal that throws off the collimation of the telescope will perform worse than a 1/2 wave star diagonal that is in proper alignment.

He lived his entire life in that city. Due to majority-European ancestry, Lanusse could have passed as white, but he embraced his black ancestry. He devoted his life to the republican ideals of liberty and equality for blacks living in the United States. In 1845, Lanusse edited and contributed to Les Cenelles, a collection of 85 poems written in French by 18 Afro-Creole poets of Louisiana. In 1848, Lanusse organized a group of 10 other prominent members of the Afro-Creole community to found \\"The Catholic Institute for the Instruction of Indigent Orphans\\", or \\"L'Institute Catholique.\\" This group successfully sued to obtain control of the estate of Madame Couvent, a wealthy free black woman who died in 1837. She had bequeathed her estate of properties to establish a school for orphans in Louisiana. When a permanent building was constructed for this school in 1852, Lanusse became its principal. He served in that capacity until his death in 1868. While principal, Lanusse established a classical curriculum. It included grammar, logic, rhetoric, mathematics, French, English, science, and personal hygiene. At its peak, the school had 200 students, primarily Afro-Creole orphans and the children of less affluent Afro-Creole parents. In 1861, Lanusse became an officer in the 1st Louisiana Native Guard (CSA), a position which he held until that unit disbanded in April 1862. Shortly after the fall of New Orleans to Union forces in May 1862, Lanusse refused to follow Union General Benjamin Butler's order to fly the American flag over the Institute Catholique. He later regretted this refusal, and became an ardent supporter of the abolitionist cause.

He played all or part of six seasons in Major League Baseball with the New York Yankees (1980), San Diego Padres (1981–83) and Philadelphia Phillies (1983–84 and 1986), primarily as an outfielder. He currently serves as senior advisor for scouting for the San Francisco Giants.  Early life  Lefebvre attended Concord High School and Eckerd College, playing with future Giants general manager Brian Sabean at both schools.Baggarly, Andrew. \\"Giants fire hitting coach Lefebvre\\", Contra Costa Times, October 10, 2007. Accessed November 18, 2007. \\"Lefebvre, 51, had spent six seasons on the Giants staff, including the past five as hitting coach. The former big-league outfielder grew up in New Hampshire and played with Sabean at Concord High School, then at Eckerd College in Florida.\\" In 1976 and 1977, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League.  Playing career  = Yankees =  Minor leagues  Lefebvre was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 3rd round of the 1977 draft on the advice of scout Andy Michael. He began his professional career with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, and by the end of 1977 he had already been promoted to the Double-A West Haven Yankees. He continued to play for West Haven in 1978, batting .266 with 19 home runs while splitting time between the outfield and third base. Lefebvre returned to West Haven in 1979, where he had a breakout season. He led the Eastern League champion Yankees in all three triple crown categories, batting .292 with 21 home runs and 107 RBI.1979 West Haven Yankees In 1980, he was promoted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, and was called up to the majors in mid-May.  1980: Major league debut  The Yankees had lost regular center fielder Ruppert Jones to injury, and Lefebvre was summoned from the minor leagues to replace him. Right fielder Bobby Brown was moved to center, and Lefebvre was installed in right. In his first major league game, he hit a home run off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Dave Stieb. Lefebvre continued to start on and off for the next few weeks, playing both right and left field, sharing time in the outfield with Reggie Jackson and Bobby Murcer. Although he hit well, batting .261 with 8 home runs in 38 games, he was returned to the minor leagues when Jones was activated. He returned in mid-August, but was used mostly as a defensive replacement down the stretch for the American League East champions. His only appearance in the ALCS was in the 9th inning of game 3, when he went out to left field to replace Lou Piniella, who had been pinch-hit for by Jim Spencer.1980 ALCS Game 3 = Padres = Lefebvre looked to have a good chance at breaking camp with the Yankees in 1981, but with just a few days left in spring training he was traded to the San Diego Padres along with Ruppert Jones and two pitchers for John Pacella and Jerry Mumphrey, who was tabbed as the Yankees' new starting center fielder. Instead of playing in New York, Lefebvre wound up being the Padres' starting right fielder. Although he often sat against left-handed pitchers in favor of Dave Edwards, Lefebvre played in 86 games, batting .256 with 8 home runs and 31 RBI. Prior to the 1982 season, the Padres traded shortstop Ozzie Smith and pitcher Steve Mura to the St. Louis Cardinals for shortstop Garry Templeton and outfielder Sixto Lezcano. The acquisition of Lezcano, who would be the Padres' regular right fielder, meant Lefebvre would be relegated to backup duty. He did not take well to the role, as he batted just .157 in 47 games through mid-July, and he was briefly sent back to the minor leagues. He batted .344 in eight games, and was quickly back in the majors. He spent most of September as the Padres' starting third baseman, but he still wound up having what turned out to be his worst year, batting just .238 with 4 home runs in 102 games. 1983 started much the same for Lefebvre, backing up the outfield of Jones, Lezcano, and Gene Richards. During the first few weeks of the season, he was used mostly as either a pinch hitter and defensive replacement, starting just two of the team's first 38 games.Joe Lefebvre 1983 game log On May 22, the Padres traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for left-handed reliever Sid Monge. = Phillies = The Phillies used Lefebvre as something of a super-sub after his acquisition, as he started a number of games in both corner outfield positions and at third base, backing up Gary Matthews, Von Hayes, and Mike Schmidt. In August, he supplanted Hayes as the starting right fielder, and he finished with his best season statistically, batting .306 with a career-high 39 RBI along with 8 home runs, as the Phillies won the National League East. Against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship Series, however, he found himself on the bench behind Lezcano, who had been acquired from the Padres on August 31. The Phillies faced left-handed starters, Jerry Reuss and Fernando Valenzuela, in three of the four games, and Lefebvre wound up batting just three times in the series, driving in one run with a sacrifice fly. A similar situation developed in the World Series, as the Baltimore Orioles sent southpaws Scott McGregor and Mike Flanagan to the mound in three of the five games. Lefebvre started twice, delivering an RBI double in Game 4, as the Phillies lost in five games. Lefebvre began the 1984 season as part of a right field platoon with Lezcano, getting the lion's share of the playing time as a left-handed hitter. He was batting .250 on June 17 when he tore up his knee in a game against the Chicago Cubs. After playing briefly for the Reading Phillies later in the year, he missed the entire 1985 season, then played just 14 games for the Phillies in 1986. He retired on May 28, 1986. = Career overview = In 6 seasons he played in 447 games and had 1,091 at bats, 139 runs, 281 hits, 52 doubles, 13 triples, 31 home runs, 130 RBI, 11 stolen bases, 139 walks, .258 batting average, .344 on-base percentage, .414 slugging percentage, 452 total bases, 8 sacrifice hits, 7 sacrifice flies and 22 intentional walks. Lefebvre with the San Francisco Giants in 2005  Post- playing career  In 1987, Lefebvre was given a coaching job in the Phillies' organization. He remained with the Phillies for three seasons, then in 1990 he was brought to the Yankees by old friend Sabean, who was working as the team's scouting director. He stayed with the Yankees organization from 1990 to 1995, where he served as both coach and roving hitting instructor. By 1993, Sabean had moved on to the Giants, and in 1996 Lefebvre joined him in their organization, where he was hired as hitting coach for the Phoenix Firebirds. From 1997 to 2001, he served as the team's minor league hitting coordinator, and in 2002 he joined the Giants' major league staff as their first base coach under manager Dusty Baker. In 2003, he was named the hitting coach under Felipe Alou. In November 2007, he moved into the Giants front office as a senior advisor for player personnel.Giants name Ron Schueler, Joe Lefebvre and Ed Creech Senior Advisors He was named to his current position of senior scouting advisor in 2011. On August 20, 2011, it was announced that Lefebvre would additionally serve as assistant to current Giants hitting coach Hensley Meulens. In 2015, Lefebvre stepped down as hitting coach and returned to his previous role of senior advisor for scouting.

He batted .317 with 48 RBI (in 53 games) and threw out 18 of 21 runners attempting to steal. Hayes was the Cubs' first-round draft selection and the 13th overall pick in 1978. In two years in the majors, he played in five games and had nine at-bats, two hits, one double, .222 batting average, .222 on-base percentage, .333 slugging percentage, and 3 total bases. Coaching career Hayes coached and managed in the minor leagues in 1988–97 and 1999–2002, with a one-year stint as bullpen coach for the Colorado Rockies in 1998. In the minors, he managed the Geneva Cubs (1988–90), winning a Division Championship in 1990, Peoria Chiefs (1991), Winston-Salem Spirits (1992), and Daytona Cubs (1993) in the Cubs organization. He then moved to the Rockies organization, managing the Central Valley Rockies (1994), Salem Avalanche (1995), New Haven Ravens (1996–97), and Colorado Springs Sky Sox (1999). In the Giants organization, he managed the Shreveport Captains (2000), Hagerstown Suns (2001), and San Jose Giants (2002). Hayes served as the bullpen catcher for the San Francisco Giants from 2003 to 2014, winning three World Series Championships (2010, 2012, 2014). In December 2014, he was promoted to first base coach for the 2015 season. He was removed as first base coach by the Giants after the 2016 season, but remained on the staff in a non- coaching role. After serving as the Giants' minor league catching coordinator in 2018, Hayes returned as manager of the San Jose Giants in 2019, but resigned mid-season. Personal Hayes has two adult daughters, Kirstyn and Megan, as well as a daughter, Savannah, born in 2016.

This eliminated the last signal-controlled crossing on the N7/M7 route between the M50 and Limerick. By 2007, the signal-controlled junction was suffering serious traffic congestion and the upgrade to a grade-separated interchange was planned. The upgraded N7 would pass over the R113.

She was a principal dancer with the Martha Graham Company. With Graham's permission, she started her own dance studio where she taught Graham methods and style. Due to her husband's affliction with Huntington's Disease, she became an activist, founding a predecessor of the Huntington's Disease Society of America.

She had three brothers- David, Herbert and Ben and a sister Gertrude. In 1935, after graduation from the Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Marjorie moved to New York City on scholarship and joined the Martha Graham Dance Company. As a core company member, Marjorie appeared in such iconic pieces as \\"Primitive Mysteries\\", \\"American Document\\", \\"Every Soul is a Circus\\", and \\"Appalachian Spring\\". She grew to become Graham's assistant for fifteen years and was the first company member invited to teach the Graham technique, outside of Martha. Two of Marjorie's early students were Erick Hawkins and Merce Cunningham. = Woody Guthrie = Mazia was introduced to Guthrie in 1940 through her activity as a Martha Graham dancer. According to the Marjorie Guthrie Project: Mazia and Guthrie wed on November 13, 1945. Together they had four children; Cathy Guthrie (b. 1943/d. 1947), Arlo Guthrie (b. 1947), Joady Guthrie (b. 1948), and Nora Guthrie (1950). Cathy tragically died at age four in a fire. = Majorie Mazia School of Dance = Mazia founded the Marjorie Mazia School of Dance, located at 1618 Sheepshead Bay Road, Brooklyn, New York. Thanks to her years with the Martha Graham Dance Company, Marjorie often had special guest dance teachers like Merce Cunningham. which trained young dancers in Modern Dance and Ballet in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.

Written as a comment on population growth, \\"Locomotive Breath\\" was meant to replicate the chugging rhythm of a train. In addition to its release on Aqualung, \\"Locomotive Breath\\" saw two different single releases and has been a live favorite. It is one of Jethro Tull's best- known songs. Background Lyrically, \\"Locomotive Breath\\" was inspired by Anderson's concern regarding overpopulation. He explained, \\"It was my first song that was perhaps on a topic that would be a little more appropriate to today's world. It was about the runaway train of population growth and capitalism, it was based on those sorts of unstoppable ideas. We’re on this crazy train, we can’t get off it. Where is it going? Bearing in mind, of course, when I was born in 1947, the population of planet earth was slightly less than a third of what it is today, so it should be a sobering thought that in one man’s lifetime, our planetary population has more than tripled. You'd think population growth would have brought prosperity, happiness, food and a reasonable spread of wealth, but quite the opposite has happened. And is happening even more to this day. Without putting it into too much literal detail, that was what lay behind that song.\\" The song additionally features a train motif that Anderson has employed on many songs. Anderson later said, \\"Train songs have been with us ever since the blues began, and I have written my fair share of these. I keep being drawn back to the subject, because public transport is part of my life. I don’t drive, so rely on buses, trains and the like.\\" Composition \\"Locomotive Breath\\" was recorded in an unusual manner for the time: the track was pieced together from overdubs, as most of the parts of the song were recorded separately. Ian Anderson did his normal flute and vocal parts in addition to bass drum, hi-hat, acoustic guitar and some electric guitar parts. John Evan's piano parts were then recorded; Clive Bunker added the rest of the drums and Martin Barre finished the electric guitar parts. All of these recordings were then overdubbed onto each other because Anderson was finding it difficult to communicate his musical ideas about the song to the other band members. The song was designed to replicate the chugging of a train in its rhythm. Anderson explained the recording process of the song in an interview, saying Locomotive Breath' was actually an utter failure when we tried to play it all together. It didn't jell. We didn't get the groove. I think John Evan recorded the piano intro, then I went out into the studio with two drum sticks and clicked them together because this was in the days before click tracks, and then I went out and played to with a hi-hat and bass drum. Then Clive [Bunker] went out and added the tom-toms and the cymbals. And then I played the electric-guitar rhythm part all the way through. And then we had something that was beginning to sound a bit like a song and it had that kind of metronomic feel, which I wanted it to have, because it's about a railway train running on the tracks. So it should click- clack in time.\\" The song has been Jethro Tull's live encore during concerts since 1972. During some live concerts, the song would segue into the finale of Pomp and Circumstance, usually to end the concert, or an encore. Release \\"Locomotive Breath\\" was released on Jethro Tull's 1971 album Aqualung in 1971. An edit of the song was released in the US as a single in 1971, backed with \\"Wind-Up\\", though it did not chart. A 1976 single release of the song, backed with \\"Fat Man\\", was more successful, reaching number 59 on the Billboard charts. The song was also released as the B-side to \\"Hymn 43\\". Since its initial releases, the song has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums, including Living in the Past, M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull, and Bursting Out. The song receives frequent airplay on classic rock radio stations. Ian Anderson ranked \\"Locomotive Breath\\" as one of his top 10 Jethro Tull songs. Billboard regarded the song to be Jethro Tull's best purely rock song in some time, saying that it had a similar theme and feel to \\"Aqualung.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock named the song Jethro Tull's third best, saying, \\"This tune covers the length and breadth of Anderson’s songwriting talents, beginning with a bluesy John Evan piano intro so discreet one can barely hear it at times, before crashing into some of the most bombastic hard rock display of the band’s career.\\" The song was ranked the fourth best Jethro Tull song by .

D. Palmer The history of chiropractic began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmer's office, Lillard bent over to empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, \\"I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing.\\" Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie face down on the floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, \\"I can hear that rackets on the streets.\\" This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word \\"chiropractic\\" from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a \\"machine\\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improved health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system. Despite the similarities between chiropractic and osteopathy, the latter's practitioners sought to differentiate themselves by seeking licensure to regulate the profession, calling chiropractic a \\"bastardized form of osteopathy\\". In 1907 in a test of the new osteopathy law, a Wisconsin based chiropractor was charged with practicing osteopathic medicine without a license. Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed. Ironically the Palmers legal defence of chiropractic consisted of the first chiropractic textbook 'Modernized Chiropractic' published in 1906, written by \\"mixer\\" chiropractors Longworthy, Smith, et al., whom the Palmers despised. Although the chiropractors won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases they were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974. Division within the profession has been intense, with \\"mixers\\" combining spinal adjustments with other treatments, and \\"straights\\" relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an \\"unscientific cult\\" and boycotted it until losing a 1987 antitrust case. For most of its existence, chiropractic has battled with mainstream medicine, sustained by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation. By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic.  1890s  In 1895, the world was in the Second Industrial Revolution, marked by innovation and creativity. Health care had emerged from the practice of heroic medicine. All varieties of treatments and cures including scientific medicine, vitalism, herbalism, magnetism and leeches, lances, tinctures and patent medicines were competing to be the new method for the century. Neither consumers nor many practitioners had much knowledge of either the causes of, or cures for, illnesses.\\"The Chiropractic Profession and Its Research and Education Programs\\", Final Report, pg 41, Florida State University, MGT of America, December 2000 The theory of modern medicine, fueled by Louis Pasteur's refutation of the centuries-old spontaneous generation theory in 1859, was growing as Charles Darwin published his book on natural selection. The German bacteriologist Robert Koch formulated his postulates, bringing scientific clarity to what was a new field. Drugs, medicines and quack cures were becoming more prevalent and were unregulated. Concerned about what he saw as the abusive nature of drugging, MD Andrew Taylor Still ventured into magnetic healing (meaning hypnotism) and bonesetting in 1875. He opened the American School of Osteopathy (ASO) in Kirksville, Missouri in 1892. =First chiropractic adjustment = Harvey Lillard 1906 Daniel David Palmer (D.D. Palmer), a teacher and grocer turned magnetic healer, opened his office of magnetic healing in Davenport, Iowa in 1886. After nine years, D.D. Palmer gave the first chiropractic adjustment to Harvey Lillard, on September 18, 1895. According to D.D. Palmer, adjusting the spine is the cure for all diseases for the human race. Palmer and his patient Harvey Lillard gave differing accounts of when and how Palmer began to experiment with spinal manipulation. Palmer recalled an incident in 1895 when he was investigating the medical history of a partially deaf man, Harvey Lillard. Lillard informed Palmer that while working in a cramped area seventeen years earlier, he felt a 'pop' in his back, and had been nearly deaf ever since. Palmer's examination found a sore lump which he believed was a spinal misalignment and a possible cause of Lillard's poor hearing. Palmer claimed to have corrected the misalignment and that Lillard's hearing improved.Palmer, D.D. (1910) The Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic Portland, Oregon: Portland Printing House Company Palmer said \\"there was nothing accidental about this, as it was accomplished with an object in view, and the expected result was obtained. There was nothing 'crude\\" about this adjustment; it was specific so much so that no chiropractor has equaled it.\\" However, this version was disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard Simons. She said that her father told her that he was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and, Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, laughing heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. Simons said \\"the compact was that if they can make [something of] it, then they both would share. But, it didn't happen.\\" Since D.D. Palmer's first claim of restoring hearing to Harvey Lillard, there has been controversy about whether a link actually could exist between the spinal adjustment and return of hearing. Critics asserted that a spinal adjustment cannot affect certain areas – like the brain – because the spinal nerves do not extend into the encephalon. Years later, V. Strang, D.C. illustrated several neurological explanations including the recognition that sympathetic nerves arising in the lateral horns of the upper thoracic levels of the spine form the upper cervical ganglion with postganglionic fibers ascending to supply, among other things, blood vessels of the brain,Strang, V (1984) Essential Principles of Chiropractic Davenport : Palmer College of Chiropractic, but still with no connection to hearing. Others, though, talked about vertebral subluxation. Early growth Rev. Samuel Weed After the case of Harvey Lillard, Palmer stated: \\"I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. I examined the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief – nothing \\"accidental\\" or \\"crude\\" about this. Then I began to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time.\\" D.D. Palmer asked a patient and friend, Rev. Samuel Weed, to help him name his discovery. He suggested combining the words cheiros and praktikos (meaning \\"done by hand\\") to describe Palmer's treatment method, creating the term \\"chiropractic.\\" D.D. initially hoped to keep his discovery a family secret, but in 1896 he added a school to his magnetic healing infirmary, and began to teach others his method. It would become known as Palmer School of Chiropractic (PSC, now Palmer College of Chiropractic). Among the first graduates were Andrew P. Davis MD, DO, William A. Seally, MD, B.J. Palmer (D.D.'s son), Solon M. Langworthy, John Howard, and Shegataro Morikubo. Langworthy moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa and opened the second chiropractic school in 1903, the American School of Chiropractic & Nature Cure (ASC & NC), combining it with what would become naturopathic cures and osteopathy. D.D. Palmer, who was not interested in mixing chiropractic with other cures, turned down an offer to be a partner. D.D. Palmer established a magnetic healing facility in Davenport, Iowa, styling himself ‘doctor’. Not everyone was convinced, as a local paper in 1894 wrote about him: \\"A crank on magnetism has a crazy notion that he can cure the sick and crippled with his magnetic hands. His victims are the weak-minded, ignorant and superstitious, those foolish people who have been sick for years and have become tired of the regular physician and want health by the short-cut method…he has certainly profited by the ignorance of his victims…His increase in business shows what can be done in Davenport, even by a quack.\\" Archived copy.  Changing political and healthcare environment  The early 19th century had seen the rise of patent medicine and the nostrum remedium trade. Although some remedies were sold through doctors of medicine, most were sold directly to consumers by lay people, some of whom used questionable advertising claims. The addictive, and sometimes toxic, effects of some remedies, especially morphine and mercury- based cures (known as quicksilver or quacksilber in German), prompted the popular rise of less dangerous alternatives, such as homeopathy and eclectic medicine. In the mid-19th century, as the germ theory began to replace the metaphysical causes of disease, the search for invisible microbes required the world to embrace the scientific method as a way to discover the cause of disease. In the U.S., licensing for healthcare professionals had all but vanished around the time of the Civil War, leaving the profession open to anyone who felt inclined to become a physician; the market alone determined who would prove successful and who would not. Medical schools were plentiful, inexpensive and mostly privately owned. With free entry into the profession, and education in medicine cheap and available, many men entered practice, leading to an overabundance of practitioners which drove down the individual physician's income.Goodman J, Musgrave G (1992) \\"How The Cost-Plus System Evolved\\", excerpted from: John C. Goodman and Gerald L. Musgrave Patient Power Washington, DC: Cato Institute W67 National Center for Policy Analysis  NCPA. Archived from the original on February 14, 2006. In 1847, the American Medical Association (AMA) was formed and established higher standards for preliminary medical education and for the MD. At the time, most medical practitioners were unable to meet the stringent standards, so a \\"grandfather clause\\" was included. The effect was to limit the number of new practitioners. In 1849, the AMA established a board to analyze quack remedies and nostrums and to enlighten the public about their nature and their dangers. Relationships were developed with pharmaceutical companies in an effort to curb the patent medicine crisis and consolidate the patient base around the medical doctor. By the turn of the 20th century, the AMA had created a Committee on National Legislation to represent the AMA in Washington and re-organized as the national organization of state and local associations. Intense political pressure by the AMA resulted in unlimited and unrestricted licensing only for medical physicians that were trained in AMA-endorsed colleges. By 1901, state medical boards were created in almost every state, requiring licentiates to provide a diploma from an AMA-approved medical college. By 1910, the AMA was a powerful force; this was the beginning of organized medicine. In 1880, the teaching profession had begun significant changes as well. Advances in chemistry and science in Germany created strong incentives to create markets for their new products. By 1895, the new \\"Kulturopolitik\\" ideology of \\"First teach them; then sell them\\" had begun creating the political pressure necessary to improve teaching in science and math in schools and colleges in the US. The medical schools were the first to suffer the attack; they were ridiculed as obsolete – inadequate – and inefficient. The crisis attracted the attention of some of the world's richest men. In 1901, John D. Rockefeller created the \\"Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research\\".Lerner, Cyrus. Report on the history of chiropractic (unpublished manuscript, L.E. Lee papers, Palmer College Library Archives) By 1906, the AMA's Council on Medical Education had created a list of unacceptable schools. In 1910, the Flexner Report, financed by the Carnegie Foundation, closed hundreds of private medical and homeopathic schools and named Johns Hopkins as the model school. The AMA had created the nonprofit, federally subsidized university hospital setting as the new teaching facility of the medical profession, effectively gaining control of all federal healthcare research and student aid.  Osteopathic medicine vs chiropractic medicine  In 1870 Palmer was '\\"probably\\" a student of metaphysics, became a student of science in 1890 while practicing magnetic healing and after \\"discovering\\" chiropractic in 1895 attempted to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, D.D. Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic was strikingly similar to Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a \\"machine\\" whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction to improve health; chiropractors dubbed this manipulable lesion \\"subluxation\\" which interfered with the nervous system. Palmer drew further distinctions by noting that he was the first to use short-lever manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers to spinal dysfunction/subluxation. Soon after, osteopaths began an American wide campaign proclaimed that chiropractic was a bastardized form of osteopathy and sought licensure to differentiate themselves. Although Palmer initially denied being trained by osteopathic medicine founder A.T. Still, in 1899 in papers held at the Palmer College of Chiropractic he wrote: : \\"Some years ago I took an expensive course in Electropathy, Cranial Diagnosis, Hydrotherapy, Facial Diagnosis. Later I took Osteopathy [which] gave me such a measure of confidence as to almost feel it unnecessary to seek other sciences for the mastery of curable disease. Having been assured that the underlying philosophy of chiropractic is the same as that of osteopathy...Chiropractic is osteopathy gone to seed.\\"  Medicine vs chiropractic  Since its inception, chiropractic was controversial amongst the established medical orthodoxy. Chiropractors were jailed for \\"practicing medicine without a license\\" which the profession designed a legal and political defence against prosecution arguing that chiropractic was \\"separate and distinct from medicine\\", asserting that chiropractors \\"analyzed\\" rather than \\"diagnosed\\", and \\"adjusted\\" subluxations rather than \\"treated\\" disease. In 1963 the American Medical Association formed a \\"Committee on Quackery\\" designed to \\"contain and eliminate\\" the chiropractic profession. In 1966, the AMA referred to chiropractic an \\"unscientific cult\\" and until 1980 and held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate themselves with \\"unscientific practitioners\\". Then in 1987, the AMA was found to have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade \\"to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.\\" In the 1980s, spinal manipulation gained mainstream recognition and has spurred ongoing collaboration into research of manipulative therapies and models of delivery of chiropractic care for musculoskeletal conditions in the mainstream healthcare sector. In September 1899, a medical doctor in Davenport named Heinrich Matthey started a campaign against drugless healers in Iowa, demanding a change in the statute to prevent drugless healers from practicing in the state and claiming that health education could no longer be entrusted to anyone but doctors of medicine. Osteopathic schools across the country responded by developing a program of college inspection and accreditation. D.D. Palmer, whose school had just graduated its 7th student, insisted that his techniques did not need the same courses or license as medicine, as his graduates did not prescribe drugs or evaluate blood or urine. In 1901, D.D. was charged with misrepresenting a course in chiropractic which was not a real science. He persisted in his strong stance against licensure, citing freedom of choice as his cause. He was arrested twice more by 1906, and although he contended that he was not practicing medicine, he was convicted for professing he could cure disease without a license in medicine or osteopathy. Dr Solon Langworthy, who continued to mix chiropractic at the ASC&NC;, took a different route for chiropractic. He improved classrooms and provided a curriculum of study instead of the single course. He narrowed the scope of chiropractic to the treatment of the spine and nervous system, leaving blood work to the osteopath, and began to refer to the brain as the \\"life force\\". He was the first to use the word subluxation to describe the misalignment that narrowed the \\"spinal windows\\" (or intervertebral foramina) and interrupted the nerve energy. In 1906, Langworthy published the first book on chiropractic, Modernized Chiropractic\\" – \\"Special Philosophy – A Distinct System. He brought chiropractic into the scientific arena.  B.J. Palmer re- develops chiropractic  B.J. Palmer, developer of chiropractic D.D. Palmer's student and son, B.J. Palmer, assumed control of the Palmer School in 1906, and promoted professionalism and formal training in chiropractic, expanding enrollment to a peak of above 1,000 students in the early 1920s. Chiropractic leaders of the time often invoked religious imagery, and B.J. seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, deciding against this partly to avoid confusion with Christian Science. B.J. also worked to overcome chiropractic's initial resistance to the use of medical technology, by accepting diagnostic technology such as spinal X-rays (which he called spinography) in 1910. Prosecution of DCs for unlicensed practice after the conviction of D.D. Palmer and a previous charge against B.J. Palmer resulted in B.J. and several Palmer graduates creating the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA). Its initial purpose was to protect its members by covering their legal expenses should they get arrested.Keating J. (1999), Tom Moore Defender of Chiropractic Part 1, Dynamic Chiropractic Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo DC of Wisconsin was charged with unlicensed practice of osteopathy. It was a test of the new osteopathic law. In an ironic twist, using mixer Langworthy's book Modernized Chiropractic, attorney Tom Morris legally differentiated chiropractic from osteopathy by the differences in the philosophy of chiropractic's \\"supremacy of the nerve\\" and osteopathy's \\"supremacy of the artery\\".Barral, J.P., Croibier, A. Manual Therapy for the Peripheral Nerves, Elsevier Health Sciences, 2007, 270 pages, p. 75 Morikubo was freed, and the victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art and a philosophy, and B.J. Palmer became the \\"Philosopher of Chiropractic\\". John F.A. Howard, DC, founder, National College of Chiropractic B.J. Palmer believed that their chiropractic school was founded on \\"…a business, not a professional basis. We manufacture chiropractors. We teach them the idea and then we show them how to sell it\\". The next 15 years saw the opening of 30 more chiropractic schools, including John Howard's National School of Chiropractic (now the National University of Health Sciences) that moved to Chicago, Illinois. Each school attempted to develop its own identity, while B.J. Palmer continued to develop the philosophy behind his father's discovery. Fueled by the persistent and provocative advertising of recent chiropractic graduates, local medical communities, who had the power of the state at their disposal, immediately had them arrested. There were only 12,000 practicing chiropractors with more than 15,000 prosecutions for practicing medicine without a license in the first 30 years.Hug PR, A Century of Organized Chiropractic, ACA website D.D. Palmer was also jailed for practicing medicine without a license. Tom Morris and his partner, Fred Hartwell, were able to successfully defend 80% through the UCA. B.J. would later note about those battles: :\\"We are always mindful of those early days when UCA...used various expedients to defeat medical court prosecutions. We legally squirmed this way and that, here and there. We did not diagnose, treat, or cure disease. We analyzed, adjusted cause, and Innate in patient cured. All were professional matters of fact in science, therefore justifiable in legal use to defeat medical trials and convictions.\\"Keating J. BJ Palmer Chronology His influence over the next several years further divided the mixers, or those who mixed chiropractic with other cures, from the straights who practiced chiropractic by itself.  D.D. Palmer's last years  While B.J. worked to protect and develop chiropractic around the Palmer school, D.D. Palmer continued to develop his techniques from Oregon. In 1910, he theorized that nerves control health. Before his sudden and controversial death in 1913, D.D. Palmer often voiced concern for B.J. Palmer's management of chiropractic. He challenged B.J.'s methods and philosophy and made every effort to regain control of chiropractic. He repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone(health) of the end organ and noted, \\"A subluxated vertebra . . . is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases. . . . The other five percent is caused by displaced joints other than those of the vertebral column.\\"Keating J.(1996).Early Palmer Theories of Dis-ease During the long-fought battle for licensure in California, in 1911 he wrote of his philosophy for chiropractic, and hinted at his plan for the legal defense of chiropractic.Palmer D.D. (1911). D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic In \\"The Chiropractor\\", published posthumously in 1914, D.D. Palmer revisits the topic of chiropractic as religion, quoting F.W. Carlin as saying \\"The Religion of Chiropractic is absurd\\". He continued: \\"I fully agree with Dr. Carlin. To say or think that the science, art and philosophy of Chiropractic, or that Chiropractic, the three combined, has a religion, is really absurd and ridiculous\\".Palmer, D: \\"The Chiropractor\\", Press of Beacon Light Printing Co., 1914, p. 7. The 2008 book Trick or Treatment states that in 1913 B.J. Palmer ran over his father, D.D. Palmer, at a homecoming parade for the Palmer School of Chiropractic. Weeks later D.D. Palmer died. The official cause of death was recorded as typhoid. The book Trick or Treatment indicated \\"it seems more likely that his death was a direct result of injuries caused by his son.\\" There was speculation that it was not an accident, but instead a case of patricide. Chiropractic historian Joseph C. Keating, Jr. has described the attempted patricide of D.D. Palmer as a \\"myth\\" and \\"absurd on its face\\" and cites an eyewitness who recalled that DD was not struck by BJ's car, but rather, had stumbled. He also says that \\"Joy Loban, DC, executor of DD's estate, voluntarily withdrew a civil suit claiming damages against B.J. Palmer, and that several grand juries repeatedly refused to bring criminal charges against the son.\\" They had become bitter rivals over the leadership of chiropractic. B.J. Palmer resented his father for the way he treated his family, stating that his father beat three of his children with straps and was so much involved in chiropractic that he hardly knew his children. D. D. claimed that his son B. J. struck him with his car.  Straights versus Mixers  State laws to regulate and protect chiropractic practice were introduced in all fifty states in the USA. Medical Examining Boards worked to keep all healthcare practices under their legal control, but an internal struggle among DC's on how to structure the laws complicated the process. Initially, the UCA, led by B.J. Palmer, opposed state licensure altogether. Palmer feared that such regulation would lead to MD physician control of the profession.Phillips R (1998), Education and the Chiropractic Profession, Dynamic Chiropractic The UCA eventually caved in, but B.J. remained strong in the opinion that examining boards should be composed exclusively of chiropractors (not mixers), and the educational standards to be adhered to were the same as the Palmer School. A \\"Model Bill\\" was drafted in 1922 to present to all states that did not yet have a law. They warned state associations to purge their mixing members or face competition by the formation of a new \\"straight\\" association in their state. Although D.D. and B.J. were \\"straight\\" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called \\"mixers\\", advocated the use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed X-rays as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students. The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight. That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S. Frank Margetts circa 1922 Mixers, disturbed by the edicts of the PSC having so much influence in their daily practice, created the American Chiropractic Association (one of the early precursors to today's ACA). Though born out of necessity to defend against the UCA attacks, the ACA's stated purposes were to advance education and research for chiropractic. Its growth was initially stunted by its resolution to recognize physio-therapy and other modalities as pertaining to chiropractic. What growth did occur was credited to its second president, Frank R. Margetts, DC with support from his alma mater, National Chiropractic College. He insisted that no college administrator could hold an official position in the association, giving doctors in the field a collective voice. But a disagreement within the UCA in 1924 turned the tide for the ACA. B.J. was still working to purge mixers from practicing chiropractic, and he saw a new invention by Dossa D. Evans, the \\"Neurocalometer\\" (NCM), as the answer to all of straight chiropractic's (and particularly PSC's) legal and financial problems. As the owner of the patent on the NCM, he planned to limit the number of NCMs to 5000 and lease them only to graduates of the Palmer related schools who were members of the UCA. He then claimed that the NCM was the only way to accurately locate subluxations, preventing over 20,000 mixers from being able to defend their method of practice.Chiropractic History Archives Neurocalometer There was an immediate uproar among practicing DCs. Even Tom Moore, B.J.'s long-time ally and president of the UCA, displayed his dismay by resigning (though he was later reinstated). B.J. reluctantly resigned as treasurer, ending his relationship with the UCA. B.J. moved on to form the Chiropractic Health Bureau (today's ICA), along with his staunchest supporters and Fred Hartwell (Tom Moore's partner) acting as council. Membership in the UCA dropped while the ACA membership rose. In 1930, the ACA and UCA joined to form the National Chiropractic Association (NCA). The NCA developed a Committee on Educational Standards (CES), making John J. Nugent DC responsible for raising educational standards for the profession. The years of consolidation or closing of unacceptable schools while developing the new standards earned Nugent the nickname \\"Chiropractic's Abraham Flexner\\" from his admirers and \\"Chiropractic's Anti-christ\\" from his adversaries. The CES evolved into today's Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE), and was granted the status of chiropractic's accrediting body by the US Department of Education. Nugent was also instrumental in the Chiropractic Research Foundation (CRF), today's Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research (FCER). The differences in state laws that exist today can be traced back to these early legal struggles. Chiropractic struggled with survival and identity during its formative years, including internal struggles between its leaders and colleges. Chiropractic is rooted in mystical concepts, leading to internal conflicts between straights and mixers which continue to this day. Objective Straight chiropractors, who are an offshoot of straights, only focus on the correction of chiropractic vertebral subluxations while traditional straights claim that chiropractic adjustments are a plausible treatment for a wide range of diseases. Reform chiropractors are an evidence-based offshoot of mixers who reject traditional Palmer philosophy and tend not to use alternative medicine methods. See: National Association for Chiropractic Medicine From 1984 to about 2008, some of them were organized as the National Association for Chiropractic Medicine, an organization which met strong opposition from the profession and finally ceased to exist. Debate There is continued disagreement over what \\"innate\\" and \\"subluxation\\" mean to chiropractic. Some chiropractors believe in Innate Intelligence, a faith-based, unscientific belief which has been a source of derision for chiropractors. Chiropractors historically were strongly opposed to vaccination based on their belief that all diseases were traceable to causes in the spine, and therefore could not be affected by vaccines; D.D. Palmer wrote, \\"It is the very height of absurdity to strive to 'protect' any person from smallpox or any other malady by inoculating them with a filthy animal poison.\\" There is significant disagreement within the chiropractic community concerning vaccination, one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available. Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors in the U.S. Some chiropractors oppose water fluoridation as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Although most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, antivaccination sentiment is espoused by what appears to be a minority of chiropractors. Recently, other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.  AMA plans to eliminate chiropractic  On November 2, 1963, the AMA Board of Regents created the \\"Committee on Quackery\\" with the goals of first containing, and then eliminating chiropractic. H. Doyle Taylor, the Director of the AMA Department of Investigation and Secretary of the Committee on Quackery, outlined the steps needed:Phillips R (2003), Dynamic Chiropractic Truth and the Politics of knowledge # to ensure that Medicare should not cover chiropractic # to ensure that the U.S. Office of Education should not recognize or list a chiropractic accrediting agency # to encourage continued separation of the two national associations # to encourage state medical societies to take the initiative in their state legislatures in regard to legislation that might affect the practice of chiropractic. The AMA worked to spread information designed to discredit chiropractic through public media and the scientific literature. The longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an \\"unscientific cult\\" in 1966, and until 1980 held that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with \\"unscientific practitioners\\". In 1975, an anonymous AMA insider describing himself as a disgruntled AMA staffer and identifying himself as \\"Sore Throat\\" released information concerning the Committee on Quackery and its proposed methods to eliminate chiropractic to the press.Robbins J (1996), Medical monopoly: the game nobody wins – excerpt from 'Reclaiming Our Health: Exploding the Medical Myth and Embracing the Source of True Healing', Vegetarian Times available online These papers were the basis of Wilk et al. vs. AMA, the suit brought by Chester Wilk, D.C., of Illinois and five co- plaintiffs against the AMA and several co-defendants. After two trials, on September 25, 1987, Getzendanner issued her opinion that the AMA had violated Section 1, but not 2, of the Sherman Act, and that it had engaged in an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade \\"to contain and eliminate the chiropractic profession.\\" (Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n, 671 F. Supp. 1465, N.D. Ill. 1987).  Movement toward scientific reform  Research to test chiropractic theories began in 1935 with the B.J. Palmer Research Clinic at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. The clinic was organized into two divisions – a medical division and a chiropractic division. The medical division contained all the standard medical tests of the time and was used to establish a medical diagnosis of a patient's condition before the patient received treatment. The chiropractic division administered the treatment which included passive therapies, chiropractic adjustments and physical rehabilitation for the various conditions diagnosed. Research continued in the B.J. Palmer research clinic until B.J. Palmer's death in 1961 and the results and findings of these patient cases were the substance of B.J. Palmer's publishing over this 30-year time-period. By the late 1950s, healthcare in the US had been transformed: the discovery of penicillin and development of the polio vaccine was restoring hope to millions, and the homeopathic physician had all but vanished as a result of \\"antiquackery\\" efforts of the medical trust and leadership efforts of the AMA. B.J. reduced the adjustment to HIO (Hole In One – the adjustment of only the atlas), while mixers continued to add and refine new proprietary techniques to find and reduce subluxations and improve health. Osteopathy in the US developed in parallel to medicine and dropped its reliance on spinal manipulation to treat illness. A similar reform movement began within chiropractic: shortly after the death of B.J. in 1961, a second generation chiropractor, Samuel Homola, wrote extensively on the subject of limiting the use of spinal manipulation, proposing that chiropractic as a medical specialty should focus on conservative care of musculoskeletal conditions.Homola S (2006), Can Chiropractors and Evidence-Based Manual Therapists Work Together? An Opinion From a Veteran Chiropractor His sentiments echoed those of the NCA chairman of the board (C.O. Watkins DC) twenty years earlier: \\"If we will not develop a scientific organization to test our own methods, organized medicine will usurp our privilege. When it discovers a method of value, medical science will adopt it and incorporate it into scientific medical practice.\\"Keating J (1990), A Guest Review by Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD. Associate Professor, Palmer College of Chiropractic-West Dynamic Chiropractic Homola's membership in the newly formed ACA was not renewed, and his position was rejected by both straight and mixer associations. Chiropractic is classified as a field of pseudomedicine on account of its esoteric origins. Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine. In 1975, the National Institutes of Health brought chiropractors, osteopaths, medical doctors and PhD scientists together in a conference on spinal manipulation to develop strategies to study the effects of spinal manipulation. In 1978, the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics (JMPT) was launched, and in 1981 it was included in the National Library of Medicine's Index Medicus.Keating J Faulty Logic & Non-skeptical Arguments in Chiropractic Joseph C. Keating, Jr. dates the birth of chiropractic as a science to a 1983 commentary in the JMPT entitled \\"Notes from the (chiropractic college) underground\\" in which Kenneth F. DeBoer, then an instructor in basic science at Palmer College in Iowa, revealed the power of a scholarly journal (JMPT) to empower faculty at the chiropractic schools. DeBoer's opinion piece demonstrated the faculty's authority to challenge the status quo, to publicly address relevant, albeit sensitive, issues related to research, training and skepticism at chiropractic colleges, and to produce \\"cultural change\\" within the chiropractic schools so as to increase research and professional standards. It was a rallying call for chiropractic scientists and scholars. By the mid-1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain. In 2008, Simon Singh was sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) for criticizing their activities in a column in The Guardian. A preliminary hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in front of Justice David Eady. The judge held that merely using the phrase \\"happily promotes bogus treatments\\" meant that he was stating, as a matter of fact, that the British Chiropractic Association was being consciously dishonest in promoting chiropractic for treating the children's ailments in question. An editorial in Nature has suggested that the BCA may be trying to suppress debate and that this use of British libel law is a burden on the right to freedom of expression, which is protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. The libel case ended with the BCA withdrawing its suit in 2010.  References  Further reading * Folk, Holly.

A native to Baltimore, Maryland, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1939, his Master of Arts in 1941, and (after a period of service in the Navy) his Ph.D. in 1947, all at Princeton University.Princeton Weekly Bulletin 92, No. 10 (Nov. 18, 2002). This is the original source of the biographical summary and is entered into Wikipedia based on the following statement in the Bulletin: \\"Permission is given to adapt, reprint or excerpt material from the Bulletin for use in other media.\\" A long-term director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton, Coale was especially influential for his work on the demographic transition and leadership of the European Fertility Project. European Fertility Project: Introduction and Overview  Early childhood and education  Ansley Coale was the youngest of three children born from Nellie and James Coale. One year after he was born, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio where he spent most of his early years receiving an \\"excellent\\" education. The Coale family moved to Annapolis, Maryland in 1928. Ansley Coale attended a public high school starting in 1930. His intentions were to enroll in Princeton University like his older brother Jim did in 1933. By the time Ansley was 16 years old, he was ready to graduate high school. After an extra year at the Mercersburg Academy, a preparatory school, he was accepted into Princeton. This extra year of education was not only important for his intellectual development, but he ended up having 18 companions from the academy that also went to Princeton. After he obtained his Bachelor's of Arts (BA) and master's degree in economics, Ansley Coale was offered a fellowship by the director of the Office of Population Research, Frank Notestein, as long as demography was a field of study. Over the years the two of them became well-known demographers. Six years after he received his master's degree, Ansley Coale obtained his Ph.D. in 1947. Works Coale, the William Church Osborne Professor of Public Affairs Emeritus and professor of economics emeritus at Princeton University, was a prolific author, publishing more than 125 books and articles on a wide variety of demographic topics. His \\"Growth and Structure of Human Populations\\" (1972) is considered an essential textbook for those interested in formal demography. He also trained and served as a mentor to many students who became leaders in the field. Coale joined the faculty at Princeton in 1947, the same year he received his Ph.D. at the same site. He spent his entire academic career at the University's Office of Population Research, serving as director from 1959 to 1975. He was president of the Population Association of America in 1967–68 and president of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) from 1977 to 1981. Coale's first major influential work was Population Growth and Economic Development in Low-Income Countries (1958), whom he co-wrote with Edgar Hoover. The results, which showed that slowing population growth could enhance economic development, had a major impact on public policy and set the research agenda in this field. This study was followed by Regional Model Life Tables and Stable Populations (1966), whom he co-wrote with Paul Demeny. These model life tables both established new empirical regularities, and proved invaluable in the development of later techniques for estimating mortality and fertility in populations with inaccurate or incomplete data. Along with William Brass, Coale pioneered the development and use of these techniques, first explained in Methods of Estimating Basic Demographic Measures From Incomplete Data (1967, with Demeny) and in The Demography of Tropical Africa (1968, with other demographers). Perhaps Coale's major scientific contribution was to the understanding of the demographic transition. The Demographic Transition, as stated by Coale, occurs when a country develops a strong economy, and within the society, low fertility and mortality will start to reflect based upon the economic standpoint. Coale was the pioneer of the European Fertility Project, which examined the decline in marital fertility in Europe. The European Project's goal was to correlate the fertility rates within married couples, and also the rate of infant mortality. Coale established three pre-conditions to fertility decline. The first one is \\"within the conscious of choice\\". In other words, it is up to the individual and within their own decision to have children. The second one would be if a society sees not having children as advantageous, then fertility will decline. The third pre-condition is to have contraception methods ready. It is important to emphasize that a society will start to shows signs of fertility decline if these three pre-conditions are met. Initiated in 1963, the project resulted in the publication of nine major books summarizing the change in childbearing over a century in the 700 provinces in Europe. The Project findings eventually led to the conclusion that even though economical factors can play a role in fertility decline, this is not the absolute determinant of fertility decline. The European Project led to a better understanding that infant mortality and fertility decline do not necessarily follow each other. With a long-time interest in the population of Russia, which first found outlet in Coale's work on the life tables that he constructed for Frank Lorimer's classic The Population of the Soviet Union (1946), Coale also later co-authored a volume on Russia for the European Fertility Project series.Frank Lorimer, The Population of the Soviet Union: History and Prospects (Geneva: League of Nations, 1946). Toward the end of his career, Coale became interested in the population changes in China and understanding the fertility transition there as well as factors affecting the sex ratio at birth. In a study conducted by Ansley J. Coale, India and China were compared in both their population size and fertility trends. A survey named the 1/1000 Fertility Survey, reached out to women living in various provinces of China and asked them to relate a brief history of their marital status and a family planning discussion. The survey then served as an understanding of the population and fertility changes that would occur in China shortly after. Published in a Journal article called Population trends in China and India, Coale introduced the possible causes of differences in fertility trends in such high populated countries. These reasons are based on policies put in place to reduce birth rates and some cultural differences that come into play as well. Finally, Coale presents the future of both countries and states that despite the efforts to reduce birth rates, the countries will remain to be most populated. Honors Coale was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and was a recipient of several honorary degrees from universities including Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Louvain and the University of Liège. He was also a corresponding fellow of the British Academy. Selected bibliography *Coale, Ansley J.

The two models differ by their engines: the SR400 engine has a lower displacement, achieved with a different crankshaft and shorter piston stroke and both models feature only kickstarting, i.e., no electric starter. The SR400 has been marketed in the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM) since 1978 and was introduced to Europe, the Americas and Oceania in 2014. Its engine capacity complies with JDM 400 cc licensing restrictions. The SR500 was marketed in Asia and Oceania (1978–1999), North America (1978–1981); and Europe (1978–1983), and was not marketed in the Japanese market. The SR was originally developed under the design credo \\"easy to use\\", and when Yamaha's Technical Director wrenched his ankle while testing a prototype, easier starting became a priority—and Yamaha developed a decompression lever and sight glass system. The SR was styled by Atsushi Ishiyama with Yamaha presenting a pre-production prototype to US dealers in late 1975. Ishiyama said of the bike's styling: \\"Our choice was to design the new SR500 with a strong family image and a strong link to our first four stroke, the XS 650 twin, which was also inspired by British design.\\" SR400 EVAP canister to reduce emissions. Yamaha has marketed the SR400 in the JDM since model year 1978, with a production hiatus for model years 2008–2009. Beginning with model year 2010, the SR400 had fuel injection and a catalyst muffler to comply with tighter emission restrictions. Yamaha began marketing the bike in Europe, Australia and the US in 2014. The SR400 has an air-cooled 4-stroke single cylinder SOHC 2-valve engine with a dry-sump, with the downtubes of the motorcycle's frame serving as the engine's oil reservoir and cooling system, thereby eliminating the need for an external oil cooler, reducing engine pumping losses, and allowing increased ground clearance as well as reduced overall width. The bike's semi-double cradle frame uses high-strength steel. The SR400 had a kick-starter and no electric start. To aid with starting, the bike had a sight glass on the right side of the cylinder head indicating the optimal cylinder position for starting, as well as a decompressor lever on the left handlebar. The fuel injection system has a throttle position sensor on the throttle body; O2 sensor in the top of the exhaust header-pipe; temperature sensor; thermo unit at the upper rear of the cylinder head; and a lean angle sensor to interrupt the fuel injection pump, in case, for example, the bike is on its side. The air filter is a disposable oil-coated paper type held in place by the airbox cover. The electrical system has an automatic cut- out to stop the engine when left idling longer than 20 minutes. The exhaust system has an exhaust pipe coated with a nano-film to prevent discoloration and includes a 3-way honeycomb-type catalytic converter to meet EU and US (50 state) emission requirements. The instrumentation includes a cable-driven analog speedometer and tachometer with a stainless steel bezel, fuel low-level indicator, engine-trouble warning, turn signal, neutral, and high beam light indicators. The left-side handlebar controls include hazard, horn, high and low beam control, flash-to-pass switch and turn indicator controls. The right side controls include the hazard light switch as well as the engine kill switch. With 18\\" front and rear tires, the SR400 has spoked wheels with lightweight aluminium rims, front disc and rear drum brakes as well as a center stand, chromed fenders, headlight pod and grab bar. A sealed Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) battery is located underneath the seat, on its side. Earlier models had CDI ignition; post-2010 models have transistor controlled ignition (TCI). SR500 The 1978–1979 US version of the SR500 had front and rear disc brakes while the 1980–1981 models had a front disc and rear drum brake, while the European 78–79 models had spoked wheels, front disc and rear drum brake. Cast aluminum wheels on US models (rear disk brake) for 78-79 were not tubeless applicable while (drum brake) for 80-81 were stamped tubeless applicable and so equipped. By the end of 1981, the SR500 was discontinued in the US market, while continuing in Europe and Japan. The model ended production in 1999. The SR500 employed a slightly modified version of its large single-cylinder from the XT500/TT500 and had electronic ignition as well as a handle bar mounted compression release lever to make kick starting much easier.

It was also the tenth episode of the show's third season. The episode was written by Bob Daily and directed by Larry Shaw. It aired on November 26, 2006. Title scenes were cut due to time. Plot Gabrielle convinces Vern to take a girl named Amy Pearce out of the pageant because Gabrielle doesn't think she has the gravitas to pull it off. Vern doesn't want to because her mother died a year ago and she suffered enough already, but eventually sees Gabrielle's point. They meet with Amy's father, Bill, to tell him they're taking Amy off. Gabrielle immediately changes her mind because she has a crush on Bill and wants to date him. The two end up getting along and getting affectionate with each other. When Amy finds out about their relationship, she is furious and orders Gabrielle to stop seeing him. She has made plans with her best friend, Sheri, to have their parents marry each other so they can become sisters. Gabrielle makes a plan to rip Amy and Sheri apart; she sets Amy and Sheri up to dance with each other at the pageant. Sheri is upset, because she thinks Amy is a terrible dancer, also revealing that she cares more about winning the pageant than their friendship. Per Gabrielle's advice, Sheri tries to talk to Amy about why she doesn't want to dance with her, but Amy gets mad and their friendship is ruined. Gabrielle's plan has worked, and now she can continue seeing Bill. Ian tells Susan his parents are flying in from Chicago, Illinois and he wants her to cook dinner. Susan tries to convince him she lacks talent in the cooking department, but he is insistent and she reluctantly agrees. She asks Bree for help, and Bree says yes. The residents of Wisteria Lane are shocked when Mike is arrested for Monique's murder. The dirt on Mike's wrench that Mrs. McCluskey advised him to clean off is revealed to be Monique's blood. Edie breaks up with him, which leaves Mike helpless for bail. That is, until Susan offers to get him a lawyer. During the housewives' weekly poker game, which is being held at Bree's house, Susan and Bree have a fight. Susan wants Bree to tell the police that she thinks Orson killed Monique, but Bree countered that she had \\"concerns\\", which disappeared when Mike was arrested. Bree tells Susan that she won't help her with dinner, and Susan storms out, but not before she steals the key to Orson's dental office. When she's snooping around the office, she learns that Orson was committed to a mental hospital starting in 1981 and lasting for about a year due to psychological depression. On the way home, Susan picks up fried chicken for Ian's parents. Ian is furious when she's 40 minutes late. His parents couldn't come because their flight was canceled due to a snowstorm. Ian promises to get Mike a lawyer and pay every cent of it, as long as Susan agrees to never have contact with him again, otherwise he'll just fall in love with her again. Susan reluctantly agrees. The residents of Wisteria Lane have a holiday block party. Art dresses as Santa Claus, but all the parents won't let their kids near him, because Mrs. McCluskey has spread the word that he's a pedophile. Art's sister, Rebecca, confronts Lynette by telling her that her and Art's lives are ruined because she couldn't keep her mouth shut. She tells her that the pictures were just Art's swimming students whom he was proud of. Lynette isn't convinced and gets together with a few of her friends to discuss Art. She is surprised to find them organizing a protest to go on in front of Art's house, and when she expresses that she didn't anticipate this, Tom replies \\"You tell people Frankenstein's on the loose then you're surprised to see the torch-wielding villagers?\\". The protest ends up getting out of hand, leading Tom to put the kids to bed early, not wanting them to witness such an event. Lynette tries to stop the protest, claiming that she doesn't feel safe, and an ambulance comes to take away Rebecca, who is in cardiac arrest. As Art is leaving to go in the ambulance with Rebecca, a protester throws a rock at his head. Lynette tries to apologize but Art won't hear of it. Later Rebecca dies, and Lynette apologizes to Art for everything. Art tells her that while he was taking care of Rebecca, he didn't want to do anything that would hurt her, saying he couldn't 'slip up'. However, now that she's gone, he can go back to his old ways. He tells Lynette to take care of her 'beautiful' family and informs her that he's moving away. This suggests that he either is a pedophile or is pretending to sound like one as revenge for Lynette ruining his life and causing his sister's death. Bree pays Orson a visit at his office and tells him that if he doesn't tell her the complete truth about Alma and Monique, she will divorce him. Orson tells her that he never loved Alma, as Gloria pushed the two together. When Alma learned she was pregnant, they got married. However, Alma had a miscarriage a month after the wedding. He wanted to divorce her, but Gloria told him it was not the Christian thing to do. He lived in a loveless life until he met Monique. He knew having an affair was wrong, but he didn't care because he loved Monique more than he loved anyone else, until he met Bree. After hearing the story, Bree takes him back. She and Orson buy Gloria a condo in a retirement community as a \\"Christmas present\\". When Bree is not around, Orson tells Gloria that he told Bree everything, but Gloria doesn't believe him because he still has secrets. Orson responds by saying that she has secrets too, and if she doesn't reveal his, he won't reveal hers. Gloria calls someone on her cell phone and tells the person that Bree took Orson back. This mysterious person comes to pick Gloria up — and it's revealed to be Alma, alive and well. Ratings This episode attracted 21.4 million viewers in its original US airing. Cast Although credited, Danielle Van de Kamp (Joy Lauren) does not appear in this episode.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia, on Lake Cargelligo. It is in Lachlan Shire. At the , Lake Cargelligo had a population of 1,479 people. Its name is said to be a corruption of the Aboriginal word kartjellakoo meaning 'he had a coolamon'. Alternatively it is derived from Wiradhuri and Ngiyambaa \\"gajal\\" for water container with suffix \\"lugu\\" for \\"her\\" or \\"his\\". In 2016, it had an indigenous population of 239 (16.2%) and an Australian born population of 1,241 (89.7%).  History  The explorers, John Oxley and George Evans, followed the Lachlan River down to Lake Cargelligo in 1817. Lake Cargelligo was known as Cudgelligo (or sometimes Cudgellico) in the 1800s and was officially changed when the railway arrived in 1917.

The plant uses dual axes sun tracking mirrors (heliostats) to reflect solar energy onto central towers to heat up multiple graphite solar storage receivers. The heat is then used to generate electricity via a 3MWe steam turbine generator, related steam cycle plant and controls. The 620 heliostats have a combined reflective surface area of 6 080 m². The plant was constructed using a grant from the Australian Government's Advanced Electricity Storage Technologies (AEST) Program. The plant commenced operation in May 2011. More details on the project can be obtained from the Final Public Report – Commonwealth of Australia Department of Resource, Energy and Tourism, August 2011. By of 2014, the operator had accumulated more than 25,000 hours of operating data from the solar power plant. In 2016, the owner announced plans to dismantle the Lake Cargelligo site for redevelopment. The new site will be used for research and development as well as for demonstration purposes. Construction of the new site is set to begin early 2017.  The lake  As its name would suggest, the town of Lake Cargelligo is situated on a lake fed by the Lachlan River through Lake Curlew. The lake was originally named Regent's Lake by the explorer John Oxley after the prince regent of England at the time. The lake was the primary water source for the early mining town, and has continued to remain an integral source of water for Lake Cargelligo's inhabitants and for all users along the lower Lachlan. These days the lake serves recreational uses as well, bird watchers are by far the largest group of visitors to the lake and surrounds due to the incredible diversity of waterfowl and other rare birds in the district. Boating, fishing and water skiing, also contribute to the town's tourism industry. After many years of drought, it was reported in early 2010 that the lake ran dry for the first time since 1902.http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2801903.htm ABC 7.30 Report 26 January 2010  Gallery  File:Lake Cargelligo Anglican Church 001.JPGLake Cargelligo Anglican Church File:Lake Cargelligo Uniting Church 001.JPGLake Cargelligo Uniting Church File:Lake Cargelligo - Signal Box & Gantry Crane.jpg Lake Cargelligo - signal box & gantry crane File:Lake Cargelligo Water Tower & Turntable.jpg Lake Cargelligo water tower & turntable  References   External links  Category:Towns in the Central West (New South Wales) Category:Lachlan Shire Category:Mining towns in New South Wales ","title":"Lake Cargelligo, New South Wales"},{"id":"7656813","text":"Puyuma (also Pinuyumayan) may refer to: *the Puyuma people, tribe, are one of the tribal groups of the Taiwanese aborigines.

It was manufactured and sold by a company of the same name. The special front wheel contains a rotating flywheel driven by a rechargeable-battery-powered motor that spins at high RPMs like a gyroscope. This flywheel spins significantly faster than the front wheel rolls and acts as a gyroscope, even when the bike is moving slowly, such as when the rider is starting. The flywheel causes the front wheel to respond to a lean by precessing, that is the front wheel turns toward the direction of the lean, which can help provide stability at low speeds, whether riding straight or turning. Jyrobike technology was intended to help children and adults learning to ride a bicycle, and people who lack confidence in their balance and mobility skills.  History  The inventors of the technology which the original Gyrowheel was based on were Debbie Sperling, Hannah Murnen, Nathan Sigworth, and Augusta Niles, who conceived and tested the concept between 2004 and 2007 as part of a graduate project at the Thayer School of Engineering. Their invention won the 2006 Break Through Award from Popular Mechanics. In 2010 Daniella Reichstetter, a fellow Dartmouth student, licensed the technology from the inventors and set up a company based in San Francisco, USA called The Gyrobike Inc. The company launched a working model based on the initial invention, called Gyrowheel, which was a stand-alone front wheel toy accessory that replaced the conventional bicycle front wheel. The company communicated ‘once attached, Gyrowheel transforms a normal bicycle into a Gyrobike’. This message led to confusion because the inventors never engineered a complete Gyrobike bicycle nor did the company sell bicycles or Gyrobikes, but only the front wheel. Gyrowheel was manufactured in 12\\" and 16\\" wheel sizes, and was marketed as a toy accessory for children. Gyrowheel was rated a “Top Toy” of Toy Fair 2010 in New York by industry In October 2013 UK- based entrepreneur Robert Bodill acquired the intellectual property rights, then raised capital funding and set up Jyrobike Limited in December 2013. The Gyrobike trademark is owned by Jyrobike Limited, which holds global patents for a “system for providing gyroscopic stabilization to a two- wheeled vehicle”, protecting the invention. In 2014, Jyrobike launched a Kickstarter campaign that raised $185,818 from 872 supporters. On November 25, 2014, Team Jyrobike announced a 9-month delay in delivering bikes. That was their last update. As of July, 2019, the jyrobike.com url is no longer active.

The workshop's mission is to give students, performers, and educators an opportunity to meet and share ideas, talents, and opinions about the world of trombone. ETW regularly hosts participants throughout the nation and abroad. The workshop is held at Brucker Hall—The U.S. Army Band's state-of-the-art performance center—located on historic Fort Myer, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. ETW is the only professionally organized and staffed trombone workshop or conference in the United States. Soloists, educators, and students, as well as university and college trombone ensembles from around the world, attend the workshop annually. The workshop hosts a number of solo and ensemble competitions for performers of all ages. Over 1,000 students and professional trombonists have submitted audition tapes for the various competitions sponsored by ETW since 1993. Competitions include the National Solo Competition, the National Jazz Solo Competition, the National Jazz Ensemble Competition, and the National Trombone Quartet Competition. Soloists have the opportunity to perform with the music ensembles from the U.S. Army Band to include the U.S. Army Orchestra, Concert Band, and Blues Jazz Ensemble. All events are open and free to the public. Activities include concerts, master classes, recitals, lectures and clinics by the leading artists of the day. The workshop annually features premier performances of new works and arrangements for tenor and bass trombone. There are no registration fees. History In 1978, John Marcellus, former principal trombonist with the National Symphony Orchestra, along with John Melick, former trombone instructor at Towson State University, founded the Eastern Trombone Workshop at Towson State University in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1981 the workshop moved to Florida State University, under the direction of trombone instructor William Cramer. The U.S. Navy Band took control of the workshop in 1986, thus bringing the event to the Washington area. In 1993, U.S. Army Band solo trombonist Scott Shelsea, with support of Colonel Bryan Shelburn, commander of the U.S. Army Band, took hold of the reins of ETW.
