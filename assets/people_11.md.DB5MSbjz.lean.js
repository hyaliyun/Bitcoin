Her research primarily focuses on population ecology and biological control of invasive species.  Education  Cappuccino received her bachelor's degree in biology from Brown University in 1982. She went on to earn her Ph.D. from Cornell University in ecology and evolutionary biology in 1988. Her thesis was titled Comparative Population Dynamics of Two Goldenrod Aphids: Spatial Patterns and Temporal Constancy, which compared two species that feed on the Solidago altissima: the Uroleucon nigrotuberculatum and Uroleucon caligatum.  Career and research  Cappuccino worked at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al for five years, researching the spruce budworm in northwestern Qu√©bec. Currently, she teaches a number of classes on plants and plant-animal interactions and works as a co-supervisor for undergraduate honors students and graduate students at the Central Experimental Farm. Her current research works to help her local community combat invasive species using natural population control methods. The first invasive species Cappuccino and her fellow researchers approached was the dog-strangling vine, an Eastern European vine that was sweeping across Canada, strangling plants and surviving winters, making anthropogenic removal very difficult. The researches retrieved one of the vine's natural predators, the Hypena opulenta moth, and saw successful results with decreased vines across the areas where this tactic was implemented while not affecting local species. Her current research is on population control of the invasive lily leaf beetle, which also involves using the species' natural predator, the Tetrastichus setifer, a non- stinging parasitic wasp that only attacks the beetle. The wasps lay eggs on the beetle larvae, and the wasp larvae eat the beetle larvae from the inside. Results with the lily leaf beetle have been found to be up to 90 percent effective. = Awards and honors = Cappuccino's paper The Nature of Population Stability in Eurosta solidaginis, A Nonoutbreaking Herbivore of Goldenrod was chosen for the 1993 George Mercer Award, an award given by the Ecological Society of America for ecological researchers under the age of 40.‚ÄúMercer Award: Naomi Cappuccino.‚Äù Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, vol. 74, no. 4, 1993, pp. 283‚Äì283.

Several major media organizations have filmed in the complex, such as Disney/ABC, NBC and CBS and. In addition Shop Studios has created store windows for Armani Exchange and Yves Saint Laurent. History Rosas saved much of his earnings as one of Manhattan's first pedicab drivers and then with his partner Eric Steding, rented a small studio and turned it into a rapidly growing art production company. Eventually they moved the business to a large multistory building on 49th Street before relocating to and even larger one 39th Street West. Several major audiovisual production companies have filmed in the complex, such as Disney, NBC, CBS and ABC . In particular, Shop Studios has set up shop windows for Armani Exchange and Yves Saint Laurent. In April 2017, a \\"Pop Up\\" exhibition produced by Red Splat Productions and Gallery X took place at Shop Studios to present unpublished works by street artist Richard Hambleton a contemporary of Keith Haring and Jean Michel Basquiat . The exhibition was held in conjunction with the 2017 edition of the Tribeca Film Festival and a preview of the documentary \\"Shadowman\\". Founders Jacques Rosas (born 1959 in Stockton, California) is an American artist, political activist, entrepreneur and co-founder of the art production company Shop Studios. Rosas lived in Stockton, California until his first school year, when his family moved to Colusa California. He studied at San Joaquin Delta College and at the University of California at Irvine. Rosas started working as a model and actor, but soon turned to a career as an impresario. Openly gay with his family and friends, he remained discreet about his sexual orientation until he was a victim of violence because of it ( gay bashing). This beating drew him into political militancy, and also initiated his artistic career. In the 1990s, Rosas worked for the international environmental group Greenpeace, where he focused his efforts on combating the destruction of the ozone layer. His work with Greenpeace saw him move to New York City. His first partner there was the actor and composer Keith Pruitt (1961-2008), with whom he was again the victim of a violent incident because of his homosexuality. This second event led Rosas to create the urban art project called \\"Call Me Ishmael\\", which draws outlines with chalk drawing bodies (chalk outlines) in places where gays have been assaulted. The second incident of violence suffered by Rosas prevented him from working for Greenpeace, at a juncture at which he was going to collaborate on a new campaign. After his convalescence, he drove one of Manhattan's first pedicabs before co-founding Shop Studios. His most recent work is a series of abstract paintings which use forms and bright colors as well as a series of pop paintings of manhole covers with reliefs of metal joints and painted on. Rosas studied art at the Art Students League of New York and at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re in Paris.

Barriers to pro-environmental behaviour are the numerous factors that hinder individuals when they try to adjust their behaviours toward living more sustainable lifestyles. Generally, these barriers can be separated into larger categories: psychological, social/cultural, financial and structural. Psychological barriers are considered internal, where an individuals' knowledge, beliefs and thoughts affect their behaviour. Social and cultural barriers are contextual, where an individual's behaviour is affected by their surroundings (e.g. neighbourhood, town, city, etc.). Financial barriers are simply a lack of funds to move toward more sustainable behaviour (e.g. new technologies, electric cars). Structural barriers are external and often impossible for an individual to control, such as lack of governmental action, or locality of residence that promotes car use as opposed to public transit.  Internal/psychological barriers  Identifying psychological barriers to pro-environmental behaviour is key to the design of successful behaviour change interventions. Scholars have identified several different categories of psychological barriers to pro-environmental action. A known researcher in the field, environmental psychologist Robert Gifford, has identified 33 of these barriers, barriers that he has termed ‚ÄúThe Dragons of Inaction.‚Äù The Dragons are separated into seven categories: Limited Cognition, Ideologies, Social Comparison, Sunk Costs, Discredence, Perceived Risks, and Limited Behaviour. Below are the seven categories, integrated with additional barriers identified by other researchers. Other psychologists have argued that the attempt to identify psychological barriers to environmental behavior is problematic when used to explain societal inaction on climate change. = Limited cognition = Limited cognition barriers are barriers that arise from a lack of knowledge and awareness about environmental issues. For example, with a key environmental issue like climate change, a person might not engage in pro- environmental behaviour because they are: unaware that climate change is occurring; or aware that climate change is an issue, but are ill-informed about the science of climate change; or lacking information about how they could address the issue. For those who are aware of current environmental issues, self-efficacy is an important barrier to action, where individuals often feel powerless in achieving large goals such as mitigating global climate change. Moreover, lack of motivation to change one's behaviour is correlated with the belief that individuals are incapable of performing effective pro-environmental actions. = Ideologies = Ideological barriers are created by pre-conceived ideas and the way an individual thinks about the world. Ideologies that can create barriers to pro-environmental behaviour can include a strong belief in free-enterprise capitalism, a fatalistic belief that a higher power is in control, and a belief that technology can solve all environmental issues. Accordingly, tactics such as environmental policies have prompted a tendency to struggle against perceived threats to one‚Äôs freedom and comfortable lifestyle. This barrier is namely present in Western countries where individuals enjoy comparatively high levels of objective and subjective wellbeing due to socioeconomic status. It has been noted that to live within environmental limits, there is a need to make changes to the comfortable aspects of Western lifestyles, for example, reducing meat consumption, the use of airplanes, and use of electronic gadgets with short life-spans. Western cultural norms associate meat consumption with wealth, status and luxury, and meat consumption per capita in the richest 15 nations of the world is 750% higher than in the poorest 24 nations. A shift in values may be difficult, as people‚Äôs life goals are formed by their ideas of social progress, personal status, and success through careers, higher incomes and consumption. Moreover, there exist deep structural and cultural roots that couple the macro-level of financial, property or labour institutions to the micro-level of individualistic, utilitarian values. These roots are linked to the current economic growth paradigm, which can be defined as a worldview that maintains that economic growth is both good and necessary. = Social comparison = Social comparison barriers include the comparison of actions with those of others to determine the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù behaviour, whether it be beneficial or harmful for the environment. This means that social comparison barriers can also facilitate pro-environmental behaviour. For example, people will alter their energy consumption to replicate the reported usage of their neighbours. Moreover, if individuals believe those around them are not actively engaging in pro-environmental behaviour, they are less likely to engage in it themselves because they believe this to be unfair. = Sunk costs = Sunk cost barriers are the investments (not necessarily financial) of an individual that in turn restrict alternative possibilities for change, or in this circumstance, for pro-environmental behaviour. One example of a financial investment is car ownership, where the individual will be less likely to use alternative modes of transportation. Habits are considered a Sunk Costs Dragon as well because they are very difficult to change (e.g. eating habits). Individuals are also deeply invested in their life goals and aspirations, even if achieving them will harm the environment. Place attachment is considered here as well, where an individual who feels no place attachment to their home will be less likely to act pro-environmentally in that place than one who loves where they live. Additional barriers are inconvenience and time-related pressures, which are suggested as reasons why individuals go back to unsustainable habits. An individual may find it annoying and inconvenient to compost if they do not have access to municipal composting, for example, and if one is pressed for time they may choose to use their car rather than wait for public transit. = Discredence = Discredence barriers generally involve disbelief in environmental issues and/or distrust in government officials and scientists. Complete denial of climate change and other environmental issues is becoming less prominent, but it continues to persist. Skepticism is still apparent in countries where there are efforts to shape public opinion through mediums such as conservative think tanks and media outlets. Moreover, mass media is the primary source of information on climate change in many countries, therefore depending on the individual, they will either trust or ignore the information they receive which will vary from one media outlet to the next based on different views. Distrust in government has become a prevalent issue recently. In the United States for example, Americans have been polled every year about their confidence in their country‚Äôs institutions (e.g. the Supreme Court, Congress, the Presidency, and the health-care establishment), and there has been a reported collapse in trust over time (12% in 2017). From an environmental standpoint, the Trump administration has significantly diminished regulations that were put in place by the former administration to meet environmental standards. Examples of policy changes include pulling out of the Paris Agreement, loosening regulations on toxic air pollution, and issuing an executive order that called for a 30% increase in logging on public lands. There is a 97% scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, yet there is still not enough being done to meet global temperature targets of staying below a 1.5 degrees Celsius increase (see Paris Agreement). = Perceived risk = Risk perception barriers include worrying about whether financial or temporal investments will pay off. An example of a financial investment is solar panels which are initially costly. A temporal investment can simply be spending the time to do research on the topic instead of doing something else. There exists the concept of psychological distance, where people tend to discount future risks when making trade-offs between cost and benefits, and instead prioritize immediate day-to-day concerns. Spatial distance allows individuals to disregard any risks, and instead consider them more likely for other people and places than for themselves. This barrier can simply be thought of as \\"out of sight, out of mind.\\" Additionally, people typically underestimate the likelihood of being affected by natural disasters, as well as the degree to which others are concerned about environmental issues. Furthermore, the human brain privileges experience over analysis: personal experiences with extreme weather events can influence risk perceptions, beliefs, behaviour and policy support, whereas statistical information by itself means very little to most people. = Limited behaviour = Limited behaviour barriers may include people choosing easier, yet less effective, pro-environmental behavioural changes (e.g. recycling, metal straws), and the rebound effect, which occurs when a positive environmental behaviour is followed by one that negates it (e.g. saving money with an electric car to then buy a plane ticket).  Contextual barriers  = Social and cultural factors = Research has also shown that how people support and engage in pro-environmental behaviour is also affected by contextual factors (i.e. social, economic, and cultural); people with diverse cultural backgrounds have different perspectives and priorities, and thus, they may respond to the same policies and interventions in different ways with regionally differentiated world views playing an important role. This means that people will use different excuses for their behaviours depending on contextual factors. Research has shown that information has a greater impact on behaviour if it is tailored to the personal situations of consumers and resonates with their important values. This suggests that, for example, policies developed to reduce and mitigate climate change would be more effective if they were developed specifically for the people whose behaviour they were targeting. People are social beings who respond to group norms: behaviour and decision-making has been shown to be affected by social norms and contexts. Demographic variables like age, gender and education, can have a variety of effects on pro-environmental behaviour, depending on the issue and context. However, when considering the effects of socio-demographics on individual perceptions of climate change, a recent study reported a meta- analysis which found that the largest demographic correlation with the belief of human-caused climate change is political affiliation (e.g. conservative views often mean less support for climate mitigation). = Economic factors = The cost of sustainable alternatives and financial measures used to support new technologies can also be a barrier to pro-environmental behaviour. Households may have severe budgetary constraints that discourage them from investing in energy-efficient measures. In addition, individuals may fear that project costs will not be recovered prior to a future sale of a property. In other cases however, environment-friendly behaviours may be undertaken for non-environmental reasons, such as to save money or to improve health (e.g. biking or walking instead of driving). = Structural barriers = Structural barriers are large-scale systemic barriers that may be perceived as being objective and external, and can be highly influential and near impossible to control, even when one wishes to adopt more pro-environmental behaviour. For example, lack of organizational and governmental action on sustainability is considered a barrier for individuals looking to participate in sustainable practices. Further examples of structural barriers include: low problem awareness at the local level caused by a low priority for adaptation at higher institutional levels, and missing leadership by certain key actors leading to an absence of appropriate decision-making routines. Other structural barriers reported from a Vancouver-based study include: term limits imposed on politicians that affect council‚Äôs ability to make long-term decisions; budgetary cycles that force planning based on three year terms, rather than long-term planning; and hierarchical systems that inhibit flexibility and innovation. Research has shown that individuals may not behave in accordance with environmental sustainability when they have little control over the outcome of a situation. An example of a structural choice that can influence an individuals' use of high carbon transport, occurs when cities governments allow sprawling neighbourhoods to develop without associated public transit infrastructure. The concept of barriers has also been defined in relation to adaptive capacity, the ability of a system to respond to environmental changes; a barrier can either be a reason for potential adaptive capacity not being translated into action, or a reason for the existence of low adaptive capacity.

Description The church was built between 1751-1752, originally along an elliptical plan with a complex dome, and consecrated in 1768 by the archbishop of Turin, Francesco Luserna Rorengo di Ror√† The addition of two chapels in 1890 altered the layout to resemble more a Greek Cross. The sober neoclassical facade was designed by Barnaba Panizza and added in 1830. Originally the church was affiliated with the Order of the Discalced Trinitarians, but later it was attached to the confraternities of the Santissimo Viatico and later the Sacro Cuore di Ges√π (Holy Heart of Jesus). At the beginning of the 19th century it was affiliated with the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1910, the church was named a sanctuary and proclaimed a national monument.

As part of the Emergency Shipbuilding Program the US Navy provided some of the capital to start Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding at Port Gardner Bay in Everett, Washington. Everett-Pacific was sold in 1945 to the Pacific Car and Foundry, who was already a major manufacturer of railcars and trucks. Pacific Car and Foundry was building barges for the US Navy during World War 2 at plants in Renton, Seattle and Tacoma in the state of Washington. The lease for the shipyard in Everett, Washington ended in 1949 and the yard closed. Pacific Car and Foundry in 1972 changed its name to Paccar Inc. to reflect its major products. The Everett- Pacific shipyard site later became part of Western Gear, a heavy machinery manufacturer. in 1987 the shipyard became part of Naval Station Everett. Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding was started by William Pigott, Jr. a Seattle businessmen and his brother Paul Pigott (1900-1961). William Pigott, Jr. was born in 26 Aug. 1895 in Pueblo, CO and died on 8 July 1947 in San Francisco, CA.

Each Section had a 165 feet beam, a 75 feet molded depth and had 10,000 tons lifting capacity each. They are also known as Advance Base Sectional Docks (ABSD). Sections could be put together to lift larger ships. AFDB were needed to repair battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and large auxiliary ships. AFDB-1 Artisan had 10 sections (A to J) for a total lift of 100,000 tons and was 1,000 feet long with all 10 sections installed. AFDB-1 to 7 were built between 1943 and 1945 and then towed to remote navy bases. An AFDB would have a crew of 600 to 1000 men, have a fresh-water distilling plant and be self-sustaining. They had a rail traveling 15-ton capacity crane with an 85-foot radius and two or more support barges. To pump out the water in the tanks there were two 24-inch discharge pumps on each section, each pump rated 15,000 gpm. For power there were two 350-kw diesel AC generators on each section, producing 440 volts 3-phase 60-cycle power. Had steam plants to run the pumps. Each section could store 65,000 gal. of fuel oil, this was to supply the ships under repair. For the crew to live next to the AFDB the Navy had barracks ships called APL, that dock next to the AFDB. *USS Artisan (ABSD-1) (A-J) =Medium Auxiliary Floating Dry Docks (AFDM)= Everett- Pacific's USS Resourceful (AFDM-5) and under repair USNS Spica (T-AFS-9) at Subic Bay Everett-Pacific's AFDM are 8,000 tons and 622 feet long.

Architect William H. Dennis built the church in 1883. The church building, located 704 11th Ave. S., was home to many Scandinavian parishioners in the early decades of existence. The church initially served a large immigrant population in the city of Minneapolis, and the congregation often heard from pastors who traveled from Sweden and Norway. However, as the downtown population changed, the church congregants also shifted. By the 1960s, many Lutherans attended newer churches in suburban Twin Cities neighborhoods. By 2014, the church had less than 100 members, who sold the building. The church was built of yellow brick with red brick accents. The sanctuary was built to be illuminated by the tall, narrow stain glass windows. The 800-seat sanctuary features a curved balcony and the pipes of a 1904 Estey organ (though the actual organ was replaced in 1955 by M.P. Moller). The architect of the building was known for French Renaissance Revival works in Minnesota, including the Vendome Hotel on the corner of Fourth Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis. Several additions were added onto the original structure throughout the 1940s‚Äì1970s. The building's block consists only of one other building: another large brick church on the northwest corner. Both are surrounded by parking lots. Hope Community Church owns both buildings and the parking lots. Hope, a 75-year-old congregation of more than 1,500 members, is affiliated with the Evangelical Free Church of America. The congregation serendipitously purchased the Augustana Lutheran Church building, allowing them to expand from the other church on the block, which they had owned since 2003.

With various expansions the Olympic Club's complex of buildings grew to cover a whole city block in what is now called the Bywater section of New Orleans. It included a gymnasium and other facilities for members, as well as a large arena lit by electric lighting - still something of a novelty at the time. The original arena seated 3,500; in response to growing success it was expanded to seat 10,000. Events While the club hosted a variety of events, including chess matches, it was by far best known for boxing matches. Sports writer S. Derby Gisclair called it \\"the epicenter of professional boxing\\" in the era. The most famous of boxing matches held at the Olympic Club were a series of World Championship matches held on consecutive days in September of 1892, including Featherweight and Lightweight championship matches, cumulating in James J. Corbett defeating John L. Sullivan for the World Heavyweight Championship. On April 6, 1893, the longest fight in professional boxing history took place at the Olympic Club, as Andy Bowen fought Jack Burke for the Lightweight Championship. The match lasted 110 rounds, over seven hours and 19 minutes (each round lasting three minutes) before referee John Duffy declared a \\"no contest\\", both men having become too dazed and tired to come out of their corners.

The group was named after Gaetano Bresci, a New York anarchist who killed King Umberto I of Italy.  Origins  In July 1900, the anarchist Gaetano Bresci assassinated the King Umberto I of Italy. Several months earlier, Bresci had been living in New York City. According to Thomas Tunney of the New York Police Department, Bresci had attended an Elizabeth Street meeting of anarchists where he accused the others of being cowards and they accused him of being a police spy. The meeting was called off as its heat threatened to attract police attention, but Bresci was incensed and it is implied that this affront precipitated into his plot to return to Italy and become a martyr. A group of New York City anarchists subsequently formed as the Bresci Circle, in Bresci's honor. By 1914, almost 600 members met regularly at a rundown house in East Harlem. Their speakers included Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. The group also affiliated with the Wobblies, who were closely affiliated with anarchism.  Activities  A plot to bomb the Rockefellers increased police interest in the group. Three months following the 1914 Ludlow Massacre, the type of capitalist violence that incensed the Galleanists, a group of anarchists carried a bomb to the Tarrytown estate of the Ludlow coal mine owner, John D. Rockefeller. They miscalculated, both in failing to trigger the device and since Rockefeller was out of town. A member of the Circle was arrested near the estate on July 4, 1914. The anarchists carried the bomb back to a tenement in the Italian section of East Harlem (near the Bresci Circle headquarters). Later that day, a bomb's accidental explosion demolished half of the building and killed three anarchists. While no group took responsibility for four additional bombings in 1914, the police continued to suspect the Bresci Circle. In October 1914, bombs exploded at St. Patrick's Cathedral and the priest's house at St. Alphonsus Church. There were also attacks on the Bronx County Courthouse and The Tombs, a jail. The New York City bomb squad, recently inaugurated under Thomas Tunney, sent an undercover detective into the group, but his aggressive behavior and lack of Italian language led him to be twice suspected and unsuccessfully tried for spying. He later withdrew from the group and the police provisioned another detective and Italian speaker, Amedeo Polignani, to infiltrate the group. = Abarno and Carbone = Abarno and Carbone in court As the Circle planned a repeat attack for March 1915, the police were ready. Two young men dressed as laborers entered St. Patrick's at Mass with lit and later concealed cigars. One placed a device from his coat pocket on the floor and lit it with his cigar. A woman who had been cleaning the marble floor stopped his exit and a nearby, elderly man smothered the device's fuse. Another nearby large man grabbed the accomplice. The events transpired with such rapidity that few of the service's participants noticed. The scrubwoman, elderly man, and large man had all been planted members of the police. The bomb squad chief had followed the anarchists by limousine, and fifty disguised officers were deployed at the church. The bomb squad stood for photographs. Frank Abarno and Carmine Carbone were convicted for the attempted bombing and were sentenced to Sing Sing for six to twelve years, half of the maximum. The undercover Polignani received multiple death threats upon his identity's reveal. Technical expertise was Polignani's entree into the group, where he used the name \\"Frank Baldo\\". Polignani's account of meeting Abarno and Carbone differs from their own. Polignani said that he was approached by Carbone, who suggested the church as a target. The police added that Abarno and Carbone were also impatient with their peers' caution. Abarno and Carbone, who accused the police of entrapment and frameup, said that Polignani accosted them after a meeting and suggested both the use of dynamite and the church target, that the plot and bombs were of Polignani's own design. In time, the undercover detective purchased supplies and a room in which the three made two bombs of sulfur, black antimony, potassium chlorate, and brown sugar, which they packaged in soap tins and to which they attached iron rods with coat hanger wire as shrapnel. The day of the attack, Carbone said that he had stayed late at work and needed sleep, so Polignani and Abarno walked together to the church, where hundreds congregated. Polignani and Abarno briefly sat in the tenth row and appeared to be praying. Abarno then left his bomb near the north altar, but later claimed to not light the fuse. He was immediately arrested. National newspapers presented the failed bombing as proof of a larger conspiracy and presented Polignani as a hero. The bomb squad sensationalized the arrests and spoke grandly of the pair's other targets. Photographs of the undercover scrubwomen and the Fire Department Bureau of Combustibles' chief inspector, whose face showed burn marks from a prior bomb, enhanced the proof. An important aspect of the sensationalization and police account was that Abarno and Carbone had received their bomb-making training from a handbook and not from Polignani. Labor activists and anarchists suspected Polignani as an agent provocateur since he featured prominently in the plot and had purchased the bomb components. The police had duplicated Carbone's copy of La Salute √® in voi, an Italian-language bomb-making handbook circulated among Galleanists, which Carbone had purchased from the Bresci Circle and passed through Abarno to Polignani. The police insinuated that simple possession of the handbook, which was never mentioned by name, was evidence of both Abarno and Carbone's technical expertise and bad intentions, but the church bomb design was based on that of fireworks and not of the handbook. Abarno and Carbone's legal defense revolved around La Salute √® in voi and their right to read any books of any kind, including bomb-making handbooks. After their arrests and before receiving lawyers, Abarno told the press that he had learned bombmaking from Carbone's handbook, and Carbone asserted in broken English that he didn't know the handbook's contents upon purchasing it. After Abarno credited the handbook with deranging him, in appeal for clemency during arraignment, the prosecution used seditious books to show the anarchists' intents. A chemist testified that the explosive's power did not exceed that of a firework. Literature professor Ann Larabee concluded that the handbook's role was to sully Abarno and Carbone, having no proof of connection to the crime. The case rekindled fear of easily accessible bomb-making instructions and sensationalism around anarchism.

Some stories about light-emitting gems may have been based on luminescent and phosphorescent minerals such as diamonds. Mineralogical luminosity  Thermoluminescence from heating chlorophane specimens on a hotplate. Triboluminescence from rubbing together two quartz crystals. First, it will be useful to introduce some mineralogical terminology for gemstones that can glow when exposed to light, friction, or heat. Note that the following discussion will omit modern techniques such as X-rays and ultraviolet light that are too recent to have influenced folklore about luminous gems. Luminescence is spontaneous emission of light by a substance not resulting from heat, as distinguished from incandescence, which is light emitted by a substance as a result of heating. Luminescence is caused by the absorption of energy that is released in small amounts. When the energy comes from light or other electromagnetic radiation, it is referred to as photoluminescence; which is divisible between fluorescence when the glow ceases immediately with the excitation and phosphorescence when the glow continues beyond the period of excitation. Two types of luminescent phenomena are relevant to crystalline materials. Triboluminescence generates light through the breaking of chemical bonds in a material when it is rubbed, pulled apart, scratched, or crushed. Thermoluminescence re-emits previously absorbed electromagnetic radiation upon being heated (e.g., thermoluminescence dating). The American geologist Sydney Hobart Ball, who wrote an article on \\"Luminous Gems, Mythical and Real\\", outlined the history of discoveries about luminescent and phosphorescent minerals. Most diamonds are triboluminescent if rubbed with a cloth, and a few are photoluminescent after exposure to direct sunlight. Both diamonds and white topaz may phosphoresce if heated below red heat. The phosphorescent quality of diamonds when heated by sunlight is usually believed to have been first revealed by Albertus Magnus (c. 1193-1280) and it was apparently rediscovered by Robert Boyle in 1663, who also found that some diamonds will luminesce under pressure. According to Prafulla Chandra Ray, the Indian king Bhoja (r. 1010‚Äì1055) knew that diamonds can phosphoresce (Ball 1938: 496). The luminescent Bologna Stone (impure barite), which was discovered by Vincenzo Cascariolo in 1602, was sometimes called \\"\\" (\\"lunar stone\\"), because, like the moon, it gave out in the darkness the light it received from the sun (Kunz 1913: 168). In 1735, the French chemist Charles Fran√ßois de Cisternay du Fay determined that lapis lazuli, emerald, and aquamarine were luminescent. Josiah Wedgwood, in 1792, found phosphoresce from rubbing together two pieces of quartz or of agate, and wrote that the ruby gives \\"a beautiful red light of short continuance.\\" Edmond Becquerel reported in 1861 that ruby fluoresces better than sapphire, red feldspar fluoresces, and crushed orthoclase will flame. In 1833, David Brewster discovered the fluorescence of the mineral fluorite or fluorspar. However, the English naturalist Philip Skippon (1641‚Äì1691) stated that one Monsieur Lort, of Montpellier, France, a \\"counterfeiter\\" of \\"amethysts, topazes, emeralds, and sapphires\\" found that on heating \\"fluor smaragdi\\" (Latin for \\"flowing emerald/beryl/jasper\\") in a pan of coals and afterwards \\"putting it in a dark place (it) shines very much: At the same time several other stones were tried but did not shine.\\" (1732 6: 718). Some fluorite, particularly the variety chlorophane (aka pyroemerald and cobra stone), will become luminescent simply from the heat of one's hand. Chlorophane is unusual for combining the properties of thermoluminescence, triboluminescence, phosphorescence, and fluorescence; it will emit visible spectrum light when rubbed, or exposed to light or heat, and can continue emitting for a long period of time. Among the gravels of the Irtysh River, near Krasnoyarsk, Russia, the German mineralogist Gustav Rose recorded seeing chlorophane pebbles that shone with brilliancy all night long, merely from exposure to the sun's heat. For luminous gem myths, Ball concludes that while it is \\"not impossible that the inventors of certain of the [luminous gem] tales may have been acquainted with the luminosity of gems, in my opinion many of the tales must be of other origin\\" (1938: 497). Scholars have proposed many identifications for myths about luminous gemstones described for over two thousand years. Most frequently rubies or carbuncles (often red garnets), which classical and medieval mineralogists did not differentiate, and less commonly other gems, including diamonds, emeralds, jade, and pearls (Ball 1938: 497). The American sinologist Edward H. Schafer proposes that the phosphorescent \\"emeralds\\" of classical antiquity, such as the brilliantly shining green eyes of the marble lion on the tomb of King Hermias of Atarneus (d. 341 BCE) on Cyprus, were fluorite, even though the Hellenistic alchemists had methods, \\"seemingly magical, of making night-shining gems by the application of phosphorescent paints to stones\\", the most famous being their \\"emeralds\\" and \\"carbuncles.\\" (1963: 238). The names of some luminescent gemstones etymologically derive from \\"glow\\" or \\"fire\\" words (e.g., pyroemerald for \\"chlorophane\\" above). The OED defines pyrope (from Greek Œ†œÖœÅœâœÄœåœÇ, lit. \\"fire-eyed\\")\\" as: \\"In early use applied vaguely to a red or fiery gem, as ruby or carbuncle; (mineralogy) the Bohemian garnet or fire-garnet\\"; and carbuncle or carbuncle-stone (from Latin \\"carbunculus,\\" \\"small glowing ember\\") as: \\"A name variously applied to precious stones of a red or fiery colour; the carbuncles of the ancients (of which Pliny describes twelve varieties) were probably sapphires, spinels or rubies, and garnets; in the Middle Ages and later, besides being a name for the ruby, the term was esp. applied to a mythical gem said to emit a light in the dark.\\" (Ball 1938: 498).

Ball cross-culturally analyzed stories about luminous stones and pearls and found about one hundred variants in ancient, medieval, and modern sources. The wide-ranging locations of the tales comprise all Asia (except Siberia), all Europe (except Norway and Russia), Borneo, New Guinea, the United States, Canada, certain South American countries and Abyssinia, French Congo, and Angola in Africa. The later African and American myths were likely introduced by Europeans. Ball divides legends about luminous gems into three principal themes: light sources, gem mining, and animals (Ball 1938: 497-498). =Light source legends= The first theme is using legendary luminous gems to illuminate buildings, for navigation lights on ships, or sometimes as guiding lights for lost persons (Ball 1938: 498-500). In India, the earliest country in which fine gemstones were known, belief in luminous gems dates back some twenty-five centuries. The c. 700 BCE-300 CE Vishnu Purana states that Vishnu, in his avatar as the many-headed snake Shesha under the name Ananta (\\"Endless\\"), \\"has a thousand heads adorned with the mystical Swastika and in each head a jewel to give light\\" (Ball 1938: 498). The c. 400 BCE-300 CE Hindu classic Mahabharata tells the story of the five Pandava brothers and the raja Babruvahana's palace with its precious stones that \\"shone like lamps so that there was no need for any other light in the assembly.\\" In the c. 100 CE Buddhacarita, the city of Kapila is said to have gems so bright \\"that darkness like poverty could find no place.\\" (Ball 1938: 499). In Classical antiquity, the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484-425 BCE) was the first European to describe luminous gems. The temple of Heracles at Tyre had two great columns, one of gold, the other of smaragdos (, \\"green gems including emerald\\") that \\"shone brightly at night\\" (Harvey 1957: 33, suggesting the phosphorescent \\"false emerald\\" type of fluorspar). Ball says that the \\"wily priests doubtless enclosed a lamp in hollow green glass, to mislead the credulous\\". The Pseudo-Plutarch \\"On Rivers\\", probably written by the Greek grammarian Parthenius of Nicaea (d. 14 CE), states that in the Sakarya River the Aster (, \\"star\\") gem is found, \\"which flames in the dark\\", and thus called Ballen (the \\"King\\") in the Phrygian language (King 1867: 9). The Roman author Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79 CE) described the chrysolampis as an eastern gem, \\"pale by day but of a fiery luster by night\\" (Ball 1938: 499). The Syrian rhetorician Lucian (c. 125-180 CE) describes a statue of the Syrian goddess Atargatis in Hierapolis Bambyce (present-day Manbij) with a gem on her head called Greek lychnis (, \\"lamp; light\\") (Schafer 1963: 237). \\"From this stone flashes a great light in the night-time, so that the whole temple gleams brightly as by the light of myriads of candles, but in the daytime the brightness grows faint; the gem has the likeness of a bright fire.\\" (tr. Strong and Garstang 1913: 72). According to Pliny, the stone is called lychnis because its luster is heightened by the light of a lamp, when its tints are particularly pleasing (Laufer 1915: 58). Although early Chinese classics from the Eastern Zhou dynasty (770‚Äì256 BCE) refer to luminous gems (e.g., \\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\\" discussed below under grateful animals), Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE Han dynasty Records of the Grand Historian has two early references to using them as a source of light. Most Chinese names for shining pearls/gems are compounds of zh≈´ (Áè†, \\"pearl; gem; bead; orb\\"), such as y√®m√≠ngzh≈´ (Â§úÊòéÁè†, \\"night luminous pearl\\"), m√≠ngyu√®zh≈´ (ÊòéÊúàÁè†, \\"luminous moon pearl\\"), and y√®guƒÅngzh≈´ (Â§úÂÖâÁè†, \\"night shining pearl\\"). The \\"House of Tian Jingzhong\\" history records that in 379 BCE, King Wei of Qi boasted to King Hui of Wei, \\"Even a state as small as mine still has ten pearls one inch in diameter that cast radiance over twelve carriages in front and behind them.\\" (tr. Sawyer 2018: n.p.). In the biography of the Han court minister Zou Yang (ÈÑíÈôΩ, fl. 150 BCE), he figuratively uses the terms mingyue zhi zhu (ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁè†, \\"luminous moon pearl\\") and yeguang zhi bi (Â§úÂÖâ‰πãÂ£Å, \\"night shining jade-disk\\") to illustrate how talented people are lost for lack of recommendations, \\"If I were to throw a luminous moon pearl or a night shining jade-disk on a dark road in front of someone, who would not grasp their sword and look startled?\\" The German sinologist August Conrady suggested that the Chinese names mingyuezhizhu and yeguangzhu may have an Indian origin, with analogs in the chandra-k√¢nta (\\"moon-beloved\\") gem that contains condensed moonlight and the harinma·πái (\\"moon-jewel\\") name for emerald (1931: 168-169). Qing dynasty plate with two dragons and a flaming pearl Li Shizhen's 1578 Bencao Gangmu pharmacopeia describes leizhu (Èõ∑Áè†, \\"thunder pearls/beads\\") that the divine dragon shenlong \\"held in its mouth and dropped. They light the entire house at night\\" (tr. Laufer 1912: 64). Chinese dragons are frequently depicted with a flaming pearl or gem under their chin or in their claws. According to the German anthropologist Wolfram Eberhard, the long dragon is a symbol of clouds and rainstorms, and when it plays with a ball or pearl, this signifies the swallowing of the moon by the clouds or thunder in the clouds. The moon frequently appears as a pearl, and thus the dragon with the pearl is equal to the clouds with the moon. The pearl-moon relationship is expressed in the Chinese belief that at full moon pearls are solid balls and at new moon they are hollow. (1968: 239, 382). Rabbinic Judaism includes a number of references to luminous gems. For example, Abraham was allegedly so jealous of his many wives that he incarcerated them in a city of iron with walls so high that neither the sun nor moon could be seen. However, he \\"provided a great bowl filled with jewels which lighted up the whole building\\" (Ball 1938: 499). The first century Rabbi, Rav Huna, says he was fleeing from Roman soldiers and hid in a cave illuminated by a light that was brighter in the night and darker in the day. The best documented of the illumination tales is that of the King of Ceylon's luminous carbuncle or ruby, first mentioned by the Greek traveler Cosmas Indicopleustes in the 6th century and thereafter described by many travelers, the latest of the 17th century. According to Indicopleustes, it was \\"as large as a great pine-cone, fiery red, and when seen flashing from a distance, especially if the sun's rays are playing around it, being a matchless sight\\" (Laufer 1915: 62). The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang's 646 Great Tang Records on the Western Regions locates it in the Buddha Tooth Temple near Anuradhapura, \\"Its magical brilliance illumines the whole heaven. In the calm of a clear and cloudless night it can be seen by all, even at a distance of a myriad li.\\" The Song Scholar Zhao Rukuo's c. 1225 Zhu Fan Zhi (\\"Records of Foreign People\\") says, \\"The king holds in his hand a jewel five inches in diameter, which cannot be burnt by fire, and which shines in (the darkness of) night like a torch. The king rubs his face with it daily, and though he were passed ninety he would retain his youthful looks.\\" (Hirth and Rockhill 1911: 73). Based on this incombustibility, Laufer says this night- shining jewel was probably a diamond (1915: 63). Others state that it \\"serves instead of a lamp at night\\", has \\"the appearance of a glowing fire\\", or of that \\"of a great flame of fire.\\" Due to its luminescence, Marco Polo called it \\"The Red Palace Illuminator\\" (Ball 1938: 499). The English alchemist John Norton wrote a 1470 poem entitled \\"Ordinal, or a manual of the chemical art\\", in which he proposed erecting a gold bridge over the River Thames and illuminating it with carbuncles set on golden pinnacles, \\"A glorious thing for men to beholde\\" (Ashmole 1652: 27). Boats lit by luminous gems are a variant of the illumination idea. Rabbinic Judaism had a tradition that \\"Noah had a luminous stone in the Ark that \\"shone more brightly by night than by day, thus serving to distinguish day and night when the sun and moon were shrouded by dense clouds.\\" (Harvey 1957: 15). The Genesis Rabbah describes the Tzoar that illuminates Noah's Ark (Genesis 6:16) as a luminous gemstone (the King James Version translates as 'window'). The Mormon Book of Ether describes \\"sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass\\", being touched by God's hand so that they might \\"shine forth in darkness.\\" The Jaredites placed a stone fore and aft on each ship and had \\"light continually\\" during their 344-day voyage to America (Ball 1938: 500). The theme of luminous gems guiding mariners and others originated in Europe in the Middle Ages. The earliest is probably the Scandinavian saga of the Visby garnets. In the Hanseatic city Visby, on the island of Gotland, the Church of St. Nicholas had two rose windows with huge garnets in the center, overlooking the Baltic Sea. Sagas say the two gems shone at night as brightly as did the sun at noon and guided mariners safely to port. In 1361 King Valdemar IV of Denmark conquered Gotland, but his rich booty, including the marvelous garnets, sank in the ocean when the king's ship was wrecked on the Kong Karls Land islands (Ball 1938: 500). The relic of the Virgin Mary's wedding ring, which according to different accounts had an onyx, amethyst, or green jasper, was supposedly brought back from the Holy Land in 996 CE. It was placed in the Church of Santa Mustiola, Clusium (modern Chiusi), Italy, and in 1473 the ring was transferred to the Franciscan monastery in that city. One of the monks stole it and fled into the night, but when he repented and promised to return it, the ring emitted a bright light by which he traveled to Perugia. The two cities fought fiercely for the possession of this sacred ring, but in 1486 the Vatican decreed the relic should be placed in the Perugia Cathedral (Ball 1938: 500). The Dutch scholar Alardus of Amsterdam (1491‚Äì1544) relates the history of a luminous \\"chrysolampis\\" (œáœÅœÖœÉœåŒªŒ±ŒºœÄŒπœÇ, \\"gold-gleaming\\") gem set on a golden tablet with other valuable gemstones. Around 975, Hildegard, wife of Dirk II, Count of Holland, dedicated the tablet to Saint Adalbert of Egmond and presented it to Egmond Abbey, where the saint's body reposed. Alardus tells us that the \\"chrysolampis\\" \\"shone so brightly that when the monks were called to the chapel in the nighttime, they could read the Hours without any other light,\\" however this brilliant gem was stolen by one of the monks and thrown into the sea (Kunz 1913: 164). The French chemist Marcellin Berthelot (1888) discovered an early Greek alchemical text \\"from the sanctuary of the temple\\" that says the Egyptians produced \\"the carbuncle that shines in the night\\" from certain phosphorescent parts (\\"the bile\\") of marine animals, and when properly prepared these precious gems would glow so brightly at night \\"that anyone owning such a stone could read or write by its light as well as he could by daylight.\\" (Kunz 1913: 173). =Gem mining legends= Peridot from Zabargad Island Scheelite under ultraviolet light Willemite under ultraviolet light Second, there are stories about miners finding luminous gems at night and extracting them by day (Ball 1938: 500-501). One notable exception is Pliny's c. 77 CE Natural History that describes finding carbuncles in the daytime, some kinds \\"doe glitter and shine of their owne nature: by reason whereof, they are discovered soone wheresoever they lie, by the reverberation of the Sun-beams\\" (Harvey 1957: 34). In the 1st century BCE, the Greek historians Diodorus Siculus (c. 90-30) and Strabo (c. 63-24) both record the peridot (gem-quality olivine) mine of Egyptian king Ptolemy II Philadelphus (r. 285‚Äì246 BCE) on the barren, forbidden island of Ophiodes (, \\"Snakey\\") or Topazios (, \\"Topaz\\"), modern Zabargad Island, off the ancient Red Sea port Berenice Troglodytica. Diodorus says Philadelphus exterminated the \\"divers sorts of dreadful Serpents\\" that formerly infested on the island on account of the \\"Topaz, a resplendent Stone, of a delightful Aspect, like to Glass, of a Golden colour, and of admirable brightness; and therefore all were forbidden to set footing upon that Place; and if any landed there, he was presently put to death by the Keepers of the Island.\\" The Egyptian mining technique relied upon luminosity. \\"This Stone grows in the Rocks, darken'd by the brightness of the Sun; it's not seen in the Day, but shines bright and glorious in the darkest Night, and discovers itself at a great distance. The Keepers of the Island disperse themselves into several Places to search for this stone, and wherever it appears, they mark the Place, with a great Vessel of largeness sufficient to cover the sparkling Stone; and then in the Day time, go to the Place, and cut out the Stone, and deliver it to those that are Artists in polishing of 'em.\\" (tr. Oldfather et al. 1814 3: 36). According to Strabo, \\"The topaz is a transparent stone sparkling with a golden lustre, which, however, is not easy to be distinguished in the day-time, on account of the brightness of the surrounding light, but at night the stones are visible to those who collect them. The collectors place a vessel over the spot [where the topazes are seen] as a mark, and dig them up in the day.\\" (tr. Hamilton and Falconer 1889 3:103). Ball notes that the legendary \\"topaz\\" of Topazios island is olivine, which is not luminescent while true topaz is, and suggests, \\"This tale may well have been told to travelers by astute Egyptian gem merchants anxious to enhance the value of their wares by exaggerating the dangers inherent to procuring the olivines.\\" (1938: 500). In the present day, the island mine is now submerged underwater and inaccessible. The theme of locating luminous gems at night is found in other sources. The c. 125 CE didactic Christian text Physiologus states that the diamond (\\"carbuncle\\") is not to be found in the day but only at night, which may imply that it emits light (Laufer 1915:62). The Anglo-Indian diplomat Thomas Douglas Forsyth says that in 632, the ancient Iranian Saka Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan sent a \\"splendid jade stone\\" as tribute to Emperor Taizong of Tang. Khotan's rivers were famous for their jade, \\"which was discovered by its shining in the water at night\\", and divers would procure it in shallow waters after the snowmelt floods had subsided (1875: 113). The Bohemian rabbi Petachiah of Regensburg (d. c. 1225) adapted Strabo's story for the gold he saw in the land of Ishmael, east of Nineveh, where \\"the gold grows like herbs. In the night its brightness is seen when a mark is made with dust or lime. They then come in the morning and gather the herbs upon which the gold is found.\\" (tr. Benisch and Ainsworth 1856: 51, 53). A modern parallel to ancient miners seeking luminous gems at nighttime is mineworkers using portable shortwave ultraviolet lamps to locate ores that respond with color-specific fluorescence. For instance, under short-wave UV light, scheelite, a tungsten ore, fluoresces a bright sky-blue, and willemite, a minor ore of zinc, fluoresces green (Ball 1938: 501). =Animal legends= The third luminous-gem theme involves serpents (of Hindu origin), or small animals (Spanish), with gems in their heads, or grateful animals repaying human kindness (Chinese and Roman) (Ball 1938: 501-505). Legends about snakes that carry a marvelous jewel either in their forehead or in their mouth are found almost worldwide. Scholars have suggested that the myth may have originated with snake worship, or light reflected by a serpent's eye, or the flame color of certain snakes' lips. In only a relative few of these legends is the stone luminous, this variant being known in India, Ceylon, ancient Greece, Armenia, and among Cherokee Indians (Ball 1938: 502). The Hindu polymath VarƒÅhamihira's 6th century Brhat Samhit encyclopedic work describes the bright star Canopus, named Agastya (‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø) in Sanskrit, also the name of the rishi Agastya, \\"Its huge white waves looked like clouds; its gems looked like stars; its crystals looked like the Moon; and its long bright serpents bearing gems in their hoods looked like comets and thus the whole sea looked like the sky.\\" Another context says black glossy pearls are also produced in the heads of serpents related to the nƒÅgarƒÅja (‡§®‡§æ‡§ó‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú, \\"dragon kings\\") Takshaka and Vasuki (tr. Iyer 1884: 77, 179). The \\"Snake Jewel\\" story in Somadeva's 11th-century Kathasaritsagara (\\"Ocean of the Streams of Stories\\") refers to a ma·πái (‡§Æ‡§£‡§ø, \\"gem; jewel; pearl\\") on a snake's head. When the Hindu mythological king Nala is fleeing from a jungle wildfire, he hears a voice asking for help and turns back to see a snake \\"having his head encircled with the rays of the jewels of his crest\\", who, after being rescued reveals himself to be the nƒÅgarƒÅja Karkotaka (tr. Tawney 1928 4: 245). The 3rd-century CE Life of Apollonius of Tyana, the Greek sophist Philostratus's biography of Apollonius of Tyana (c. 3 BCE-97 CE), says that in India, people will kill a mountain dragon and cut off its head, in which, \\"are stones of rich lustre, emitting every-coloured rays and of occult virtue.\\" It also mentions a myth that cranes will not build their nests until they have affixed a \\"light-stone\\" (Ancient Greek lychnidis, \\"shining\\") to help the eggs hatch and to drive away snakes (tr. Conybeare 1912: 103, 155). In the Bengali tale of \\"The Rose of Bak√°wal√≠\\", the heroic prince Jamila Khatun encounters a monstrous dragon that carried in its mouth \\"a serpent which emitted a gem so brilliant that it lighted up the jungle for many miles\\". His plan to obtain it was to throw a heavy lump of clay on the luminous gem, plunging the jungle into darkness, \\"so that the dragon and the serpent knocked their heads against the stones and died.\\" (tr. Clouston 1889: 296-297). According to Armenian \\"The Queen of the Serpents\\" legend, the serpents of Mount Ararat select a queen who destroys invading armies of foreign serpents, and carries in her mouth a \\"wonderful stone, the Hul, or stone of light, which upon certain nights she tosses in the air, when it shines as the sun. Happy the man who shall catch the stone ere it falls.\\" (von Haxthausen 1854: 355). Henry Timberlake, the British emissary to the Overhill Cherokee during the 1761-1762 Timberlake Expedition, records a story about medicine men (\\"conjurers\\") using gemstones, which is a variant of the Horned Serpent legend in Iroquois mythology. One luminous gem \\"remarkable for its brilliancy and beauty\\" supposedly \\"grew on the head of a mon Étrous  Éerpent\\" that was guarded by many snakes. The medicine man hid this luminous gemstone, and no one else had seen it. Timberlake supposed he had \\"hatched the account of its difcovery\\" (1765: 48-49). Ball doubts the myth and suggests \\"European influence\\" (1938: 503). The Catalan missionary Jordanus's c. 1330 Mirabilia says he heard that the dragons of India Tertia (Eastern African, south of Abyssinia) have on their heads \\"the lustrous stones which we call carbuncles.\\" When they become too large to fly, they fall and die in a \\"certain river which issues from Paradise\\". After seventy days the people recover the \\"carbuncle which is rooted in the top of his head\\" and take it to Prester John, the Emperor of the Ethiopians (tr. Yule 1863: 42) After his third visit to Persia in 1686, the French jeweler and traveler John Chardin wrote that the Egyptian carbuncle was \\"very probably only an Oriental Ruby of higher Colour than usual.\\" The Persians call it Icheb Chirac, the Flambeau [\\"burning torch\\"] of the Night because of the property and Quality it has of enlightening all things round it\\", and \\"They tell you that the Carbuncle was bred within the Head of a Dragon, a Griffin, or a Royal Eagle, which was found upon the Mountain of Caf.\\" (Chardin 2010: 166-167) Like Chardin's griffin or eagle, some stories about luminous gems involve animals other than snakes and dragons. An early example is the 3rd-century CE Greek Pseudo-Callisthenes Romance of Alexander that says Alexander the Great once speared a fish, \\"in whose bowels was found a white stone so brilliant that everyone believed it was a lamp. Alexander set it in gold, and used it as a lamp at night.\\" (Laufer 1915: 58). Sydney H. Ball recounts the widespread variation of the animal-gratitude snake story involving a wild animal (often called carbuncle, Spanish carbunclo, or Latin carbunculo) with a luminous gem on its head, and which Europeans apparently introduced into Africa and America. In 1565, Don John Bermudez, ambassador of Prester John to John III of Portugal, described an Upper Nile snake called \\"Of the shadow, or Canopie, because it hath a skinne on the head wherewith it covereth a very precious stone, which they say it hath in her head.\\" (Purchas 1625 2: 1169). The English merchant William Finch reported around 1608 a Sierra Leone story about a wolf-like creature with a luminous gem. \\"The Negros told us of a strange beast (which the interpreter called a Carbuncle) oft seene yet only by night, having a stone in his forehead, incredibly shining and giving him light to feed, attentive to the least noyse, which he no sooner heareth, but he presently covereth the same with a filme or skinne given him as a naturall covering that his splendour betray him not.\\" (Dickens 1857: 124). In 1666, another version of the theme is a huge snake recorded from Island Caribs on the island of Dominica, West Indies. \\"On its head was a very sparkling stone, like a Carbuncle, of inestimable price: That it commonly veil'd that rich Jewel with a thin moving skin, like that of a man's eye-lid: but that when it went to drink or sported himself in the midst of that deep bottom, he fully discover'd it, and that the rocks and all about receiv'd a wonderful lustre from the fire issuing out of that precious crown.\\" (de Rochefort 1666: 15). According to the Swiss explorer Johann Jakob von Tschudi, in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia, the native peoples tell stories of a fabulous beast with a luminous gem. \\"The carbunculo is represented to be of the size of a fox, with long black hair, and is only visible at night, when it slinks slowly through the thickets. If followed, he opens a flap or valve in the forehead, from under which an extraordinary, brilliant, and dazzling light issues. The natives believe that this light proceeds from a brilliant precious stone, and that any fool hardy person who may venture to grasp at it rashly is blinded; then the flap is let down, and the animal disappears in the darkness.\\" (von Tschudi 1854: 320). The American archeologist Adolph Francis Alphonse Bandelier cites von Tschudi and describes the carbunculo as a cat with a blood-red jewel, which is supposed to dwell on Nevado Sajama mountain, near Oruro, Bolivia. Bandelier believes his Bolivian informants that the carbunculo has existed from the earliest times, and \\"certainly before the conquest, so that its introduction cannot be attributed to the Spaniards\\" (1910: 320). Nevertheless, based upon how closely the above American versions of the myth follow the pattern of the European form, Ball concludes that the Spaniards introduced the carbuncle myth (1938: 504). In contrast to the above legends about people killing snakes and animals in order to obtain their luminous gems, another group of legends has a theme of injured animals presenting magical gems out of gratitude to people who helped them. This is a subcategory of The Grateful Animals folktale motif (Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification systems 554), for example, The White Snake or The Queen Bee. These animal-gratitude stories are first recorded around two millennia ago in China and Rome. Based upon striking coincidences in Chinese and Roman versions of the story, Laufer reasoned that there was an obvious historical connection (1915: 59-60), and Ball believes these tales probably originated independently (1938: 504). Bi jade-disk with a dual dragon motif, Warring States period The earliest known story about a grateful animal with a luminous gem is the Chinese Suihouzhu (Èö®‰æØÁè†, \\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\\") legend that a year after he saved the life of a wounded snake, it returned and gave him a fabulous pearl that emitted a light as bright as that of the moon (Ball 1938: 504). Sui (Èö®, cf. Èöã Sui dynasty), located in present-day Suizhou, Hubei, was a lesser feudal state during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046 BC‚Äì256 BCE) and a vassal state of Chu. Several Warring States period (c. 475-221 BCE) texts mention Marquis Sui's pearl as a metaphor for something important or valuable, but without explaining the grateful snake tale, which implies that it was common knowledge among contemporary readers. The Marquis of Sui's pearl is mentioned in the Zhanguo ci (\\"Strategies of the Warring States\\") compendium of political and military anecdotes dating from 490 to 221 BCE. King Wuling of Zhao (r. 325‚Äì299 BCE) summoned Zheng Tong (ÈÑ≠Âêå) for an audience and asked how to avoid warfare with neighboring feudal states. Zheng Tong replied, 'Well, let us suppose there is a man who carries with him the pearl of Sui-hou and the Ch'ih-ch'iu armband [ÊåÅ‰∏ò‰πãÁí∞, uncertain] as well as goods valued at ten thousand in gold. Now he stops the night in an uninhabited place.\\" Since he has neither weapons nor protectors, \\"It is clear he will not spend more than a night abroad before someone harms him. At the moment there are powerful and greedy states on your majesty's borders and they covet your land. ‚Ä¶ If you lack weapons your neighbours, of course, will be quite satisfied.\\" (tr. Crump 1970: 327). The c. 3rd-1st centuries BCE Daoist Zhuangzi (book) alludes to the marquis's pearl. \\"Whenever the sage makes a movement, he is certain to examine what his purpose is and what he is doing. If now, however, we suppose that there were a man who shot at a sparrow a thousand yards away with the pearl of the Marquis of Sui, the world would certainly laugh at him. Why is this? It is because what he uses is important and what he wants is insignificant. And is not life much more important than the pearl of the Marquis of Sui?\\" (tr. Mair 1994: 288). Several Chinese classics pair the legendary Suihouzhu (\\"the Marquis of Sui's pearl\\") with another priceless gem, the Heshibi (ÂíåÊ∞èÁíß, \\"Mr. He's jade\\"). The bi is a type of circular Chinese jade artifact, and \\"Mr. He\\" was Bian He (ÂçûÂíå), who found a marvelous piece of raw jade that went cruelly unrecognized by successive Chu monarchs until it was finally acknowledged as a priceless jewel. The c. 3rd-1st century BCE Chuci (\\"Songs of Chu\\") mentions the paired gems, \\"Shards and stones are prized as jewels / Sui and He rejected\\". This poetic anthology also says, \\"It grieves me that shining pearls [ÊòéÁè†] should be cast out in the mire / While worthless fish-eye stones are treasured in a strong-box\\", and describes a flying chariot, \\"Fringed with the dusky Moon Bright pearls [ÊòéÊúà‰πãÁéÑÁè†]\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985: 277, 295, 290). King Liu An's c. 139 BCE Huainanzi (\\"Philosophers of Huainan\\") uses the story to describe one who has attained the Way of Heaven (Â§©ÈÅì), \\"It is like the pearl of Marquis Sui or the jade disk of Mr. He. Those who achieved it became rich; those who lost it became poor.\\" (tr. Major et al. 2010: 218). The c. 222 CE De Natura Animalium (\\"On the Characteristics of Animals\\"), compiled by Roman author Claudius Aelianus, told the story of Heraclea or Herakleis, a virtuous widow of Tarentum, who after seeing a fledgling stork fall and break its leg, nursed it back to health, and set it free. One year later, as Heraclea sat at the door of her cottage, the young stork returned and dropped a precious stone into her lap, and she put it indoors. Awakening that night, she saw that the gem \\"diffused a brightness and a gleam, and the house was lit up as though a torch had been brought in, so strong a radiance came from, and was engendered by, the lump of stone.\\" (tr. Scholfield 1959: 209-210). Laufer cites three c. 4th- century Chinese grateful-animal stories that parallel Heraclea's stork. The Shiyi ji (\\"Researches into Lost Records\\"), compiled by the Daoist scholar Wang Jia (d. 390 CE) from early apocryphal versions of Chinese history, recounts an anecdote about King Zhao of Yan (ÁáïÊò≠Áéã, r. 311‚Äì279 BCE) and grateful birds with dongguangzhu (Ê¥ûÂÖâÁè†, \\"cave shining pearls\\"). > When Prince Chao of Yen was once seated on a terrace, black birds with white > heads flocked there together, holding in their beaks perfectly resplendent > pearls, measuring one foot all round. These pearls were black as lacquer, > and emitted light in the interior of a house to such a degree that even the > spirits could not obscure their supernatural essence.\\" (tr. Laufer 1915: > 59). The imperial historian Gan Bao's c. 350 CE Soushen Ji (\\"In Search of the Supernatural\\") has two grateful-animal stories involving luminous pearls/gems. The first involves a black crane; according to legend, when a crane has lived a thousand years it turns blue; after another thousand it becomes black and is called a xuanhe (ÁéÑÈ∂¥. \\"dark crane\\"). > Kuai Shen [Âô≤ÂèÉ] was the most filial son to his mother. Once a black crane was > injured by a bow hunter and in its extremity, went to Kuai. The latter took > it in, doctored its wound, and when it was cured set it free. Soon > afterwards the crane showed up again outside Kuai's door. The latter shone a > torch to see out and discovered its mate there too. Each of them held a > single night-glowing pearl [ÊòéÁè†] in its beak to repay Kuai. (tr. DeWoskin and > Crump 1996: 238). The second story is oldest detailed explanation of Marquis of Sui's pearl. > Once upon a time, when the ruler of the old Sui kingdom was journeying, he > came upon a great wounded serpent whose back was broken. The ruler believed > the creature to be a spirit manifestation and ordered his physician to treat > it with drugs to close up its wound. Thereafter the serpent was able to move > again, and the place was called Mound of the Wounded Serpent. One year later > the serpent brought a bright pearl [ÊòéÁè†] in its mouth to give the ruler of > Sui to show its gratitude. The pearl was greater than an inch in diameter, > of the purest white and emitted light like moonglow. In the dark it could > illuminate an entire room. For these reasons it was known as \\"Duke Sui's > Pearl\\" [Èöã‰æØÁè†] or the \\"Spirit Snake's Pearl\\" [ÈùàËõáÁè†], or, again, the \\"Moonlight > Pearl\\" [ÊòéÊúàÁè†]. (tr. DeWoskin and Crump 1996: 239). Laufer concludes that the \\"coincidences in these three Chinese versions and the story of the Greek author, even in unimportant details such as the thankful bird returning after one year to the marquis of Sui, are so striking, that an historical connection between the two is obvious.\\" (1915: 60). A later elaboration of animal-gratitude stories involves grateful animals and ungrateful people, who are typically rescued from a pitfall trap (Ashliman 2010). Two versions mention marvelous gems. The English historian Matthew Paris's c. 1195 Chronicles says that Richard I of England (1157-1199) used to tell a parable about ungrateful people. A Venetian, Vitalis, was rescued from a horrible death by a ladder being let down into a pit into which he had fallen. A lion and a serpent trapped in the same pit used his ladder to escape, and the lion in gratitude brought to Vitalis a goat he had killed and the snake a luminous jewel that he carried in his mouth. As Richard reportedly told the story after his return from the Crusades he may have heard it in the East, as similar stories, but without the stone being luminous, occur in two Indian collections, the c. 300 BCE Kalila wa Dimnah and the 11th-century Kathasaritsagara (Ball 1938: 505). The English poet John Gower's 1390 Confessio Amantis tells the story of the rich Roman lord Adrian and the poor woodcutter Bardus. Adrian falls into a pit that had already captured an ape and a serpent, and promises to give half his wealth to Bardus for pulling him out. After Bardus rescues the three, out of gratitude the ape piled up firewood for him and the serpent gave him \\"a stone more bright than cristall out of his mouth\\", but Adrian refuses to pay his debt. Bardus sells the luminous gem for gold and afterwards found it again in his purse, and the same thing happened every time he sold it. Emperor Justinian I summons Bardus, listens to his testimony supported by the magically reappearing gem, and compels Adrian to fulfill his promise (tr. Clouston 1887 1: 224-226). Some scholars were skeptical about luminous gem stories. In the West, the earliest nonbeliever was the Portuguese traveler to India and gem expert, Garcia de Orta (1563), who, having been told by a jeweler of a luminous carbuncle, doubted its existence. In the East, the first recorded skeptic was the Chinese encyclopedist Song Yingxing, who in 1628 wrote \\"it is not true that there are pearls emitting light at the hour of the dusk or night.\\" (Ball 1938: 505).

Known mostly for her appearances on stage, she also performed in radio theatre and appeared in several films. Her career spanned nearly forty years. Early life and education Meta Luts was born in the rural municipality of Riidaja in Valga County to parents Andres and Juuli Mari Luts (n√©e Gentalen). She had two older sisters, Lonny and Karin, and a younger brother named Elmar. Karin would go on to become a successful painter and graphic artist. Her first couisn was artist Julius Gentalen.

LISD is affiliated with the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. Founded in 2000 by the Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, the Institute aims to enhance global peace and stability through its projects, publications, and commentaries. The overarching principles of LISD are outlined in the Liechtenstein Draft Convention on Self-Determination Through Self-Administration (2002), which was drafted by Hans-Adam II and Sir Arthur Watts. The manuscript outlines the general principle of self-determination as detailed by the United Nations General Assembly. It addresses, not only the set of proposals and technical requirements for the so-called Liechtenstein Initiative, but it also considers the structure of a treaty as a legal instrument for future cases. History In 2000, Prince Hans Adam II (born 1945) established a fund for the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination, which was based at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. The $12 million gift provides funding, support, and space for faculty, students, and policymakers to engage in research on self-determination. Founding Director Wolfgang Danspeckgruber remarked that LISD aims to \\"reduce the tumultuous and frequently violent process inherent in the search for increased autonomy.‚Äù The early projects at LISD included one on state power, borders, and self-governance in the former Soviet Union, and another that sought to analyze tensions among separatist groups in Kashmir. Since then, LISD has broadened in scope to include projects in a wide variety of geographic regions. More recent projects include LISD's focus on conflicts in the Balkan region, especially in states such as Macedonia, Kosovo, and Montenegro. There has also been interest in researching aspects of Tibetan self-determination in partnership with the Association for Asian Studies. Academics =Organization= As of the 2018-2019 academic year, LISD has 39 faculty associates and 20 non-resident Fellows. The members of the executive committee include Cecilia Rouse, Dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs; Mark R. Beissinger, Henry W. Putnam Professor of Politics; and Amaney Jamal, Edwards S. Sanford Professor of Politics. Members of the Executive Committee include Prince Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein; Hereditary Prince Alois of Liechtenstein; and Ursula Plassnik, Ambassador of the Republic of Austria to the Swiss Confederation. In addition to the executive committee, the advisory council also allows input from scholars at other universities and research institutes to lead new projects. Members of the advisory council include Ali Ansari, Professor of Iranian History at the University of St. Andrews, and William A. Maley, Professor of Asia-Pacific College of Diplomacy at the Australian National University. =Courses= The Institute organizes a number of courses at Princeton University, including \\"Theory and Practice of International Diplomacy\\" and \\"Topics in International Relations: International Crisis Diplomacy\\". These courses aim to provide undergraduate and graduate students with foundational knowledge about the causes and implications of geopolitical conflicts and crises. In October 2018, LISD co-sponsored a new online edX course with Tel Aviv University entitled \\"HOPE: Human Odyssey to Political Existentialism\\". The course explores various themes that define humanity. Outside of coursework, students are able take part in various initiatives such as the Emerging Foreign and Security Dimensions (EFSD) Fellowship or the Program on Religion, Diplomacy, and International Relations (PORDIR).

Plot As described in a film magazine, Anne Wilmot (Stewart) and her aunt Katherine (Farrington) leave Fifth Avenue to go to Arizona and spend a month at her fiance Leon Morse's (Hull) lodge in the mountains near an immense hydroelectric engineering project. Leon is determined to obtain a right-of-way across the site occupied by the dam for his railroad, but Bill Shannon (Hearn), the builder, has other views about it. Anne meets Bill when he rescues her from a perilous position on a rock endangered by the rising waters of a stream. Sheb (Whitman), his right hand man, warns Bill against all women, but he gives Anne some food when she pleads hunger and then makes her wash the dishes. Charles Burkthaler (Sprotte), hired by Leon to destroy the dam, places his men at crucial points. Anne notifies Bill of their scheme and cuts the wire to prevent them from blowing up the dam. A tunnel, however, is destroyed, and Anne is caught under the debris. Sheb finds her and takes her to Bill's cabin.

The parish was founded by Lithuanian immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. Begun in 1912, the current church building realized its current form in 1927. History Lithuanians began settling in the Hartford, Connecticut area in the 1890s. By 1894, Father Joseph Zebris, who had been celebrating Mass in Waterbury, Connecticut, began his mission in Hartford, where a nucleus of 20 Lithuanian families was established. His endeavor was to unify the Lithuanian families, and did so by organizing \\"The Sons of Lithuania Society\\" in Hartford in 1896, under the patronage of St. John the Baptist. In June 1898, Father Zebris was appointed as pastor of a church in New Britain. This, however, did not diminish his fervor of Hartford's Lithuanian Catholics' ability to celebrate Mass in their native tongue. During the latter half of the 19th century, many Lithuanians immigrated to foreign countries, most choosing the eastern part of the United States, where a better-developed industry offered more jobs and better wages. About 80 immigrants settled in Hartford. Father Zebris organized a meeting for all Lithuanian Hartfordites and those from Windsor and Poquonock to discuss offering Mass on Sundays in Hartford. The faithful and ardent immigrants held a July 4th bazaar/picnic, and from the proceeds were able to rent a large room in a building on the corner of Sheldon and Main Street for $12 a month. They celebrated their first Mass there on July 17, 1898.Wolkovich-Valkaviƒçius, William. Lithuanian Religious Life in America: a Compendium of 150 Roman Catholic Parishes and Institutions. Norwood, MA: Corporate Fulfillment Systems, 1991-98. By the year 1900, the Hartford Lithuanian mission had grown immensely, and Pastor J. Zebris addressed the diocese, that it recognize the Hartford Lithuanian Catholic community as its own entity. Therefore, this year is considered as the beginning date for the establishment of the Hartford Lithuanian Catholic church. Through the efforts of Reverend Zebris, property was acquired on June 22, 1903, consisting of a lot and a two-story brick building on 41 Capitol Avenue, with a loan for $10,000. The parishioners renovated a part of this building to be used as a church, which on August 18, 1903, was consecrated and named \\"The Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Redeemer\\". A celebration followed with a parade, orchestra, and priests from various Lithuanian parishes, as well as organizations, i.e.\\"The Lithuanian Roman Catholic Sons Society\\" and \\"The Knights of Lithuania, Chapter 6\\". At the ceremony, Vicar General Reverend John Synott and Pastor Zebris of Waterbury, and other Lithuanian priests, including Joseph Jakstys (St. Casimer Parish, Worcester, MA), Anthony Milukas (Zvaigsdute publisher), Peter Saurusaitis and John Ambot (St. Joseph Polish Parish, Norwich, Connecticut) were present. Although the parishioners' material possessions were lean, their conviction to keep the church viable was strong. This goal was aided by more Lithuanians settling in Hartford and in the year 1912, the loan of $10,000, was paid off.  First pastor  From 1903, Father Zebris had dual pastor duties at the New Britain and Hartford Lithuanian Churches. In New Britain the ongoing construction of a Lithuanian church needed funds and Father Zebris, it was alleged, started borrowing unauthorized monies from Hartford's Holy Trinity Church. As a necessity, Father Zebris withdrew from Holy Trinity Church affairs in June 1912 and was transferred by Bishop John J. Nilan, to assume the duties of pastor at St. Joseph Polish Church, Norwich. Also in June 1912, Bishop Nilan appointed a Lithuanian Pastor, the Reverend John J. Ambot, to Holy Trinity Church in Hartford. Energetic and dedicated, Father Ambot worked for the parish and for the welfare of the Lithuanian community. The church flourished in attendance, and various Catholic Lithuanian societies were established. Father Zebris later died on February 8, 1915, but he had paid most of the money back to Holy Trinity Church. Father Ambot was approached with a plan ‚Äì to join together the New Britain and Hartford churches. He declined. All along, Father Ambot wished to build a cohesive church in Hartford. Because the present church could not accommodate the influx of Hartford's Lithuanian Catholics, Father Ambot had to expand the chapel. Since the lot for the church was very small, first the existing chapel (the old building) was moved to the area behind the space for the new church building. Two horses were used to move the two-story building over six months in 1913 about . Construction was underway. The cornerstone of the new church was blessed in the summer of 1915. The high ceilinged basement and the engaging facade of the future church were completed by Christmas of the same year. The price was 30,000. dollars. For 51 years, Father Ambot worked diligently and vibrantly as provost of Holy Trinity Church. Due to his capability, devotion, unending activity and understanding the needs of an ethnic church, this was a big stimulus to the parish. Holy Trinity began to flourish, as it moved forward. Hartford Holy Trinity Church First Stage Building 1915 In 1916, the lot adjacent to the church property, 53 Capitol Avenue, was purchased for $20,000. by the parish. This parcel of land contained two buildings - one was a brick structure, the other wooden. The brick home was used as the rectory. The wooden house was initially a residence for the organist and later as a place for Franciscan monks to live. Then in 1924, this building became a convent for the teachers of the parish school. In 1925, it was decided by parishioners that a complete renovation of the church was needed, so that it would be uniform, not built at different times or added on. Costing slightly more than $100,000, the result was the church as we know it today. Two tall towers would grace the front of the church, one tower would hold 3 gold embossed bells. The inside of the church would house three altars with gold gilding, a large pipe organ, oak pews, and colorful statues as well as stained windows. This work was completed in March 1927 and on March 18, 1928, it was dedicated. For unknown reasons the previous parish name did not survive, and the church was renamed Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe, on April 18, 1939, gave John J. Ambot, the title of Monsignor. Until his death on December 19, 1963, at the age of 93, Monsignor Ambot, was an experienced, beloved leader that by example, led the parishioners to work in unity, devoting their time to their church and cognizant of the spiritual value it presented to their lives.  The school  Hartford Holy Trinity School 1930 In 1923, Hartford's Holy Trinity Parish acquired a three-story, 18-room building at 339 Capitol Avenue (formerly the St. Joseph Cathedral School) for $50,000. There was unanimous agreement that it was necessary to educate future generations with a firm religious, cultural and ethnic background. The two lower floors of the building were used for classrooms and the third floor was remodeled with an auditorium complete with a stage for concerts, plays, and other educational and cultural events. The school was staffed by Lithuanian Franciscan Sisters from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, (who had been established the previous year). In 1924, Holy Trinity School started to accept students. In that year, there were 164 students in the elementary classes. Six Sisters were designated to teach under the direction of Mother M. Battista. The school evolved to include secondary grades of education (high school). Holy Trinity School was the first Catholic School in the Hartford Diocese. Its good ranking attracted one of Governor John Dempsey's sons. In 1964, the diocese ordered the school to be closed. The Hartford Diocese, in the meantime, built three new Catholic schools. The diocese sold the building, that was the Holy Trinity Catholic School, and the new owners demolished the building and built a gas station. During the forty years this school educated, provided religious guidance, and taught exemplary life skills to more than 6,000 students.  Invigorated parishioners  Many of the early Lithuanian immigrants were strong, energetic, and productive. The parish community of Hartford had grown to over 500 families, however, by the mid-twentieth century, the movement to the expanding suburbs and time had taken a toll on this aging colony. Shortly after the war (around 1949‚Äì1950) an influx of about 300 displaced Lithuanian persons began to arrive in the Hartford area. The ranks of Holy Trinity Church were revitalized by drawing these devout Catholics to worship and socialize. During this time, many Lithuanian cultural, ethnic, and social organizations were formed. They were/are as follows: Lithuanian Scouts (1949), Lithuanian Leadership Committee (Bendruomene), BALFAS (1948), Veterans' Society (1953), choir \\"Aidas\\" (1964), Koffee Klub (1967), Lithuanian Dance Group, Lithuanian Saturday School, Lithuanian Women's Federation Club, Men's Trio, etc. This growth of Lithuanian friendship, worship, and activity spanned around sixty years. On February 13, 1964, Father Joseph Matutis was appointed as Pastor of Holy Trinity Church. In 1964 he implemented Vatican council rules for Catholic churches. Father Matutis also saw the need for church renovations. In 1975 the church proper and the basement were totally remodeled. He also, despite the deterioration of the surrounding neighborhoods, he was able to keep the parishioner population from declining because he was social by nature, and became an accessible friend to many parishioners. In 1975 there were 300 families in the parish. A lot of attention was paid to the Catholic holy days and ethnic holidays in his sermons. During Father Matutis's tenure, there was an era of burgeoning growth of the suburbs and many Lithuanian families left Hartford to live in these areas. However, their loyalty to their ethnic church did not diminish, and there was little decrease in Mass attendance. In 1975 Father Matutis requested and was granted the services of Priest Albin J. Gurklis. He was a teacher of mathematics at Marianopolis High School in Thompson, Connecticut. The dedicated Father Gurklis traveled 50 miles every weekend for 33 years, no matter what the weather, to celebrate Mass at Holy Trinity. In the decade of the 1980s, Father Matutis took part in celebrating two of the Lithuanian Catholic church's jubilees. On March 4, 1984, St. Casimer's 500-year jubilee was celebrated. On May 17, 1987, the 600th anniversary of Lithuanian Catholicism and the wayside cross, erected at Hartford's St. Joseph Cathedral was dedicated. During the dedication of this cross, Archbishop John Whealon celebrated a Mass for the Hartford parishioners. Joseph Matitus retired on October 16, 1990, and died October 22, 1999. In 1990 Father John Moskus was appointed to succeed Father Matutis as pastor of Holy Trinity Church. Father Moskus was also of Lithuanian descent. While Father Moskus was the pastor of Holy Trinity Church, the church basement and rectory underwent renovation. He also renewed the traditional annual Parish May festival. In 1990 Lithuania gained its independence from the Soviet Union, which brought a new wave of parishioners to Holy Trinity. On October 14, 1990, the Hartford Archdiocese, led by Archbishop John F. Whealon, and Lithuanian Bishop Paulius Baltakis along with many other bishops and priests, celebrated the Mass as a \\"Prayer Day for Lithuania\\". In remembrance of the 1941 mass Lithuanian deportation to Siberia by the Soviets, a wooden wayside cross was erected in the front yard of the rectory in June 1992. In 1996 Father Christopher Tiano was appointed an administrator of Holy Trinity Church. This was in addition to his duties as chief editor of \\"The Catholic Transcript\\". Sometime after his appointment Masses began to be said in English as well as Lithuanian, with the Sunday morning Mass being the only one spoken completely in Lithuanian by Father Gurklis. Under Father Tiano, in 1997 Sister Mary Louise Rouleau, CSJ, began assisting in the day to day proceedings of Holy Trinity Church as the Pastoral Associate. One of her first actions was to create a prayer discussion group. In 1999 the parish administrative duties were taken over by Father John P. Conte. He was also an advisor to the Hartford diocese. On December 16, 2000, Pope John Paul II, in recognition of Father Conte's achievements, bestowed the honorary title of Abbot upon him. On June 1, 2001, Father Charles E. Jacobs was appointed an administrator of Holy Trinity Church. Although the registry of first and second-generation Lithuanians has dwindled, Holy Trinity Church more recently has become a more diverse and robust congregation, due to the outreach efforts of Father Jacobs, who embraces all who attend.

Beck does not know it yet, but she is perfect for him, and soon she cannot resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom made for her.

Shyamala; April 7, 1938 ‚Äì February 11, 2009) was an Indian American biomedical scientist, born in British India, whose work in isolating and characterizing the progesterone receptor gene stimulated advances in breast biology and oncology. She was the mother of Kamala Harris, a U.S. senator and the Democratic vice presidential nominee for the 2020 election; and Maya Harris, a lawyer and political commentator.  Early life and education  Shyamala was the daughter of an Indian civil servant, P. V. Gopalan and his wife, Rajam. Gopalan had begun his professional life as a stenographer and as he rose through the ranks of the civil service, he moved the family every few years between Madras (now Chennai), New Delhi, Bombay (now Mumbai), and Calcutta (now Kolkata). According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"Gopalan was a Brahmin, part of a privileged elite in Hinduism‚Äôs ancient caste hierarchy.\\". He and Rajam were both from Tamil Nadu state, and had married in an arranged marriage; however, according to Shyamala's brother, Balachandran, in raising the children, their parents had been broad-minded, and all of the children were to lead somewhat unconventional lives. A gifted singer of South Indian classical music, Shyamala won a national competition in it as a teenager. Shyamala studied for a BSc in Home Science at Lady Irwin College in New Delhi, a leading women's college in India. Her father thought the subject‚Äîwhich taught skills considered to be helpful in homemaking‚Äîwas a mismatch for her abilities; her mother expected the children to seek careers in medicine, engineering, or the law. In 1958, aged 19, Shyamala unexpectedly applied to a masters program in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley and was accepted. Her parents used some of their retirement savings to pay for her tuition and board during the first year. Not having a phone line in their home, they communicated with her after her arrival in the US by writing aerogrammes. She eventually earned a PhD in nutrition and endocrinology at UC Berkeley in 1964. Shyamala's dissertation was titled The isolation and purification of a trypsin inhibitor from whole wheat flour. Note: last name and first name are listed swapped.  Career  Shyamala conducted research in UC Berkeley's Department of Zoology and Cancer Research Lab. She worked as a breast cancer researcher at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of Wisconsin. She worked for 16 years at Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research and McGill University Faculty of Medicine. She served as a peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health and as a site visit team member for the Federal Advisory Committee. She also served on the President's Special Commission on Breast Cancer. She mentored dozens of students in her lab. For her last decade of research, Shyamala worked in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. = Research = Shyamala's research led to advancements in the knowledge of hormones pertaining to breast cancer. Her work in the isolation and characterization of the progesterone receptor gene in mice changed research on the hormone-responsiveness of breast tissue.  Personal life  In the fall of 1962, at a meeting of the Afro American Association‚Äîa students' group at Berkeley whose members would go on to give structure to the discipline of Black studies, propose the holiday of Kwanzaa, and help establish the Black Panther Party‚ÄîShyamala met a graduate student in economics from Jamaica, Donald J. Harris, who was that day's speaker. According to Donald Harris, who is now an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University, ‚ÄúWe talked then, continued to talk at a subsequent meeting, and at another, and another.\\" In 1963 they were married without following conventions of introducing Harris to Shyamala's parents beforehand or having the ceremony in her hometown in India. In the later 1960s, Donald and Shyamala took their daughters, Kamala, then four or five years old, and Maya, two years younger, to newly independent Zambia, where Shyamala's father, Gopalan, was on an advisory assignment. After Shyamala had divorced Donald in the early 1970s, she took her daughters several times to India to visit her parents in Chennai to which they had retired. The children also visited their father's family in Jamaica as they grew up. Death Shyamala died of colon cancer in Oakland on 11 February 2009. In lieu of flowers, she requested that donations be made to the organization Breast Cancer Action. Later in 2009, her daughter Kamala Harris carried her ashes to Chennai on the southeastern coast of peninsular India and scattered them in the Indian Ocean waters.

The shopping center is now considered a dead mall, after issues related to a landfill underlying the site began to affect the structural integrity of some buildings.

The first store to close was Jo-Ann Fabrics on January 15, 2008. On September 15, 2008, Walmart Stores Inc. announced that it would be closing the Garfield Heights Wal-Mart store permanently because of ongoing safety concerns at the site, including structural problems and potentially explosive methane gas related to the disused landfill beneath the site. After Walmart's closure, on October 2, 2008, Petsmart announced that they would be also closing their store. Shortly after, the Circuit City store closed on December 31, 2008. In December 2009, both Bed Bath And Beyond and Dicks Sporting Goods closed. In March 2010, plans to convert the former Wal-Mart into a convention center were cancelled. Marshalls closed in 2013.

Founded in 1763, after the repeal of the British penal laws, as the first Catholic church in Frederick County, the parish occupied two former buildings before the completion of the present Greek Revival church in 1837. At the time of its opening, the church was the largest parish church in the United States and was the first Catholic church to be consecrated in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Today, the church remains the tallest building in the city of Frederick.  History  St. John's Church The first Catholic church in Frederick County, Maryland was established in 1763, in a brick house on the north side of Second Street. Though Catholics had been present in the Province of Maryland from its establishment in 1634 by the Lord Baltimore, Cecil Calvert, the British penal laws forbade the open practice of Catholicism. The Jesuits administered the parish until their suppression by the pope in 1773; their involvement in the parish was resumed in 1814. Following the repeal of the Penal Laws in 1776, Pope Pius VI established the Diocese of Baltimore, in whose territory the church laid. Under the pastorate of Rev. John DuBois, construction on a new building for St. John's Church began, and the cornerstone was laid on May 15, 1800. (This cornerstone was rediscovered in 1904, and sits at the entrance of the church today). DuBois' successor, Rev. John McElroy, S.J. decided to demolish this building and erect a new church. Construction began in 1833, and the completed church was consecrated on April 26, 1837, becoming the first consecrated church in the Archdiocese of Baltimore and the largest parish church in the United States. During the Civil War, the church was converted in its purpose as a jail for captured Confederate soldiers. Jesuit involvement in the church came to an end in 1902, after their novitiate located across the street from St. John's relocated to New York. The church is located at the intersection of Second Street and Chapel Alley in the Frederick Historic District. It is adjacent to the Visitation Academy of Frederick. It operates the nearby St. John's Cemetery, which was founded in 1845.  Architecture  Exterior photographed in 1933 The existing church building, completed in 1837, is built in the Greek Revival style. Designed by local architect John Tien, the building's fa√ßade features pilasters of the Ionic order. The cruciform floor plan takes the shape of a Latin cross, extending in length and in width. The pediment of the fa√ßade contains an relief of St. John the Evangelist with his attribute, an eagle, to his left and to his right an angel holding a tablet inscribed with \\"\\" and \\"\\", meaning \\"in the beginning was the Word...and the Word became flesh.\\" The church's square bell tower was completed in 1857, consisting of three, one-story telescoping sections and being topped by a gold cupola and a finial cross. Rising , it makes St. John the Evangelist the tallest building in the city of Frederick. = Interior = In 1912, in celebration of the church's 75th anniversary of its consecration, a painting of the Ascension of Jesus was commissioned by Severino Baraldi in the center of the ceiling. Prior to its painting, the area was occupied by an IHS Christogram, surrounded by six cherubim. The church is also adorned with a painting of the Crucifixion by Pietro Gagliardi, which was added in 1843. The church's high altar is constructed of Egyptian and Italian marble, while each window is peaked with a bust of St. John the Evangelist. In 1845, the Stations of the Cross were donated by Bishop Andrew Byrne of Little Rock to Rev. McElroy.

Early life and education Marian Boykan was born in 1928 in New York City; her parents were dentist Joseph Boykan and his wife Matilda (Mattie, n√©e Caspe), a former laboratory technician and housewife. As a young girl, she performed ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House, and this influenced her later life where she was often more comfortable speaking before large audiences than in small groups. Although she wanted to attend the Bronx High School of Science, it was at that time only for boys; instead, she went to a girls' school, Hunter College High School. Her parents were unwilling to pay the tuition for private college for her, so she went to Hunter College, an inexpensive local school primarily aimed at training schoolteachers. There she earned a bachelor's degree in physics in 1949. She also completed enough courses in mathematics for a second major but was not allowed to have two majors by Hunter College's rules. She was accepted to Harvard University for graduate studies in mathematics, with full support, as the only woman in the program. At Harvard, she earned a master's degree in 1951 and a Ph.D. in mathematical logic in 1958. She was very isolated and lonely at Harvard, with few friends and, initially, no other students even willing to sit next to her in her classes. The nearest restroom to her classes was in a different building, and one of the few buildings with air conditioning in the summers was off-limits to women, even when she was assigned as an instructor to a class in that building. Because there were no logicians at Harvard at that time, she spent five years of her time as a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley. Her doctoral dissertation was Computable Functions. Career After finishing her doctorate, Pour-El joined the mathematics faculty at Pennsylvania State University. She earned her tenure there in 1962. During a sabbatical from 1962 to 1964 at the Institute for Advanced Study, she worked with Kurt G√∂del. She moved in 1964 to the University of Minnesota, and was promoted to full professor there in 1968. Except for a year from 1969 to 1970 as a visiting professor at the University of Bristol, she remained at the University of Minnesota until her retirement in 2000. At Minnesota, her doctoral students included Jill Zimmerman (Ph.D. 1990), later the James M. Beall Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at Goucher College. Contributions Pour-El's early work concerned recursion theory, and included joint work with William Alvin Howard, Saul Kripke, Donald A. Martin, and Hilary Putnam. In a 1974 publication, she studied analogues of computability for analog computers. She proved that, for her formulation of this problem, the functions that can be computed by such computers are the same as the functions that define solutions to algebraic differential equations. This result, a refinement of the work of Claude Shannon, became known as the Shannon‚ÄìPour-El thesis. In the late 1970s Pour-El began working on computable analysis. Her \\"most famous and surprising result\\", co-authored with Minnesota colleague J. Ian Richards, was that for certain computable initial conditions, determining the behavior of the wave equation is an undecidable problem. Their result was later taken up by Roger Penrose in his book The Emperor's New Mind; Penrose used this result as a test case for the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis, but concluded that the non-smoothness of the initial conditions makes it implausible that a computational device could use this phenomenon to exceed the limits of conventional computing. Freeman Dyson used the same result to argue for the evolutionary superiority of analog to digital forms of life. With Richards, Pour-El was the author of a book, Computability in Analysis and Physics. Recognition Pour-El was elected to the Hunter College Hall of Fame in 1975, and as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1983. A symposium was held in honor of Pour-El in Japan in 1993. Personal life As a student at Berkeley, Pour-El met her husband, Israeli biochemist Akiva Pour-El. They had one daughter, Ina. Her husband followed her to Penn State after completing his doctorate a year later, and he later followed her, again, when she moved to Minnesota. They lived separately for several long intervals, most notably from 1969 to 1975 when her husband taught in Illinois, and Pour-El wrote an article in 1981 on how having a long-distance relationship worked for her. Pour-El's brother is music composer Martin Boykan.

Most of the contributing properties in the district were built between 1880 and 1949, including large, stylish homes built by businessmen and professionals, and smaller vernacular homes built by laborers. The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 for its concentration of intact historical architecture. With Marshfield began in 1872 when the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its main line just a hundred yards north of the forest that would become the Pleasant Hill neighborhood. Hotels and saloons opened for the railroad workers and lumberjacks, then hardware stores and harness shops. A sawmill opened, a furniture factory, a feed mill, and a stave and heading factory. Doctors and lawyers set up practices. The rough little community among the stumps grew rapidly, with a population of 2,090 by 1885. But don't picture the orderly Central Avenue of today; instead picture horses pulling clanking wagons past drunken lumberjacks stumbling to the next saloon, churning the unpaved Central Avenue into mud, dust, or slush. The earliest large, stylish houses in Marshfield were built starting in 1880 by the officers of the Upham Company, west of Central near their sawmill in what is now the Upham House Historic District. Not long after, other businessmen and professionals began building large, stylish houses a few blocks east of Central on what was probably already called Pleasant Hill. It wasn't much of a hill, but it was higher than Central Avenue, and it must have seemed pleasant compared to the dirt and noise on Central. 107 S. Cherry, built 1880, at right, with the railroad at left The Pleasant Hill neighborhood contains no Italianate-styled buildings. Two houses of that style are in the older Upham House district on the other side of Central Avenue. This is because the two Italianate Upham houses were built in 1880 and 1882, while the earliest surviving stylish house in Pleasant Hill was built after Italianate homes largely went out of fashion around 1885. Styles continued to change over the years. Here is a selection of houses in Pleasant Hill representing various styles, in the order built: * The house at 107 S. Cherry Avenue is a simple 2-story front-gabled house. Built in 1880 and added to in 1885, it is probably the oldest remaining house in the district, built near the rail line that was laid only eight years before. William Noll, Jr., house, Queen Anne, 1891 * The William Noll, Jr. house at 117 South Cherry is a large Queen Anne-style house built in 1891, 2.5 stories with hip and gable roof, an eyebrow window, bay windows, a wrap-around porch, and fish scale shingles on the upper stories. William Jr. was a son of William Noll Sr. who founded Noll Hardware, and was involved in the family's store a few blocks away on Central Ave. * The Eli Winch house (at left in top photo) at 201 S. Vine Ave. is a classic Queen Anne style house, built in 1897 by Hans Billie, an important builder in Marshfield at the time. Characteristic features of Queen Anne are the asymmetry and complex roof. Also characteristic of Queen Anne are the bay windows, the wraparound porch, and the varied surface textures and colors with the clapboard alternating with bands of shingles. Winch owned the Marshfield Stave Factory just across the railroad tracks on Cherry and was a state legislator. Frank Cady house, Queen Anne Free Classic style, 1898 * The Frank Cady house at 400 E. 3rd Street is another Queen Anne house. It has most of the features of the Winch house above, along with a corner tower and wraparound porch - standard Queen Anne flourishes. In this house though, the round columns and pedimented gables tend toward Classical Revival style. Lawyer Frank Cady had the house built in 1898. Wahle-Laird house, Georgian Revival style, 1904 * The Wahle-Laird House at 208 S. Cherry Avenue is a fine Georgian Revival house built in 1904 by Dr. Henry Wahle. In 1923 it was bought by W.D. Connor, a lumber man and prominent progressive Republican who lived across the street, for his daughter Helen Connor Laird and her new husband Rev. Melvin Laird. Their son Melvin Laird grew up in the house and went on to become a U.S. congressman and U.S. Secretary of Defense. 305 S. Cedar on left is American Foursquare built 1905; 307 S. Cedar (dark house) is Queen Anne built 1904. * 305 S. Cedar Ave. is an American Foursquare-style house built in 1905. This style typically had a simple cube shape with hipped roof. The front porch was originally open, and it was clad in clapboard. It was built for Peter and May Weber. * The I.P. Tiffault house at 206 S. Vine (center in top photo) is a 2.5-story eclectic-styled house built in 1908. The general cube shape could be American Foursquare, but the symmetry and small pediments in the gable-fronts suggest Classical Revival style. And the horizontal lines and ribbon-windows seem a bit Prairie School. Isadoris Tiffault came from New York in 1887 to run a store with P.J. Kraus and later co-owned the Tiffault and Kamps Department Store. * The Dr. William Hipke house at 212 S. Vine Avenue is a late Queen Anne house built about 1911. By this time, people realized how much it took to keep large Queen Annes painted and to keep their complex roofs from leaking, so the designs were becoming simpler. Other than the one bay, this house has a simple rectangular shape and gable roof. It has the asymmetric wraparound porch and the shingles in the gable end characteristic of Queen Anne style, but the round columns and the cornice returns come from the Classical Revival style which was becoming popular. Dr. Hipke was one of the five founders of Marshfield Clinic. * The Schaefer house at 312 E. 3rd Street is a 2-story brick Prairie style house designed by Earl F. Miller of Manitowoc and built in 1912. Characteristics of the style are the low-pitched hip roof, the broad overhanging eaves, the ribbon windows, and the emphasis on the horizontal. This house has a porte-coch√®re on the side. P.J. Schaefer was a cheese wholesaler and vice president of the First National Bank. Around 1932 he sold the house to Dr. McGinn. Prairie style was an attempt to create a new American style of architecture - not based on European models like Italianate and Queen Anne. Bungalows on 2nd St, with 309 on right built in 1917 * The house at 309 E. 2nd Street is a good example of a bungalow - 1.5-stories with the roof ridge parallel to the street, a shed-roofed dormer, banded windows, and multiple panes in the upper sashes of the windows. Like Prairie style, the bungalow was considered modern at the time - not based on European styles - convenient, and practical for a middle-class family. * The house at 204 S. Cherry Avenue is a good example of high Colonial Revival style. Characteristic features are the hip roof, the centered front door with sidelights and fanlight above, the symmetric windows, and the porch supported by columns. This house was built in 1926. Wilson house, Tudor Revival style, 1926 * The house at 210 South Vine is Tudor Revival-styled. Characteristics of this style are the steep roof surfaces, the half-timbering, and the large chimney. The house was built in 1926 for a Mr. and Mrs. Wilson, a retired Presbyterian minister from Wausau. This last house is the only Tudor Revival in the district. By the time that style came into fashion, Pleasant Hill was full. 210 S. Vine must have replaced an earlier house, or been squeezed in when a large lot was broken into parcels. For the same reason, later styles like ranch are not found in this district, but many are found on Marshfield's west side beyond Oak Avenue, which was developed later.

The holotype was collected in February 1979 south of Santo Domingo, Ecuador. The species name \\"diminutus\\" is Latin for \\"diminutive\\". Moratelli and Wilson selected this name because M. diminutus was the smallest species of mouse-eared bat yet described in South America. Description Superficially, M. diminutus is similar to the black myotis in appearance. Very few individuals have ever been documented. Based on the measurements of one individual, a subadult male, individuals weigh approximately and have a forearm length of . Its ears are short, at in length. It has silky, cinnamon-brown fur. Its skull lacks a sagittal crest. Range The species was first documented in Ecuador. However, a review of museum specimens identified a second individual that had been collected in the Nari√±o Department of Colombia in 1959.

Background  In 1873, there arose widespread public concern pertaining to recent examples of infanticide and child abandonment. On 23 July 1873, the Sydney Morning Herald, after proclaiming that 'Infanticide has now risen to an enormous and characteristic evil', concluded that 'there is no way to meet desertion, which commonly includes infanticide, whether or not intended, but by providing a Foundling Asylum'. At the time the main institution for single mothers and their children in Sydney was the Benevolent Asylum, the Benevolent Society founded the Benevolent Asylum in 1821. Some of the women advocating for a new foundling hospital claimed that the Benevolent Asylum was not meeting the needs of single pregnant women. A Mrs EB Parnell raised concerns about the Benevolent Society's requirement for a woman to be interviewed by a committee (of men) before she could be admitted to the Asylum Born from this public concern about 'forty ladies of Sydney' met to discuss how there existed a gap in the existing charitable institutions of Sydney to meet the 'special requirements of this child of immorality and distress ‚Äì and hence, it might be inferred, the lamentable frequency of infanticide' From this initial meeting The Sydney Foundling Institution was founded in May 1874 as a non-church affiliated refuge for abandoned babies and single mothers, run by a committee of women. This committee of women included the afore mentioned Mrs EB Parnell (President) Mrs Bensusan, Mrs. G.F Wise, Mrs E Deas Thomson, Lady Murray, Mrs Henry Moore, Mrs Fischer, Mrs Alexander, Mrs Holt, Mrs John Smith and Mrs St. John. Challenging the approach taken by other institutions at the time whose charter was to separate mother and child, The Sydney Foundling Institution championed the notion than mothers and babies must be kept together in the first instance. Its first location was on Victoria Street, Darlinghurst, The Foundling Institution was unique at the time for being governed entirely by women with reports of the Institution being 'well marshalled by the elite of Sydney female society'. The first abandoned baby left on the steps was named by the committee, Sydney Hope, named after the city he was born and for the hope he inspired. In the hospital, 15; left at the door, or in places continuous to the hospital, 14; admitted on the application of their mothers, 14, and admitted with their mothers, 12; total, 55. This number is disposed of as follows: Deaths, 24; adopted by well-to-do respectable childless couples, 3; left with their mothers, 9; and present in the institution on 1 June 1876, 21: total 55. In October 1874, the institution changed its name to the Sydney Foundling Hospital and soon after, in 1875, moved to Stewart Street, Paddington. Over time it became apparent that the inner city location was not conducive an environment for healthy babies and restrictive in terms of space requirements. In 1877, the Hospital was moved out of Paddington into new premises, following Thomas Walker donating a 4.5 acre property in Henry Street, Ashfield named Gorton. From then on the organisation was known as The Infants' Home.  1890s‚Äì1920s  One of the pressing concerns for The Infants' Home during the early years was the high mortality rate. During the first year, of the forty-five children admitted twenty-six deaths occurred, however over time with the improvements reaped from the rural life at the new location in Ashfield as well as the care taken by the new matron Louise Taplin the mortality rate dropped over time reaching nil for the first time in 1937. Matron Louise Taplin is a pivotal figure during this time, at which her dedication is epitomised by building expansions, improvements to the health and sanitation and fundraising initiatives. Following her passing in 1901, considered a great tragedy, she was buried at the nearby St John's Ashfield cemetery. The First World War impacted The Infants' Home with an increase in one parent homes or an increase in children orphaned by the war, the continued need for The Infants' Home's services were integral. Change was also felt predominantly in a reflection in a changing of social mores at the time. Mothers did not stay at the Home as long as they once did, with many mothers going on to live with friends and relatives, where once these mothers were completely shunned. In 1924, The Infants' Home successfully lobbied for incorporation through an Act of Parliament. The Infants' Home, Ashfield Act 1924 (13/1924) has the full title 'An Act to incorporate the members of a society which conducts the Infants' Home, Ashfield; to promote the objects of the said society'. This Act made the Infants' Home, Ashfield a statutory corporation (a body specially set up by Parliament) with its land protected by law. This enabled The Infants' Home board to be able to sell any of the land and be able to use the profits to reinvest into the organisation as well as giving legitimacy and leverage for official negotiations.  1930s‚Äì1960s  A nursery school was opened by Dame Enid Lyons in 1936 providing stimulation for the children in residence, the first of its kind for children in Australian institutional care. World War Two brought financial difficulties to the Home as well as record numbers of attendance with 1941 reporting 309 children being admitted to the Home In the late 1940s it was agreed that the organisation would need to employ more nurses, maintenance staff and for the first time a social worker, an important indication of the changing nature of charities at this time from volunteers to paid professional workforce. The increased need for paid trained staff and the growing numbers of children in care put pressure on the capabilities of the Home and for the first time in the history of the organisation a mortgage was put on property, investments sold and a call for public support that of which would be integral lest the organisation have to be shut down. With the assistance of private donations and government subsidies The Infants Home continued its operations.  1960s‚Äì1990s  In 1965, The Infants' Home was adopted by the crew of HMAS Sydney in memory of the men who lost their lives on the Royal Australian Navy destroyer Voyager. The Voyager had supported The Infants' Home and when the ship tragically collided with HMAS Melbourne the men of the Sydney decided to continue this support. In 1972, an overhaul of The Infants' Home operations took place in which the offering of residential care ceased with long daycare centres taking its place. Moving away from the institutionalised care that characterised it's nearly 100 years of operation to flexible care options for all families. In 1974 the Australian Federal government introduced a family day scheme, whereby childcare would take place in private homes for small groups of children. The Infants' Home was one of the first organisations to offer family day care when they were invited to participate in the pilot scheme. In 1977 The Women and Children's Stress Centre is established to support children and families at risk. This would soon become an important service for the local community with 3464 calls being made from distressed women in 1988.  1990s‚Äìpresent  In 1994, a new government childcare accreditation system was introduced and The Infants' Home was chosen to be one of 32 centres Australia wide to be involved in the pilot accreditation study. 1996 saw the closure of The Women and Children's Stress Centre, The Infants' Home women's refuge for mothers escaping domestic violence. The Presidents‚Äô Report for the year reported the sadness of the closure but given the increase in government led programs in the area as well as the raised safety concerns for families and staff the closure was deemed inevitable. The 1996 budget decision to withdraw operational subsidies from community based long day care impacted The Infants' Home, the staff and board agreed that's fees should not be raised out of concern for the financial situation of local families and from this tension came the introduction of sessional care was brought in to allow families flexibility in their childcare arrangements. In 2013, The Infants' Home expanded with the addition of two new licensed childcare centres, increasing capacity to care for an extra 600 a year. The reopening ribbon cutting ceremony saw The Infants‚Äô Home patron Nicholas Shehadie attend. Today The Infants' Home provides Award-winning integrated, early intervention long day care, family day care, postnatal services, playgroups and parenting workshops. Thirty per cent of onsite services are targeted to support children and families living with vulnerabilities or who have additional needs.  Controversies  The early years of The Infants' Home posed a challenge with public backlash accusing The Infants' Home of condoning immoral behaviour. In 1877, some members of the Legislative Assembly opposed money being given with one member claiming the institution was 'a premium for bastardy' and another objecting that it 'relieved the fathers of illegitimate children from their natural responsibilities'  Patrons  The Infants' Home has been honoured over many years with the patronage of viceregal consorts of the Governor of New South Wales. The first recorded instance of official viceregal consort patronage was after Mrs John Nortcott who during her time as patron became Lady Northcott in 1946 with the appointment of her husband Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott to the position of Governor of New South Wales. She served as patron until the retirement of her husband in 1957. Amy Woodward, wife of Lieutenant General Sir Eric Woodward served as patron between the years of 1957‚Äì1965. Lady Cutler , wife of Sir Roden Cutler served as patron between the years of 1966‚Äì1981. Both of them took a keen interest in The Infants‚Äô Home with Sir Cutler and Lady Cutler opening a new day care centre in 1972. Lady Rowland, wife of Air Marshall Sir James Gowland served between the years of 1981‚Äì1989. Lady Suzanne Martin, wife of Rear Admiral Sir David James Martin served between the years of 1989‚Äì1990.

Background By 1638, with the blessing of the Matilde of Savoy, the order of the nuns of the Visitation, founded by Jeanne-Fran√ßoise Fr√©miot de Chantal, were able to found a monastery at the site. Under Matilde's patronage, they were able to commission the church from the architect Francesco Lanfranchi. The chamfered corner location gives the tall Baroque-style domed church a scenographic quality. As typical of Piedmontese Baroque architecture, the dome is close to the entrance. The layout is that of a Greek cross, with an opening from the presbytery to a large chapel-like area, now the sanctuary of the Passion, where the nuns could attend services apart from the community. This area now holds the remains of the blessed Marco Antonio Durando. The interior was decorated with frescoes by a team of artists, including Luigi Vannier in the ceiling of the presbytery. The elaborate dome frescoes, however, were painted over a century after the church's construction, circa 1768, by Michele Antonio Milocco. It depicts the Glory of St Francis of Sales (canonized in 1665). In the pendants of the dome are depicted the Theological Virtues. Other works inside the church are the stucco statuary in the presbytery by Cristoforo Ciseri. There are twenty canvases on the presbytery walls attributed to Giovanni Sacchetti. The polychrome main altar, with Solomonic columns of black marble, is attributed to Carlo and Giuseppe Busso, while the main altarpiece, initially was a canvas depicting the Visitation of Mary and Elizabeth by Vannier. This was later replaced by a painting of the same topic by Ignazio Nepote. In the chapel to the left, dedicated to St Francis of Sales and Alessandro Trona, is an altar (1730) designed by Filippo Juvarra. The altarpiece depicts St Francis providing the rules of the Order to the Saint Giovanna Francesca Fremiot di Chantal. Chantal was ultimately canonized in 1768. During the French occupation of the Piedmont under Napoleon, the convent was deconsecrated and the nuns expelled. The site was returned only to the church in 1830, when it was granted to the Congregation of the Mission of Saint Vincent de Paul, who still hold the site. Under the patronage of the blessed Marco Antonio Durando, the order restored the church. In 1838, they added a chapel on the right dedicated to their founder, St Vincent de Paul. Frescoes for the nun's choir, depicting scenes from the Passion of Christ were painted by Paolo Emilio and Luigi Morgari.Official site of the Vicenziani of Turin, entry on church.

Walt, which focuses on the foreign policy of the U.S. Government. According to the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Walt unveils the reality of White House foreign policy and argues that past U.S. presidents such as Clinton, Bush and Obama, avoided accountability for repeated failures of their foreign policies. He also argues that such foreign policy mistakes contributed to the election of Donald Trump as president. In the book, Walt offers his take on what U.S. foreign policy should be and suggests that U.S. politicians should change their foreign policy approach. Content In this book, Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University, reviews U.S. foreign policy and its results over the past quarter century. Lloyd Green, of The Guardian website writes that Walt places the onus for what he argues is the decline of the U.S. on its foreign policy, and that he argues for an \\"offshore balancing strategy\\", under which the U.S. would allow regional actors to play out their own conflicts. This foreign policy strategy is similar to the approach of ex- President Richard Nixon. The author argues that the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars abroad fighting terrorists, attempting to expand democracy, or ensuring the security of other countries. He also believes that these strategies failed to achieve their goal. The author presents an analysis of the foreign policies used by the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations. He goes on to argue that these foreign policy strategies were failures and the presidents responsible have been able to avoid accountability. Walt argues that past presidential failures facilitated Donald Trump's bid to become U.S. president. The author argues that U.S. foreign policies in other countries have changed over time from using military force to expanding democracy to maintaining a balance of power. The author outlines a number of different potential foreign policy strategies. He explores some of these policies, including: offshore balancing, which calls for the U.S. to focus its offshore capabilities on Europe, the Persian Gulf, and Northeast Asia, using favored regional powers to check the rise of potentially-hostile powers; and the Nixon Doctrine, a position expounded by ex-President Nixon, that every crisis does not warrant American troops and firepower, and that American involvement can engender resentment and blowback in American society. Walt declares to his readers the folly of grand ambitions and says \\"doing something\\" can be far more costly than watching and waiting. Finally, Walt proposes his own foreign policy strategy. He advocates for offshore balancing, a return to diplomacy, and the prioritizing of peace.

The same group of musicians went on the road with the Perry on the Have Guitar, Will Travel Tour, The band opened up for national acts like Bad Company and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, while also making an appearance as the musical guest on Late Night with David Letterman, performing \\"Slingshot\\" from the album with Santo stepping out from behind the keyboards to play guitar and Perry singing the lead vocals. 425x425pxAt the beginning of 2012, Santo (Hammond organ), along with Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford (Brass Synth Guitar), Warren Huart (Acoustic guitar), Jack Douglas (Drums), and Joe Perry (Electric and Slide Guitars, Bass, Vocal) recorded a \\"very cool\\" rendition\\" of the Bob Dylan classic \\"Man of Peace\\" for Chimes of Freedom in honor of Amnesty International USA. They also performed the song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno with Santo once again playing guitar with Perry. = With Ringo Starr = When former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr returned to the studio to begin work on his latest album Ringo Rama he brought back his longtime friend and producer, Mark Hudson. Who, in turn, brought in Paul Santo, who he had worked with previously on an Aerosmith album, as part of the production team. This would be Ringo Starr's 13th studio album, and as is always the case with the former ‚ÄúBeatle,‚Äù he proved that he still had his \\"star power\\" in the music industry and brought in some of legendary names in music for the recording. Musicians like David Gilmour, Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, and Charlie Haden are just a few of the artists that stopped by. Santo, working as the sound engineer, split time between recording at Starr's recording studio in London, Rocca Bella, and Hudson's Whatinthewhatthe? Studios in Los Angeles. The sessions were produced by Starr, who also made a documentary of the making of ‚ÄúRingo Rama‚Äù. Santo, being an accomplished musician, also played multiple instruments on the album and co-wrote the song \\"I Think Therefore I Rock and Roll\\". = \\"Tears in Heaven\\" = Following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami that devastated Southeast Asia, Paul Santo joined an all-star cast of musicians the included: Elton John, Rod Stewart, Steven Tyler, Ozzy Osbourne, Phil Collins, Ringo Starr, Gavin Rossdale, Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige, Pink, Kelly Osbourne, Katie Melua, Josh Groban, Andrea Bocelli and members of Velvet Revolver: Slash, Duff McKagan, Matt Sorum, Dave Kushner and Scott Weiland. The recording also featured actor Robert Downey Jr.to perform on a cover version of the Eric Clapton song \\"Tears in Heaven\\". The collaboration was organized by Mark Hudson, Ozzy Osbourne, his wife Sharon, and daughter Kelly Osbourne for the Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake with all sales from the recording going to benefit the victims and recovery. Funds raised from the project went to the Save the Children charity. = \\"Boston Strong\\" = In response to the tragic Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, a line-up of high-profile acts, with roots in the Boston area, performed to a sold-out crowd at the TD Garden for a ‚ÄúBoston Strong‚Äù benefit concert for the victims of the attack. Aerosmith, headlined the show, which also featured local groups like the New Kids on the Block (Donnie Wahlberg was actually the one credited with concert idea.), The J. Geils band, featuring Peter Wolf, Jimmy Buffett and James Taylor, along with many others. Aerosmith, which formed in the city back in 1970, has always been synonymous with the Boston throughout their entire career. Even being famously called the \\"Bad Boys from Boston\\" during their heyday. Members of the band raised their families in the area and still own homes in the suburbs of Boston. Due to the urgent need, scheduling, and nature of the show, the promoters behind the concert had only a matter days to put the event together. (It also sold out all 19,600 seats in about 5 minutes.) Unfortunately, due to a family member undergoing a major surgery, Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford was unable to perform with the band at the event. On very short notice and without any time for rehearsal, Paul Santo, who lives in the Boston area, stepped in with Aerosmith (who had just returned from a show in Singapore the day before) and took Whitford's place on stage with the rest of band. The concert was considered a great success for the \\"One fund.\\" Which was established almost immediately after the tragic event and before the concert had already raised $27 million for the victims.

His guitar style, while diverse, tends to be rooted in an amalgam of both English blues-rock players from the 1960s and 1970s and Fender Telecaster-playing American country players. Drumming is also rooted in Brits like Ringo Starr and Keith Moon but also American soul and funk drummers.

He was born in Guizhou to a poor family, and became an orphan at a young age. He married in his 30s and had a daughter. Augustus Chapdelaine, a French missionary went to Guangxi in the 1850s to preach the gospel. At this time, Christian missionaries were forbidden to enter the interior of China away from the treaty ports. Bai was baptized as a Catholic in 1855 and took the name 'Lawrence'. He became closely attached to Chapdelaine. He was a Catholic for only a year before he was put to death. A the time, a bitter civil war was being fought in China between the Taiping rebels and the Qing government. The Taipings were Christians who believed that their leader Hong Xiuquan was the brother of Jesus Christ. The rebellion had started in Guangxi and the Qing armies massacred huge numbers of civilians in areas that were associated with the rebellion. Augustus Chapdelaine was known in Guangxi for carrying out missionary activities in a way that offended traditional Chinese customs and culture, especially concerning ancestor worship. In addition, there were accusations that he was having sexual relations with female Christians. In 1856, Chapdelaine was arrested by Qing authorities and they decided to execute him rather than to deport him to one of the Chinese treaty ports where European missionaries were legally permitted to stay. Bai Xiaoman spoke out against his sentence and was arrested by the Qing authorities. Fifteen others were also arrested in association with this episode, including another saint named Agnes Tsao Kou Ying who was also put to death. After his arrest, they demanded that Bai Xiaoman renounce his Christianity and he refused and so he was executed along with the others in Xilinxian. He was executed in front of his wife and child, and before being put to death he called for his wife to keep the Ten Commandments and to teach the faith to their child. He was beheaded on 25 February 1856 in Guangxi and his body was dumped in a wooded area for wild animals to eat. He is listed in the Martyrologium Romanum.

History According to South Australian local government historian Sue Marsden \\"development of South Australia's South East was greatly helped by drainage schemes. Elsewhere in South Australia the Local Board of Main Roads was the precursor to local government, but in the South East it was district drainage boards.\\" The original South-East Drainage District was formed in April 1876. Part of this district and part of the Tantanoola Drainage District within the vicinity of the Hundred of Mount Muirhead were split off later in 1876 to form a new drainage district called Mount Muirhead Drainage District. In 1879 the Mount Muirhead district was expanded to include more of the South-East district. On 27 April 1882 both the Mount Muirhead and South-East districts were dissolved and a new (second) Mount Muirhead Drainage District was established along with the new drainage district of Mayurra. The District Council of Mount Muirhead was established in 1888 by the enactment of the District Councils Act 1887, a statewide legislative push to ensure all settled areas of the state be under local governance. It stated that all existing drainage districts (and the accompanying drainage boards) were to effectively become district councils. On 4 June 1914, Mount Muirhead district was annexed by the District Council of Millicent.

These portrayals often depict an ethnocentric perception of Arabs rather than an authentic and realistic depiction of Arabic cultures, religions, dialects, as well as customs and traditions. Key issues that have been explored in these portrayals include how Arabs are identified in mainstream Hollywood film, how Arabs self-represent themselves in their own film, with examples from Egyptian cinema, Palestinian cinema, as well as Syrian cinema. There has also been the portrayal of Arab women in film, the portrayal of Arabs post 9/11, the portrayal of Arabs in animated film, and positive portrayals and negative portrayals of Arabs.  How Arabs are identified in mainstream Hollywood films  Throughout the history of Hollywood, Arabs have been portrayed in many different racial stereotypes in both Western culture and film. Often portrayed as barbaric, as oil sheikhs, and most famously, terrorists. In most forms of Western media, Arabs are portrayed in a negative light, often in stereotypical roles. Two films that have portrayed Arabs as being barbaric are Rules of Engagement (2000) and Death Before Dishonor (1987). = Arabs as Barbaric = Rules of Engagement (2000): This film was produced in cooperation with the US Marine Corps and the US Department of Defense. The film also received cooperation from the Moroccan government to film it in Morocco. The film has been described as one of the most blatantly anti-Arab scenarios, as well as being an appalling defamation of Yemeni people which encourages its viewers to hate Arab Muslims. During its opening weekend, it reached number one at the box office, and grossed at roughly $15,000,000. One critic wrote that this film's message was that a command to kill eighty-three Yemeni people was completely justified, since the Yemeni in this film were portrayed as hateful marine-killers as well as anti-American terrorists. Some film critics were outraged by the film and commented on how no attempts were made to humanize the Yemeni, but rather, portray them as stock villains; human cattle that were ready for herding and slaughter to demonstrate the righteousness and mightiness of the US officer's role. Hussein Ibish, who is a spokesman for the American-Arab Anti Discrimination Committee, described this film as one of the most racist films that was ever produced about Arabs. Other critics of the movie saw it as unrealistic and that the Hollywood industry was running out of villains to place in their films, so they just stuck with the violent Arab characters. Critics saw that the film was sending a message that as long as there is an Americans‚Äô life at stake, it is acceptable to kill foreigners to save the American. The most controversial point was why Arabs or Muslims were a part of the film, as the original screenplay written by James Webb did not have any Arabs or Muslims in it. Death Before Dishonor (1987): In the film, US Marine Sergeant Jack Burns is sent on a mission to Israel. Fighting alongside Israelis and US marines, they defeat baby-murdering Palestinian terrorists as well as a German terrorist. In a scene in the film, a Palestinian terrorist asks a spying houseboy whether he would like to get back at the marines and that Allah would praise him for doing so. The boy nods in agreement and proceeds to blow up the US Embassy as well as himself. The scene then cuts to rumble everywhere, (the aftermath of the bombing incident), with a damaged US flag and a child's doll amongst the rumble. The US Ambassador sighs and asks what sort of savages would do such a thing, then leave blood everywhere. He then observes a dead marine's corpse and comments on how his own mother wouldn't even recognize him. The New York Times critic, Janet Maslin, wrote that this film portrays Palestinians terrorists that are worthless, lying scum.  Arab self-representation in film  = Religious identities in Arab film production: National and moral imaginaries = There are three main approaches in film that closely associate the larger Arab identity with just the Muslim Identity, disregarding other religions and beliefs in the Arab region. Some Arabic films address other religions and beliefs as part of the larger Arab identity, but the majority of Arab films still intertwine Muslim and Arab identity as being one, both implicitly as well as explicitly. The first approach is in how main historical Arab religious films have had a tendency to explicitly address religious identity through the telling of Islamic history, and, as such, convey a historically deep-rooted Muslim identity. The second approach is in how large numbers of dramas that get produced implicitly display religion. This is either displayed in the set's location (e.g. a mosque), or displayed through the character's behaviour (e.g. visiting a shrine or praying on a Muslim prayer mat). This approach displays the Muslim identity as being the moral compass used to address ethical as well as social aspects of everyday life. The third approach is in how a film gets to set parameters on how a Muslim is defined, whether a bad Muslim character or a good Muslim character. This is usually prone to stereotyping.  Picturing historical Islam  Ibrahim ‚ÄòIzz al-Din, director of the Egyptian film Zuhur al-Islamv (1951), depicts life in the Arab Peninsula before the rise of Islam. The film was originally inspired by the historical novel Al- Wa‚Äôd Al-Haq (The True Promise, 1950), by Egyptian writer Taha Hussein, who tried to rewrite Islamic history. It depicted how the first Muslims struggled with their new belief, opposed by worshipers of other gods or religions. These first Muslims were tortured. However, despite that, they persisted and kept faithful to their newly acquired religion. Quite a number of similar films were produced, all depicting Islam to be victorious in its emergence during its early years. However, none of these films were historically accurate. These films symbolically represented the re-emergence of national identity after colonial rule, relating to mainly resurfaced views on morality. These films failed in accurately depicting the story of Islam's military victories, but rather, represented the moral restoration of people whose morals were repressed under colonialism. With the increase of the significance of Islam as being tied to Arab identity, the genre of the historical religious dramas gained increasing popularity with television shows, series, as well as film. This depiction of Muslims being victims of slander and colonialism whilst also being victorious, has become a popular character mold again after the events of 9/11, as Muslims had to suffer with stigmatization by the West.  Everyday realism with religious elements  The ‚Äòeveryday drama‚Äô is one of the most popular genres in Arab cinema. Religion in films of this genre plays an implicit role in the setting, characters, actions, or symbols, which predominantly are identified as being Muslim, the religion of the protagonists and their society. Some of the images that feature in these films include images of mosques, as well as churches and synagogues, images of women wearing the hijab as well as images of women wearing the cross around their necks, images of saints, shrines, people praying, as well as secularists, atheists, fundamentalists, magic, religious violence, and the call to prayer. There are images of the Islamic pilgrimage (the Hajj), images of the holy Islamic feasting month of Ramadan, the two holy annual Islamic holy feats and Christmas. Therefore, religious values are portrayed as a natural part of daily life in these films, regardless of the fact that the film or its storyline is not directly about religion itself. Religious values in these everyday dramas are often portrayed as a social struggle against injustice rather than a religious one, which is embodied in the protagonist or hero, who represent the ideal human and moral way of behaving. The protagonist is exposed to injustice and opposes it in a civil manner, a manner that is rooted from tradition, morals, fairness, as well as other positive human values. In religious historical films, moral and ethical values which derive from Islamic tradition, are the natural answer to social injustice. This further emphasizes the inherent as well as natural behaviour or character of religious identity. This identity is further strengthened by visualizing Islamic tradition as being evident in so aspects of daily life. Two particular examples which are popularly used in depicting a Muslim identity in the everyday drama genre, is the call to prayer as well as the use of holy places and sites.  What makes a film \\"Arab\\"?  In an interview conducted by Jack Thomas Taylor, an assistant curator at The Media Majlis of Northwestern University in Qatar, with the film scholar and filmmaker Viola Shafik, she was asked what makes a film ‚ÄòArab‚Äô. Her response argued that it was a controversial topic because the Arab region is vast and the term ‚ÄòArab‚Äô in itself could be interpreted from many different perspectives such as from a colonial perspective or an orientalist perspective. She also goes on by arguing that Pan-Arabism and Arab Nationalism are ideologies that were trying to unify all Arab states into one identity, disregarding the fact that the Arab region is a region of ethnic and linguistic diversity, religious diversity, as well as geographical and historical differences.  The terms \\"Arab\\" and \\"Arabia\\" as makeshift terms  Shafik was also asked whether the term ‚ÄòArab‚Äô was sufficient enough to represent all aspects of the region's culture, as well as the ways in which that has influenced fictional ‚ÄòArab‚Äô character that has been so often stereotyped in film. Her response was that since she was a student of Oriental Studies in Germany, she was trained to observe the ‚ÄòArab‚Äô region from a psychological lens. Language was one aspect that was studied. The Arabic language in itself was not enough to combine to group the region; therefore, the vernacular as well as colloquial cultures and differences had to be taken into consideration. Shafik also said that she gets offended at the terms ‚ÄòArab‚Äô and ‚ÄòArabia‚Äô as a nation, especially how Arabia has been popularly portrayed as this imaginary world from One Thousand and One Nights, a place which she claims she does not know of but apparently still exists in film. Shafik goes on by saying that the word ‚ÄòArab‚Äô was a word that was constructed, and understanding the definition of it as well as the definition of ‚Äòothering‚Äô, is crucial in terms of understanding how this construction of this word was used as a tool to demonize, essentialize, as well as fetishize the other. This process has spread its course over the region influencing this imaginary ‚ÄòArabia‚Äô as well as the character of the so-called Arab. This othering process is now inevitable and cannot reverse its impacts on the region, especially given the region's colonial history. In the years following decolonization as well as post-colonial era, stereotypes of Arabs in film started to emerge. One stereotype was that of the Arab being a terrorist, which essentially was a result of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Another stereotype was the Arab being the villains which was very much evident and popular in films produced in France as well as the United States, that date back as early as the 1920s and 1930s, and even more popular in the 1940s, especially during the rule of the French in Algeria where a strong resistance to the French was forming. A direct consequence of the resistance that happened between these Arab colonies towards colonization, was the birth of vilifying the Arab and the Bedouin in western film, and the blood-thirst associated to these cultures, stereotypically. In western film, there have been some attempts in trying to politically correct this stereotype, however, these attempts have not been enough to completely deconstruct of dissect the othering of Arabs in film, especially in films produced by Hollywood.  Palestinian cinema  Divine Intervention (2002): The film Divine Intervention is based on the lives of Palestinians under the Israeli occupation, and how their day-to-day lives are. The main character is played by the director of the film, Elia Suleiman. He does not speak throughout the film, which gives out the idea of how life under the Israeli occupation is draining him. Divine Intervention is shot in a comedic way that is also very powerful and effective. The shots are left without any dialogue to allow the viewer to analyze the scenes themselves. However, the film has some comedic scenes, such as one neighbor bickering about how the other neighbor leaves the trash in front of their house. Another scene is when a red balloon appears with Yasser Arafat's face on it. The balloon floats over the Israeli checkpoint, focusing on the faces of the Israeli soldiers and how they were contemplating about whether they should shoot the balloon down or not. They get so caught up with the balloon that they do not notice a car that goes by the checkpoint. The film also shows a love story between a Palestinian man and woman. The man lives in Jerusalem and the woman lives in Ramallah. In order for them to see one another, they would have to go through various checkpoints. Viewers are left to see them meeting in the car near one of the checkpoints, every time they wanted to see one another, which was the only was they would be able to spend time with each other. According to The Guardian, Divine Intervention has been rejected by the Academy of Motion Picture for the category of Best Foreign Picture in the Oscars since they do not feel like Palestine is not a recognized or real nation. Another point The Guardian highlighted was that English was only spoken a twice in the film by a tourist that needed directions. They also tied this to another scene which was aimed towards showing how Israelis do not know anything, which is when the tourist asked for directions to the Church of Holy Sepulchre. The Israeli soldier did not know the directions so he got the blindfolded Palestinian man from the police car and told him to assist the tourist by giving her directions to the church. The Guardian also see the film as unrealistic and making certain scenes comedic by humiliating or belittling the Israeli soldiers, such as how they were distracted by the red balloon that had Yasser Arafat's image on it which made them not notice the car that was passing by the checkpoint.  Syrian cinema  The Day I Lost My Shadow (2018): Directed by Soudade Kaadan, the film takes place in 2012, telling the story of a mother, Sana, who is raising her eight-year-old boy in Syria during the events of the war. In her attempt to get a gas cylinder, she meets a brother and sister who are also looking for a gas cylinder, and they end up taking a taxi to a city nearby to get it. They face many obstacles while they are trying to get the gas cylinders, but one thing Sana notices is how people lose their shadows once they have lost someone they love due to the war. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Soudade Kaadan, the French-born Syrian director, won the Lion of the Future award at the Venice Film Festival for her remarkable work on the film. The story was told from a female voice, regarding the daily lives of Syrians during the war. The female voice perspective is what helped Soudade Kaadan in winning the award since it is rare that a female voice is able to deliver a message of power throughout a production.  Egyptian cinema  Cairo Station (1958): Cairo Station was directed and produced by Arabs for their self-depiction, and the film had a fairly truthful and accurate depiction of Egyptian society at the time. Every major sector of society, every mindset, every community in Egypt, was represented. The film even represented a minority in society which were not commonly acknowledged or represented in film characters: the mentally ill, as well as the physically disabled. Cairo Station exhibited a character, Qinawi, who was both a cripple as well as a sexually frustrated pervert, whose obsession with a woman working at the station, Hanouma, spiralled out of control. Cairo Station is seen as the film that spread Youssef Chahine‚Äôs name on a global level. The stylistic movement that the film resembled the most was Italian neo-realism. The film was shot from start to end at one single location; a train station. It was a location where people from all around the country crossed at some point. Featured in the movie are urban Egyptians and rural Egyptians, conservative religious traditionalists as well as liberal westernized rock and roll musical groups of Egyptians, people from the upper most elite class of Egyptian society as well as people from the labor working class. Different dialects can also be heard amongst the Egyptians as well as different cultural dress wear and customs. The movie also shows Egypt's social hierarchy functioned, and how people from different social classes interacted with one another.  Islamophobia and film  Islamophobia is the fear of the Islamic religion and the Muslim culture, which results in violent acts towards the Muslims due to the anxiety that others have from their religious acts. After the incident of the Christchurch shooting, Rizwan Wadan, a camera technician, produced a short four-minute film called The Martyrs, which showcased three Islamophobic crimes that happened to Muslims in the past. This included a pregnant woman being kicked in the stomach, a stabbing, and an acid attack. The film was made with the intention of showing what Muslims and Arabs go through at times. However, the film received a lot of controversy not only from non-Arabs and non-Muslims, but also by Muslims, mosques and the Tell MAMA organization, which monitors anti- Muslim hate crimes. Tell MAMA, mosques, and the people from the Muslim community asked for the film to be removed from all platforms and all film festivals as the film would create a greater fear within the Muslim community. It would make the Muslim community too afraid to go out, in fear of being put in the same situations that the short film had shown. Fiyaz Mughal, the founder of Tell MAMA, criticized the film and asked that it be taken down as it might encourage violence against Muslims if the wrong person watches it. Wadan replied to all these controversies by stating that Muslims are always complaining about how they are being portrayed in a negative manner in films. His vision was for Muslims to start telling their own stories, which is what he did with The Martyrs. His aim of making this film was not to have people like it, but instead to make an impact and tell the stories of Muslims from the Muslim perspective, not from the Western perspective. Wadan also argues that his film is not something that Muslims and others should be worried about since nowadays, with social media, people are watching videos of what has happened in the Christchurch shooting on their phones. Wadan stated that videos like those are what actually cause fear within the Muslim community and his film should not be removed.  Portrayal of Arab women in film  Ever since the 1960s, Arab women have been portrayed in various ways in Hollywood films. They are usually portrayed either as the belly dancer, the oppressed woman or as maidens. These portrayals led the Westerners to view Arab women as only that. The very first portrayals of Arab women as a veiled belly dancer was in two silent black and white films, Fatima (1897) and Fatima‚Äôs Dance (1907). Both films starred the actress Fatima. Arab women are often also sexualized and objectified in terms of being maidens that are there to serve the need of the Arab sheikh. This is also portrayed in the remake of Around the World in Eighty Days (2004) by Disney, where the Arab sheikh had around a hundred wives and were objectified through the scenes of them doing nothing other than waiting for the time to serve the need of the sheikh. Pretty Persuasion (2005) A young Palestinian woman who attends school in Beverly Hills, gets bullied for wearing a hijab, gets stereotypical comments thrown her way everyday and ends up killing herself. Oil (1977) In an attempt to get the oil prices down, a white male and his six colleagues visit a mythical Arab country and try to convince the sheikhs to lower the oil prices. During their stay in the Arab nation, they visit a restaurant in which they are entertained by belly dancers in a performance. Abdullah the Great aka. Abdullah‚Äôs Harem (1955) The film portrays an Arab sheikh, Abdullah, and a European model, Ronnie. Ronnie is trying to bring down Abdullah's Arab monarch. Abdullah is always in the company of the Arab women that he bought, along with belly dancers. Even though Abdullah has all these women by his side, he still tries to seduce Ronnie, but Ronnie refuses. He then attempts to drug Ronnie in order to sleep with her, but he fails and gets dethroned. The only person that stands by his side is a belly dancer named Aziza.  Portrayal of Arabs in film post-9/11  After the events of 9/11 in 2001, it became a trend in the Western and Hollywood films to portray Arabs as terrorists in hundreds of movies that were being produced. Women in headscarves and dark-looking men were seen as a threat, so that became associated with terrorism in the Hollywood film industry's way of stereotyping Arabs and Muslims. The Kingdom (2007) This movie talks about four FBI agents that fly off to Saudi Arabia, with only one mission, which is to find those responsible for the bombing of an American non-military facility. In a film review by The Guardian, the author mentions how the film is a typical Hollywood film that depicts Arabs as the villains and Americans as the ones who have to protect themselves at all costs in the Gulf region. The author also highlights how it is typical of Hollywood to have a group of bad Arabs and one good Arab that is trying to undo what the bad Arabs did. Air Marshal (2003) An Israeli film exploiting the 9/11 victims and showcasing Arab characters that have hijacked a jet and are killing passengers. They are then brought down by the U.S. Air Marshall that was on board. The Stone Merchant (2006) This film was seen as one of the most disturbing movies after the 9/11 incident. It showcases Arabs at an airport in Rome killing the passengers. It also shows how they made a bomb out of radioactive material and made it go off in Dover Harbor, killing the people that were on the ferry. In an article by Variety, the portrayal of Arab Muslims is mentioned as objectionable in terms of the characters that were chosen to play the roles of the Arab Muslims. All Arab Muslims were depicted as dark skinned, violent and murderers. The article also mentions how one of the characters in the film is dedicated to showing his students how Islam and Muslims are a threat to Westerners and the Western culture. One of the scenes in the film is discussed where one of the characters mentions that Muslims are not all terrorists, but a large number of the terrorists are from the Muslim culture.  Portrayal of Arabs in silent film  One Arabian Night (1920) In this German silent film, a greedy sheikh is portrayed with his maidens. His favorite maiden runs off with a merchant. He asks his guards to get him a new maiden, which happens to be a Western dancer that was touring the country. The Western dancer is kidnapped to satisfy the sheikhs needs. The sheikh then kills her in fear of his son falling in love with the Western dancer, which is then followed by the killing of his son. The Gift Girl (1917) An orphaned girl is brought up in a country called Arabia, and is forced to marry a fat Arab merchant when she is all grown up. The girl then runs off to Paris and falls in love with a student there. The Arab merchant then shows up in Paris and tries to take his wife back to Arabia with him, but is fought off by the student and fails in taking his wife back with him. The Lady of the Harem (1926) An Arab sheikh loves women. He has his soldiers kidnap Pervanah, a blonde woman, for him. Pervanah's lover, Rafi, tries to get Pervanah back by going into the castle of the sheikh with expert dagger throwers and aims the dagger at the sheikhs back, killing him. According to the synopsis by the American Film Institute, Pervanah was placed in a slave market, and Rafi had to make enough money for him to buy his lover back. The genre of the film is adventure whereas the sub-genre is Arabian.  Negative portrayal of Arabs in film  What is often seen in the Western portrayal of Arabs in films is a negative portrayal. Rarely is an Arab represented in a positive manner in Hollywood or Western films. The ways in which these films portray Arabs goes to the extent of dehumanizing them. Usually, Arabs in Western films are found lurking behind sand dunes and finding ways to terrorize the Christians and Jews. When Hollywood films portray Arabs, it is often under three themes: Islamophobic, anti-Muslim and anti-Arab. These films often generalize that all Arabs are terrorists that are out to get people who are not Muslim and often also depict Islam as a violent and oppressive religion. Promised Land (2004) An Israeli film that portrays Arab sex slavers and shows them trading and selling Eastern European women. American Dreamz (2006) A musical/comedy that shows terrorists from Al-Qaeda trying to blow up the United States president. Even though a musical/comedy is usually seen in a positive light, here it is negative in terms of how they depict Arabs. The film had various aspects that included influencing teens to go after their dreams, as well as highlighting the entertainment industry and certain political issues. The film received more negative criticism than positive appraisals. 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016) A movie that is based on the events that happened in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012, where the American Ambassador was assassinated along with an officer from the Foreign Services of the United States. The movie shows how six men that were already on the soils of Benghazi were able to fight back and save themselves and the other Americans that were there from the Arabs and Muslims that wanted to kill them. 13 Hours was made for the mere purpose of creating a larger fear in the audience about Islam and Arabs through the way that the producers were dramatizing some aspects. In a review by The Guardian, they mention how usually in films, when they portray a country as unstable, it often means that the country is filled with enemies everywhere. These types of films usually show that in countries that are unstable, you can never tell apart the heroes from the villains. This is what 13 Hours was depicting through its film. It is the ongoing story of Americans trying to survive in a land that is not theirs, while having the locals intervene in what the Americans are trying to do. Angelique and the Sultan (1968) France has released a sequence of five Angelique films, all based on the author Anne Golan‚Äôs novels. This film is the fifth film. This film displays disturbingly familiar and ugly stereotypes of Arabs. In the opening scene of the film, we see the sheikh's men, portrayed as lecherous Arabs, kidnapping Angelique and enslaving her. Furthermore, while Angelique is held hostage at the ruler's palace, two Arab Harem maidens try to knife her in her sleep. In the palace dungeon, Angelique gets whipped and branded by the sheikh's men because she threatened to commit suicide rather than have Arab men ravish her. The sheikh's men capture other European protagonists who are chained and tortured, etc.  Positive portrayal of Arabs in film  That being said, here are some of the few Hollywood films that have portrayed Arabs in a more positive light: The 13th Warrior (1998) Starring Antonio Banderas as the lead, he plays the role of Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, an exiled Arabic Ambassador from his homeland and shows his journey as he meets a group of twelve Vikings. He faces some cultural differences with them, but the Vikings then face a mission in which they would need a total of thirteen soldiers. With them only being twelve, Ahmad joins them and helps them in overcoming the mission successfully, which depicts the Arab character as a hero. Raising Arizona (1987) The film shows a scene where unexpected guests show up, and the male protagonist mentions that Arabs welcome the expected guests and the unexpected guests at any time. This shows how Arabs are hospitable. Flightplan (2005) Set on a flight to New York, the female protagonist Jodie Foster's 6-year-old daughter disappears. Foster starts looking around and points at the dark- skinned Arab passenger accusing him to kidnapping her daughter. She later on finds her daughter, who has been kidnapped by a non-Arab passenger. The closing scene of the film is of the Arab passenger that was accused of kidnapping Foster's daughter, giving her one of her bags that she had left behind. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974) This film deals with discrimination against interracial couples: more specifically in this case, discrimination against an Arab and a German who fall in love with each other. Set in post-war Germany, in the city of Munich, the protagonist is a handsome Moroccan mechanic who experiences prejudice as well as his German partner. People all around the city mock the couple, from waiters to cleaning ladies to apartment dwellers to shopkeepers. In the film, Ali begins opening up to Emma, his lover, a German widow in her 50s, and begins to admit to how he genuinely feels like Arabs are not considered actual people in Germany, but more like street dogs. He's been mistreated by the Germans and how they made him feel inhumane. We also see how Emma's own children get outraged upon the discovery of their mother being married to an Arab, when he has been nothing but a gentleman to her. Towards the end of the film, in the last few frames, we see the couple happy side by side, and that prejudices may perhaps have been learnt. Battle of the Algiers (1966) This film has provided viewers with much needed insights into the controversial of terrorism, more specifically in this film, the contrast between how Algerian civilians and the French military used different ‚Äúterror‚Äù weapons or tools in order to achieve their goals. The film was shot in the locations where the battles took place, and on exactly the same streets even. The costumes of the ‚ÄúAlgiers‚Äù characters looked authentic. A crucial scene in the film, which perfectly illustrates the war on terror, is when an Algerian rebel gets asked by a French journalist whether he thinks it is cowardly for Algerians to send off their women carrying bombs in their handbags to blow-up French civilians. The Algerian rebel replies by asking the French journalist whether it is not cowardly to blow up Algerian civilians with napalm. Therefore, if the French want the Algerians to surrender their women carrying handbags, the Algerians should have the French airplanes in exchange for them. Madame Rosa (1977) This film is set in Paris, France, and revolves around the relationship between an Arab Muslim boy and his beloved friend, an elderly Jewish woman, Rosa. She is a Jewish survivor of Nazi concentration camps, and she babysits the children of some prostitutes to earn some money, and the Arab Muslim boy, an 11-year of Algerian boy named Mohammed, happens to be one of them, and he is by far her favorite. Rosa decides to enroll Mohammed into school as a favor, but officials refused to admit him since he does not hold an official birth certificate, as well as him being an Arab, who were considered as outsiders or outcasts in France at the time. Therefore, he was unfortunately not eligible to enroll at any educational institute in France.  Efforts by the United States  One of the efforts that Americans are taking towards Arabs and the racial stereotypes that are associated with Arabs and Muslims is the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee. The committee aims to protect the civil rights of Arabs, but also playing a major role tackling discrimination against Arabs and the stereotypes as well. This goes in hand with them speaking up when films go overboard with the racial stereotyping of Arabs that may lead to the harm of any Arab or Muslim.

With a good eye and clear weather, the top of the mountain can be seen from the visitor center at Hurricane Ridge. Its nearest higher peak is Circe (6847 ft) on Mount Olympus, to the northwest. There are scrambling routes on the east side, via Noyes- Meany col, and via the ridge from Mount Queets. Due to heavy winter snowfalls, Mount Meany supports several small glaciers on its north and east slopes, despite its modest elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the headwaters of both the Elwha and Queets Rivers. History Mt. Meany, 1907 The present day Mt. Meany - Mt. Queets area was referred to as Mt. Mesachie on the 1896 Gilman National Geographic Map. The word mesachie is from the Chinook Jargon and means wicked. The mountain was named during the 1889-90 Seattle Press Expedition to honor Edmond S. Meany (1862-1935), at that time an employee of the Seattle Press who arranged the meeting between the expedition's newspaper sponsor, with Canadian James Halbold Christie, the leader of group of five which ascended the Elwha River and descended the North Fork Quinault River. Meany later became a renowned scholar and professor at the University of Washington, a Washington state legislator, and also a mountain climber who served as president of The Mountaineers. The first ascent of the mountain was made August 8, 1907, by Asahel Curtis, Lorenz Nelson, and Peter McGregor. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Meany is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, the best months for climbing are June through September. Mt.

The composition of the nine groups in the qualifying group stage was decided by the draw held on 11 December 2018, 09:00 CET (UTC+1), at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, with the teams seeded according to their coefficient ranking. The group was originally scheduled to be played in home-and-away round-robin format between 24 March 2019 and 13 October 2020. Under the original format, the group winners and the best runners-up among all nine groups (not counting results against the sixth-placed team) would qualify directly for the final tournament, while the remaining eight runners-up would advance to the play-offs. On 17 March 2020, all matches were put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1832, he met Henry Whiteley on his trip to Jamaica to whom he argued that Jamaican slaves were better off than the poor of England and therefore the British government should not interfere with the way the Jamaican planters managed their slaves; Whiteley went on to witness harsh and arbitrary whipping of slaves at the plantations that he visited during his stay. According to the Legacies of British Slave-Ownership at the University College London, Brown was awarded a payment as a slave trader in the aftermath of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 with the Slave Compensation Act 1837. The British Government took out a ¬£15 million loan (worth ¬£ in ) with interest from Nathan Mayer Rothschild and Moses Montefiore which was subsequently paid off by the British taxpayers (ending in 2015).

He participated in the Siamese Revolution of 1932 to promote democracy by overthrowing the absolute monarchy. Biography Prayoon was born on 5 February 1897 in Berlin, German Empire, where his father served as the Siamese military attach√©. His father was Major Yam Pamornmontri; his mother was a German physician. She taught German to many Siamese cadets in the German Empire at the time, many of whom later became members of the Khana Ratsadon. Prayoon, as a child, served as a royal page to King Vajiravudh (Rama VI). When he grew up, he was appointed a royal guard. He resigned to study political science in Paris. While in Europe he traveled from Switzerland to Lyon to meet with fellow Siamese student, Khuang Aphaiwong. Khuang introduced him to Pridi Banomyong, the Paris-based leader of Siamese students in French. In Paris, Pridi and Prayoon often spent their free time meeting in caf√©s or strolling the streets of Paris, talking about politics and the situation in Siam. This led to the creation of Khana Ratsadon, with Prayoon and Pridi as the first two members. The first official meeting of Khana Ratsadon was held at 9, Rue Du Sommerard on 5 February 1927, Prayoon's 30th birthday. His role in Khana Ratsadon was to contact and coordinate with other members. After absolute monarchy was overthrown in Siam, he was appointed Minister of Education in the administration of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, the Prime Minister. After World War II, he was appointed Minister of Public Health (1954‚Äì1957). In the military, he founded the Volunteer Defense Corps (VDC) and ascended to the rank of lieutenant general. He was elected as an MP for Chiang Mai as a member of the Seri Manangkasila Party in the February 1957 Thai general election.

As a military leader, he became successful during the Pruth River Campaign (1710‚Äì1711). By the Treaty of Pruth (1711), Peter the Great of the Russian Empire agreed to provide a free passage for King Charles XII of Sweden to return to his country. The next year, Aƒüa Yusuf Pasha was appointed grand vizier. However, although a component commander, he lacked the skill of a statesman. When Peter the Great refused to allow a free passage for Charles XII, Ottoman Sultan Ahmet III (r. 1703‚Äì1730) decided to declare war on Russia. But Aƒüa Yusuf Pasha persuaded the Sultan to give up the idea believing that Peter the Great would finally follow the terms of the treaty. However, the Russian Tsar was still reluctant, and the angered Sultan dismissed Aƒüa Yusuf Pasha from his post as grand vizier on 11 November 1712.

Located in the center of the city of Goris, it houses an impressive collection of over 5,000 ethnographic and archaeological objects that tell the story of the region's rich cultural heritage, history, and traditions.  History  alt=Originally located in an abandoned church, the Local Lore Museum of Goris opened in 1948 as the first museum in Syunik. The museum was closed in 1988 to safeguard the collection during the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict, and it remained closed until 2001 when it was relocated and reopened. The museum is now located in the center of Goris, just off the main Square. Visitors can identify the Museum by the stone sculptures and khachkars sitting outside.  Collections  Five-faced idol, 2nd millennium B.C., Harzhis village The museum shares rich history of Goris, which historically, from ancient times to the modern day, has been a thriving center of the Syunik region. Goris has a long history of stone carving and metal working. The museum has more than 5,000 objects in its collection, of which 400-500 are on display, to illustrate both of these cultural traditions. The collection includes objects from materials from the Soviet-Armenian period, as well as objects from the Early Bronze Age to the present. The museum collections include beautifully designed weapons, ornaments, belts, ceramics, bronze and beaded jewelry, some with semi-precious stones, and ethnographic objects that speak to a long history of cultural activity. Many objects were excavated near the museum. Of particular significance is the five-faced idol, which dates back to the 2nd millennium B.C. It is a special pre-Christian object that demonstrates a unique type of imagery. It was found between Tatev and Goris (Harzhis village), and its excavation suggested the location of a pagan temple that existed there previously. Another significant work exhibited at the Museum is the bronze lion from the 7th century B.C. (the Urartian period), symbolic of the Urartian kings.

While not a tourist destination, local shepherds took their herds to graze deep in the Gorges du Bonnant where there was a hot spring that ensured the surrounding vegetation flourished earlier than in other parts of the area. In 1806, the notary Joseph-Marie Gontard commissioned scientists to analyse the spring water. Thrilled with the results, he bought all the land that the spring flowed through. That same year, he had a gallery dug out over the springs where he set up four wooden tubs and opened the very first thermal baths of Saint-Gervais.Les Bains du Mont Blanc In 1807, he raised the building with an extra storey and added two turrets.  The early years: intuition and success (1806‚Äì1838)  From 1806, the thermal baths of Saint-Gervais met with instant success . The site evolved into a prestigious hotel for tourists heading on to Chamonix, hikers setting off for the Mont Blanc Tour and travellers visiting the Alps. Over a thirty-year period, Joseph-Marie Gontard extended, refurbished and transformed the site, taking on a range of roles from wellness centre manager to hotel owner. Up until 1815, the establishment offered evidence-based treatment for patients suffering from a range of different illnesses: rheumatic diseases, neuralgia, epilepsy, scurvy, uterine disorders, etc. Gravure des thermes de Saint-Gervais au XIXe si√®cle  Doctor Matthey proves the water's effectiveness on the skin (1815)  In 1815, Geneva-based doctor Matthey was appointed \\"Inspecting doctor of Saint-Gervais\\". He monitored clients' progress, catalogued the illnesses and diseases for which the water proved effective and developed indications for its use: drinking the water, using it in baths, showers, and steam baths . He was the first to notice its immense benefits on the skin: Pityriasis alba, eczema, ulcers. The Saint-Gervais baths now had a specific area of expertise. The baths enjoyed ever-growing popularity until 1838.  The baths under Dr de Mey (1838‚Äì1870)  In 1838, Joseph-Marie Gontard's establishment was thriving, and he sold the site on to a Belgian doctor, Dr Aloysius-Fran√ßois de Mey. Dr de Mey continued developing the baths, and quickly began renovations and projects to consolidate the baths' fragile under-structures, replacing the old, traditional materials with granite and opening two new extra wings. In 1860, capacity had increased to allow a total of 400 clients to stay at the baths and the establishment was a regional success story. But although the facilities were popular, the tightly controlled atmosphere that reigned over the establishment wasn't to everyone's taste . When Savoie was annexed to France in 1860, the region's tourism industry flourished. That same year, the thermal baths of Saint-Gervais began being overseen by the 'permanent mineral water commission' of the Imperial Academy of Medicine'. Up until the end of the 19th century, there were no further developments in how the water was used, except in treatments for young children.  Management issues and a rebirth (1870‚Äì1892)  After Dr de Mey's death in 1870, the establishment floundered for 13 years. As stipulated in the doctor's will, the baths were passed on to his 13-year-old nephew, a student of the Dominican Order. Ill- equipped to manage a business of this scale, the Dominican Order took control of the establishment with disastrous results. The baths' reputation dwindled and the establishment began to decline. In 1883, it was bought by the Compagnie g√©n√©rale des eaux min√©rales et de bains de mer[Compagnie g√©n√©rale des eaux min√©rales et de bains de mer https://francearchives.fr/facomponent/3e2ad9fd47090c080b652589ac32628c07c7e50a], a financially stable company that already owned seven baths and enjoyed significant expertise in the field. This proved to be a turning point. More targeted treatments were developed, better adapted to patients' illnesses. Hydrotherapy began being used alongside a host of innovations: pulverisations, compresses and the use of nitrogen . Parallel to this, medical inspector Dr Deligny began promoting the benefits of spring water in treatments for children. Thanks to advances in medicine in the second half of the 19th centurymedicine in the second half of the 19th century and doctors' research into thermal/spring therapiesthermal/spring therapies, the baths were reborn: the future looked bright. = Natural catastrophe strikes on 11 July 1892 = 270px On the night of to , the Montjoie Valley was hit by an unforeseen natural catastrophe. At around one o'clock in the morning, a torrent of icy mud and rock swept down the mountain to the Arve plain. The hamlets of Saint- Gervais were significantly damaged and the baths were almost entirely destroyed. Over 75 victims were impacted by the incident . On the morning of 12 July, the entire valley was in shock . = The new post-catastrophe establishment (1894‚Äì1914) = On 14 July 1892, three Chamonix guides followed the course of the avalanche up to 3,310 meters to find out what had triggered the event. Around 200,000 cubic metres of water had accumulated at the T√™te Rousse glacier before exploding under the pressure and rushing down towards the Montjoie Valley . After being probed and tested, the small glacier was put under high-level surveillance. The water and forest authorities began extensive works to drain the water and the springs were unblocked in November. The Compagnie g√©n√©rale des eaux min√©rales et de bains de mer undertook work alongside this to rebuild the baths as quickly as possible, a kilometre downstream from the site of the original baths. In 1894, the new baths were opened, complete with modern architecture and cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of the latest technical advances. This time around, the emphasis was on hydrotherapy: steam booths, nose and throat baths, pulverisation draining, ascending showers, etc. The establishment was also equipped with new medical and hospitality departments. From 1895, thanks to the arrival of the railway line and the Mont Blanc tram, and new hotels and villas popping up across the region, Saint-Gervais entered its golden age and became a holiday destination in its own right.  The downfall of the new baths (1918‚Äì1930)  World War I slammed the brakes on further development. In the aftermath of the war, the baths struggled to pick up where they had left off. Visitor numbers plummeted over the ensuing decade. Several different factors explain why clients stopped coming: competition from the √âvian baths and a decrease in the water's effectiveness at the new 1894 establishment, due to the hurried pace at which work had been carried out. Nobody had considered that the faster flow of the springs since the natural catastrophe meant that the mineral profile of the water had been altered, and that the 800 metres of copper piping meant the water was significantly cooler. In December 1925, the Compagnie g√©n√©rale des eaux min√©rales et de bains de mer threw in the towel and sold the establishment to the Soci√©t√© immobili√®re et thermale de Saint-Gervais-les- Bains. In 1925, the company called on shareholders to embark on extensive new renovations: refurbishing the buildings, renovating the piping and treatment infrastructure and creating new leisure facilities: a casino, tennis courts, a theatre, and more. But the company overlooked the root problem: that carrying the water from the spring to the establishment stripped it of most of its healing properties. And visitor numbers failed to pick back up. In 1930, the company filed for bankruptcyfiled for bankruptcy.  A new lease of life after a council buy-out (1930‚Äì1939)  In the summer of 1930, the Saint- Gervais council, business partners and locals rallied together to save the spa resort. The local council bought the entire site and appointed doctors Desaux and Paillet as its managersdoctors Desaux and Paillet. The establishment built in the wake of the 1892 catastrophe was abandoned and treatment was once again provided at the site of the springs themselves, this time analysed and better protected . 'Children's hubs' were set up in Saint-Gervais villageSaint- Gervais village in 1922. The baths had been brought back to life, but the council didn't have the financial means to support new development projects, and World War II erupted in 1939.  Hard times (1939‚Äì1958)  During the war, the establishment continued to receive a handful of clients, and was fitted with an alpine infirmary and medical centre for soldiers. In the aftermath of World War II, the establishment was in the worst state it had ever been. Faced with financial ruin, in 1946 the Saint-Gervais council decided to sell the site to a ChamonixChamonix hotel owner, Mr Roy. Yet this unscrupulous businessman did not comply with specifications and began embezzling the money that had been intended for renovating the facilities. Over the next 12 years, the plight of the baths steadily worsened.  The Califanos and a spa industry revival (1958‚Äì1980)  Elected in 1953, the ambitious new mayor Maurice MartelMaurice Martel began work on reviving the baths. In 1958, the council spent 20 million Francs on buying back the establishment it had sold 12 years earlier for just 1 million . At the same time, Dr L√©pinay, who had arrived at the spa in 1949, was pursuing his research: in addition to patients suffering from severe eczema, he observed that the Saint-Gervais spring waters had an impact on scar healingscar healing and could be used on patients with severe burnsburns . In 1959, the establishment was handed over to a new manager, Armand Califano and his company Soci√©t√© nouvelle des thermes de Saint-Gervais Le Fayet. It took close to 20 years to get the spa baths back in shape. The treatments' proven effectiveness on severe burns, the management skills of Armand Califano and his wife, and renovations all contributed to restoring the establishment to its former glory. = Janine Charrat's accident (1961) = In 1961, Janine Charrat,Janine Charat a renowned dancer, suffered a serious accident . During a television show, a candle set fire to her tutu and the ensuing burns covered 50% of her body. After receiving life-saving treatment at the Cochin hospital, she stayed at the Saint-Gervais spa baths all year round, and was monitored by Dr L√©pinay. She managed to recover and returned to dancingreturned to dancing in 1964. This success story helped boost the profile of severe burn treatments provided at Saint-Gervais. = The new establishment: spa treatments and wellness (1980‚Äì1997) = Thermes de Saint-Gervais de nuit From 1980, new director Bernard Califano began investigating a new approach: wellness spa treatments. Designed by architect B. Ferrari, a new establishment opened its doors in 1992, with a visitor capacity of 10,000 clients. But from 1993, the company found itself unable to pay off its debts. On 6 April 1994, the Saint- Gervais council decided to set up a semi-public company, with the council holding three quarters of the share capital. Up until 2009, it spent 2 million Francs (‚Ç¨305,000) per year on clearing its debts. In 1996, the National Academy of Medicine listed the water at Saint-Gervais as one of the nine spring waters to have active benefits on skin thanks to its healing, repairing and soothing properties . = Modernisation by Laboratoires Rivadis (1997‚Äì2016) = 250px In 1997, the council sold all its company shares to Laboratoires RivadisLaboratoire Rivadis while retaining ownership of the building and premises. The group began investing in ushering the spa baths into the modern age, creating new stainless steel piping for the spring water network, refurbishing the beauty institute, setting up an internal laboratory for monitoring the facilities' hygiene levels, etc. In 2000, the baths were granted ISO 9001 standard certification. In 2010, Rivadis continued expanding the wellness facilities and opened its very first spring water outdoor pool. In 2012, it launched the Saint-Gervais Mont BlancSaint-Gervais Mont Blanc range of skincare products.  L'Or√©al buys the brand and baths (2016-present)  In 2016, l‚ÄôOr√©al bought outL'Or√©al bought out the Soci√©t√© de gestion des thermes de Saint-Gervais-les-Bains and the trademark licence for the Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc products.

The park contains a statue of a deer by Pierre-Louis Rouillard, an allegorical statue, La Source ou Th√©tis by Louis Sauvageau and a fountain. A repeat of the 1892 disaster would not happen today, because glaciers are regularly monitored and drained if necessary. However, the threat still remains.  Thermal water and its therapeutic qualities  Thermal water from Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc is one of 770 types identified in France . Thanks to thousands of years travelling through the depths of the mountain, the water and its active minerals act on the skin with repairing and soothing effects, in on particular scars and burns. = A 6,500-year passage through Mont Blanc's underground rock = Thermal water derives its properties from its 6,500 years within the tunnels of Mont Blanc. Falling first as rainwater on the mountain, it passes through the tunnels of the Alpine range down to a depth of 3,000 metres, where it circulates at a temperature of 100¬∞C. On its journey, it first crosses the gypsum bedrock, rich in calcium and sulphates, before coming into contact with crystalline and sedimentary rock composed of quartzite, limestone, gypsum and dolomite. Throughout its passage, it is enriched by active minerals before emerging at the Saint-Gervais source, at a temperature of 39¬∞C. = Healing, soothing anti-inflammatory minerals = Saint-Gervais thermal water is up to thirty times richer in minerals than regular mineral water, which gives it anti-inflammatory, healing and soothing properties . Its high sodium, sulphate and chloride content helps maintain cellular homeostasis, or skin balance. Its calcium and magnesium content accelerates the formation of the skin's protective barrier, while strontium helps reduce irritation and itching . Two other components, boron and manganese, respectively boost healing of the skin and its defence against oxidative stress. = A dermatological treatment for scars and burns = This thermal water is used in dermatology to treat chronic dermatitis like in psoriasis and atopy, including in infants. It has also been used to treat burns since the 1950s. \\"For severe burns, Saint-Gervais thermal water-based crenotherapy has produced beneficial results, not only for the after-effects of scarring, but also for residual issues with sensitive skin, such as itching and hyperesthesia\\", according to a 2018 study, Saint-Gervais thermal water, a unique composition, proven dermatological effects . = Recognition by the National Academy of Medicine = Since 1996, the French National Academy of Medicine has recognised the water in Saint-Gervais Mont Blanc as thermal water that actively benefits the skin with its healing, repairing and soothing properties. The academy noted: \\"the water's physical and chemical properties make it suitable for dermatological spa treatment (due to its isotonicity and haemostatic and healing properties), for all dermatological and mucocutaneous conditions and after-effects of burns, accidents and other causes... \\" The appellation awarded by the French National Academy of Medicine is reserved for mineral-rich spring waters boasting therapeutic properties. In France, nine waters have been awarded this label in the dermatology category, with various benefits, linked to the rocks that they come into contact with on their journey. = Clinical studies on the dermatological effects of water = A series of clinical observations were carried out in 2017. The first study was carried out on the water from Saint- Gervais Mont Blanc, on 51 women aged between 23 and 65 on reactive skin (spraying spa water twice a day for four weeks). It clinically proved the healing and soothing properties of thewater: significant fall in itching, rashes, dry skin, tightness and overheating . A second study was carried out to assess the clinical effects of natural spa treatment on 106 treatments (baths, showers, spraying, massages) affected by dermatological conditions (e.g. scarring, eczema, psoriasis). Medical professionals noted an improvement in skin conditions in 100% of cases.

He rowed for his country at the 1950 British Empire Games, and won two national rowing titles. A front-row forward and lock, he played provincial rugby for both and , and was involved in services matches during World War II. He later served as a Blenheim borough councillor. Early life and family Born in Marton on 29 July 1915, Hegglun was the son of Edward Tristan Hegglun and Gertrude Lilian Hegglun (n√©e Gomez). He was educated at Marlborough College in Blenheim. In 1945, he married Patricia Mary Meachen, daughter of the member of Parliament for Marlborough and later mayor of Blenheim, Ted Meachen. The couple went on to have seven children, including Marilen Hegglun who won several national rowing titles, and was one of the first women to represent New Zealand in rowing internationally. Another of their children, Richard Hegglun, played for the Marlborough rugby side during their 1973‚Äì1974 Ranfurly Shield tenure, and Richard's son, Greg Hegglun, played first-class cricket for Central Districts. Sporting career =Rowing= Hugglun was a member of the Wellington Rowing Club before World War II, but he is more closely associated with the Wairau Rowing Club in Marlborough. He won two New Zealand national rowing championship titles representing Wairau: the single scull in 1949, and as a member of the men's coxed four crew in 1954. At the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, Hegglun, as reigning national champion, represented New Zealand in the single scull, finishing in fourth place. In later years, Hegglun was one of the driving forces behind the development of Lake Ruataniwha as a rowing venue. As a national champion, Hegglun was accorded life membership of the Wairau Rowing Club, but in 2010, as part of the club's centennial celebrations, he was also posthumously awarded life membership in recognition of his service to the club. =Rugby union= Playing for the Poneke club, Hegglun was first selected as a middle-row forward (in a 3‚Äì4‚Äì1 scrum formation) in the provincial rugby team that played in 1938. Later that season, he played in the front row against . In Wellington's match against in 1940, Hegglun scored a try under the posts in his side's 8‚Äì3 victory at Athletic Park. In July 1945, Hegglun was a member of the side that defeated to lift the Seddon Shield. When Marlborough successfully defended the shield against Golden Bay-Motueka the following month, by 24 points to 3, Hegglun's forward play was described as \\"outstanding\\". In 1946, Hegglun was named as a front-row forward in the South Island team to play the North Island; the rain- shortened match, played at Athletic Park, Wellington, was won by the North 8‚Äì3. Later that year, he played at lock for a combined Seddon Shields Districts side against the touring Australian national team, scoring a try as the Australians won a close match 15‚Äì12. Hegglun continued to play a prominent role in the Marlborough side until at least 1949. Military service Before World War II, Hegglun worked as a builder and bridge constructor. He enlisted as a private in the Infantry Reinforcements, 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), Third Echelon. In February 1943, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the New Zealand Infantry, and that year, on 3 December, he was wounded in action. While serving in the Middle East, Hegglun took part in services rugby matches, representing 2NZEF, including against a British Combined Services team and an Australian Imperial Force side in December 1941, He also played a prominent part in the inaugural rowing regatta in 1942 between New Zealand forces and the Cairo River Club for the Freyberg Cup, held on the Nile. The trophy was won by the New Zealanders, with Hegglun winning the single scull, being a member of the crew that won the coxless four, and stroking the New Zealand Division pair that finished third. In 1943, Hegglun won the single scull in the Cairo championships, defeating the Egyptian champion in the process. Hegglun also showed some talent as a boxer, contesting the heavyweight class in the New Zealand divisional boxing championships in Syria in 1942, where he was knocked out in the semi-final. Following the war, Hegglun remained active in the military, serving in the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment Territorial Force, rising to the rank of colonel. He was commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Nelson‚ÄìMarlborough‚ÄìWest Coast Regiment, between 1959 and 1961, and deputy commander of the Southern Military District from 1961 to 1967. In the 1967 Queen‚Äôs Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire. Later life and death Hegglun worked as an overseer for the Blenheim Borough Council. Active in community affairs, he served as a Blenheim borough councillor, and as the Marlborough regional civil defence officer. Hegglun died on 22 July 1983, and was buried at Fairhall Cemetery.

It is inspired by baseball jackets, and it uses embroidery, silk and Japanese influences.  History  After the end of the Second World War, the remnants of the parachute capes were used by the American soldiers to create light jackets similar to teddy and varsity jackets and others inspired by the American universities. Upon leaving, they were decorated with motifs coming from the military inspiration, and then diversified with a m√©lange of Japanese and American culture, approximating the style to the tattoo technique. A little after, the sukaman (portmanteau of Yokosuka-Mambo) fashion movement retook certain elements of civil style with military style of the military base of Yokosuka: the youths of this movement had one-button suits made by local tailors and sometimes went so far as to imitating American haircuts. They particularly appreciated souvenir jackets and gave them the name sukajan (from \\"Yokosuka jumpers\\"). This type of jacket ended up being marketed in the Yokosuka boutiques, for the passing sailors. The film Pigs and Battleships popularized the sukajan in the entire country and these jackets became the Japanese equivalent of greaser fashion for the \\"bad boys\\". Afterwards, this type of jacket was transformed into a local classic: a souvenir object for tourists or a basic wardrobe element. In the 2010s, it was reinterpreted by fashion and various European designers who seized it to integrate it into their ready-to-wear collections. Sometimes close to the silk bombers, adorned with tiger, snake or dragon motifs, the jacket paradoxically keeps the (visual) softness of the silk against the virile image of those who wear them. is another kind of sukajan, based on a military jacket such as the MA-1.Vietjan is adorned with maps of Vietnam as well as other motifs.

Plot  Under the guise of a photojournalist sympathetic towards Salafi jihadism, Talal Derki is allowed to enter a village controlled by the al-Nusra Front close to the front line of the Syrian Civil War, and stays with the Osama family. The family patriarch Abu Osama is an enthusiastic fanatic, openly praising the September 11 attacks and naming his children after the leaders of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. He works as a sniper and as a mine remover, and removes his children from school due to coeducation. The children, in particular the eldest son Osama, become increasingly prone to fighting and bullying. During a mission, Abu Osama's left lower leg is blown off by a mine. Shortly afterwards, the children are sent to a terrorist training camp. The boys face harsh conditions, and quickly become homesick. After returning home, Abu Osama's treasured books are destroyed in an airstrike by the Russian Air Force, and he lives by selling components from disarmed mines to bombmakers. He remains committed to his belief that the war will lead to an apocalyptic Third World War between a revived Caliphate and the Christian world and bring on the victory of the Mahdi against the Antichrist. At the camp, Osama advances along and is prepared for further military training, while his younger brother Ayman does not do well and wants to return to school. Abu Osama takes the decisive step of teaching Osama how to shoot a gun. Before Osama leaves for a more intensive camp, he shares a riddle with Ayman. Osama undergoes three years of training and indoctrination, while Ayman returns to school. As Osama's brigade is driven to the front for the first time and as Talal leaves to return home to Berlin, he explains that Ayman and Osama continued down their separate paths into their teenage years, and reflects upon the deep devastation of Syria.

The atlas was ascribed to Nicolas Vallard. However, there is a degree of uncertainty over his authorship. Nowadays, it is believed that the Vallard Atlas was developed from an earlier Portuguese prototype.  History  The Vallard Atlas is one of the most renowned atlases of the 16th century. It is an example of work from the Dieppe School of Cartography. Several doubts were raised about the authorship of the atlas; it was generally assumed that Nicolas Vallard was only the first owner of the atlas.[1]\\"L'√©nigme de l'atlas dieppois\\", Gilles Lapouge, p. 104 √† 111, GEOHISTOIRE n¬∞ 2, april-mai 2012. Credit for the work was given to an anonymus Portuguese cartographer. The atlas showed for the first time the east coast of Australia. Interestingly, the markings on the map were made 200 years before Captain James Cook discovered the continent. Thus, the atlas could prove that the attribution of the discovery of the Australian East Coast to James Cook was a mistake.[2]K.G. McIntyre (1977), The Secret Discovery of Australia; Portuguese discoveries 200 years before Captain Cook. (Souvenir Press, Medindie, South Australia. )[3]Trickett, P. (2007), Beyond Capricorn: How Portuguese adventurers discovered and mapped Australia and New Zealand 250 years before Captain Cook. (East St. Publications. Adelaide. ) However, the theory that this proves that the Portuguese made contact with Australia is contested. Since 1924, the original atlas can be found in the Huntington Library in San Marino (California) in the USA.  Description  The atlas consists of 68 pages, which include a calendar and 15 nautical charts with illustrations, as well as detailed maritime information. It contains illustrations of the indigenous population of the New World and is therefore an important testimony to colonisation. The original atlas was bound in red leather with gold decorations in 1805. An unusual feature of the work lies in the fact that the map reverses the common orientation of the world, with the south at the top.[4]\\"Atlas Vallard, Study Book\\", Lu√≠s Filipe F.R. Thomaz, D.

It is a prostrate or low spreading shrub with simple or three-part leaves and white or pale pink four-petalled flowers.Boronia nana var. pubescens Description Boronia nana is a prostrate shrub or one that has weak, spreading branches and grows to about wide and high. Its youngest branches have a few soft hairs but become glabrous as they age. The leaves are simple or trifoliate on a petiole up to long. The leaves or leaflets are linear to elliptic or egg-shaped, long and wide. The flowers are white to pale pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to three or more in leaf axils, the groups on a peduncle long, individual flowers on a pedicel . The four sepals are triangular to broadly egg-shaped, long and wide, overlapping at their bases. The four petals are long, wide and overlap at their bases. The stamens are covered with long, soft hairs. Flowering occurs from October to February. Taxonomy and naming Boronia nana was first formally described in 1840 by William Jackson Hooker who published the description in Icones Plantarum from a specimen collected by Ronald Campbell Gunn on top of Rocky Cape. The names of three varieties have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Boronia nana var. hyssopifolia has simple leaves; * Boronia nana var. nana has mostly trifoliate leaves, mostly glabrous leaves, sepals and petals; * Boronia nana var. pubescens has mostly trifoliate leaves with short, soft hairs.

After the end of the German occupation in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (January 19, 1945), a camp for German POW's was set up around March-April 1945, in the stalag barracks, which operated until around 1948.

Escapes  The first attempt to escape likely took place at the turn of 1941/1942. Its first stage lasted from December 1941 to January 1942. At that time, a group of prisoners made a pit under an uninhabited block No. 14, standing at the northern fence of the camp, to a small forest outside the stalagium located at a distance of about 25 m. The escape was to take place in the spring of 1942. Due to the shallowness of the excavation, during the spring thaw, the guard made a raid in him. The Germans found in him the things of one of the prisoners, and this allowed them to reach the organizers, including Yuriy Curkan (), who had been imprisoned in the Stalag since October 29, 1941. All of the organizers were first imprisoned and subjected to brutal interrogation, and then transported to Stalag Luft VI in Heidekrug in East Prussia, near the former Polish-Lithuanian border. In 1967, Curkan published his memoirs, which included his stay at Stalag Luft II.J. Curkan, –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –∫—Ä—É–≥ –ê–¥–∞ (The last circle of Ada).

On October 9, 1942, the successful escape of two aviation officers, Aleksander Kuzniecow and Arkady Vorozcow, took place. They escaped while working in one of the factories in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. By coincidence, they came across communists from the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Polish Workers' Party (PWP), who took care of them. While remaining in hiding, they joined the conspiratorial work, beginning by editing \\"Peperian\\" newspapers based on Russian radio listening. After a few months, Kuznetsov, threatened with arrest, was included in the first ≈Å√≥d≈∫ partisan detachment People's Guard, known today as the \\"Radiant\\". With him he took part in the skirmish at G≈Çownem on May 8, 1943, which ended with the division of the unit. He survived thanks to the help of the inhabitants of the village Stary Waliszew. Later, with the help of Warsaw communists, he came to Warsaw and from there to partisan units in the Lublin region, where he saw the entrance of the Red Army. Vorozcow was arrested in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ at the end of April 1943. After many months of investigation, he was sent to Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where he received the number 188 052. In July 1944 he was deported to a transport of 400 passengers to KL Mauthausen-Gusen k. Linz in Austria and there he survived until the liberation of the camp on May 5, 1945.

Here, too, there are materials collected during the investigation. However, they have a historical rather than a procedural character. The first investigation of Stalag Luft II were carried out in April 1948. Eight people were interrogated at that time.

Actions taken in this case in January 1989 by the District Committee No. 20 \\"Odrza≈Ñska\\" (St. Dubois 10 St.), with the approval of the Voivodship Civil Committee for the Protection of the Memory of Struggle and Martyrdom,State Archives in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, files of the Voivodship Citizens' Protection Committee Monuments of Struggle and Martyrdom in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. have not been realized. At the beginning of 2014, another attempt was made to commemorate this place, this time by the Civic Committee for Commemoration of the Camp, chosen from the Society of Friends of Rudy Pabianicka and from the Society of Rudy Pabianicka Sympathizers, aimed at setting the corner at ul. Odrza≈Ñska and Zuch√≥w stone with an appropriate memorial and information board. The coordinator of the initial organizational activities was the Department of the History of Occupation in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ District , which for years has been collecting all historical information about this camp. In the collection of the Lodz there is a reconstruction of the camp plan made in 1961 by a resident of this area Museum of Independence Traditions in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, reference number A ‚Äì 3973. and wooden decorative plate signed \\"Stalag Luft 2 ‚Äì Litzmannstadt ‚Äì 1942\\"Museum of Independence Traditions in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, reference number M ‚Äì 1340.. In addition, in the collection of World War II Department of this museum there are unregistered materials regarding Sasha Kuznetsov (mainly scans of his occupation documents and photos).

Suppose we have to allocate some items among people. Each person can rank the items from best to worst. The RM rule says that we have to give as many people as possible their best (#1) item. Subject to that, we have to give as many people as possible their next-best (#2) item, and so on. In the special case in which each person should receive a single item (for example, when the \\"items\\" are tasks and each task has to be done by a single person), the problem is called rank-maximal matching or greedy matching. The idea is similar to that of utilitarian cake-cutting, where the goal is to maximize the sum of utilities of all participants. However, the utilitarian rule works with cardinal (numeric) utility functions, while the RM rule works with ordinal utilities (rankings).  Definition  There are several items and several agents. Each agent has a total order on the items. Agents can be indifferent between some items; for each agent, we can partition the items to equivalence classes that contain items of the same rank. For example, If Alice's preference-relation is x > y,z > w, it means that Alice's 1st choice is x, which is better for her than all other items; Alice's 2nd choice is y and z, which are equally good in her eyes but not as good as x; and Alice's 3rd choice is w, which she considers worse than all other items. For every allocation of items to the agents, we construct its rank-vector as follows. Element #1 in the vector is the total number of items that are 1st-choice for their owners; Element #2 is the total number of items that are 2nd-choice for their owners; and so on. A rank-maximal allocation is one in which the rank- vector is maximum (in lexicographic order).  Example  Three items, x y and z, have to be divided among three agents whose rankings are: * Alice: x > y > z * Bob: x > y > z * Carl: y > x > z In the allocation (x, y, z), Alice gets are 1st choice (x), Bob gets his 2nd choice (y), and Carl gets his 3rd choice (z). The rank-vector is thus (1,1,1). In the allocation (x,z,y), both Alice and Carl get their 1st choice and Bob gets his 3rd choice. The rank-vector is thus (2,0,1), which is lexicographically higher than (1,1,1) ‚Äì it gives more people their 1st choice. It is easy to check that no allocation produces a lexicographically-higher rank-vector. Hence, the allocation (x,z,y) is rank- maximal. Similarly, the allocation (z,x,y) is rank-maximal ‚Äì it produces the same rank-vector (2,0,1).  Algorithms  RM matchings were first studied by Robert Irving, who called them greedy matchings. He presented an algorithm that finds an RM matching in time O(n^2 c^3), where n is the number of agents and c is the largest length of a preference-list of an agent. Later, an improved algorithm was found, which runs in time O(m\\\\cdot \\\\min(n, C\\\\sqrt{n})), where m is the total length of all preference-lists (total number of edges in the graph), and C is the maximal rank of an item used in an RM matching (i.e., the maximal number of non-zero elements in an optimal rank vector). A different solution, using maximum-weight matchings, attains a similar run-time - O(m\\\\cdot \\\\min(n+C, C\\\\sqrt{n})).  Variants  The problem has several variants. 1\\\\. In maximum-cardinality RM matching, the goal is to find, among all different RM matchings, the one with the maximum number of matchings. 2\\\\. In fair matching, the goal is to find a maximum-cardinality matching such that the minimum number of edges of rank r are used, given that - the minimum number of edges of rank r‚àí1 are used, and so on. Both maximum-cardinality RM matching and fair matching can be found by reduction to maximum-weight matching. 3\\\\. In the capacitated RM matching problem, each agent has an upper capacity denoting an upper bound on the total number of items he should get. Each item has an upper quota denoting an upper bound on the number of different agents it can be allocated to. It was first studied by Melhorn and Michail, who gave an algorithm with run-time O(C n m \\\\log(n^2/m)\\\\log(n)). There is an improved algorithm with run-time O(m\\\\cdot \\\\min(B, C \\\\sqrt{B})), where B is the minimum of the sum-of-quotas of the agents and the sum-of- quotas of the items. It is based on an extension of the Gallai‚ÄìEdmonds decomposition to multi-edge matchings.

Translated as \\"Health Is within You!\\" or \\"Salvation Is within You!\\", its anonymous authors believed that committed, amateur revolutionaries would be able to build explosives by following simple directions. It advocated for workers to lose their despair and partake in individual, revolutionary acts. Its contents included a glossary, basic chemistry training, and safety procedures. The Italian- language handbook was likely authored by Ettore Molinari, a chemist, anarchist, and friend of Galleani. Its contents were not novel, but otherwise available in encyclopedias, applied chemistry books, and industrial sources. It was first advertised in Galleani's Cronaca Sovversiva anarchist newspaper, read by his American followers, in 1906. Police and historians would use the handbook to profile anarchists and imply guilt by possession. A decade after its release, La Salute √® in voi figured prominently in the prosecution of the 1915 Bresci Circle failed bombing of New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral, in which the case revolved around the anarchists' right to read. Ultimately, the perpetrators of successful political bombings from this era had backgrounds in explosives from their occupation, and the idea of amateurs learning to make bombs from simple instructions was impractical.  Contents  The how-to handbook and anarchist manifesto encouraged workers to forgo their anguish, which only furthered their impoverishment, and instead commit to revolutionary acts. It wrote that workers could not foment revolution without the technical means. Thus, La Salute √® in voi gave readers plain directions for producing explosives. Chapters include \\"Explosive Material\\", \\"Nitroglycerin\\", \\"Capsule and Petard\\", \\"Dynamite\\", \\"Fulminate of Mercury\\", and \\"Preparation of Fuses\\". Its opening appeals to collective gain from individual action, with the example of an Italian town in 1890 where rice laborers went on strike for wages. At their march to city hall, one hit a guard with a rock and the police fired on the crowd, killing three workers and wounding more, but ultimately getting the laborers their raise by dint of those martyred. The handbook's chemistry training includes using a Baum√© scale to measure liquid density and determine the potency of compounds. It also included safety procedure (e.g., if a reader drank nitric acid) and a glossary of terms and definitions, akin to a textbook. The handbook treated its measurements like a farmer's almanac by giving potential household uses for chemicals alongside their density information.  Publication  The 48-page La Salute √® in voi was written for those who lacked expertise in chemistry and engineering. Like John Most's Revolution√§re Kriegswissenschaft, the handbook wanted to make military technology accessible to common people. And it did, to textile workers and anarchist writers of the eastern United States, inspired by other bombings but otherwise lacking occupational access to dynamite and the practical expertise to bomb-making. While its detail to chemical handling technique elevated the handbook from mere anarchist manifesto, none of its contents were new. Its simple information was available in normal encyclopedias, applied chemistry books, and industrial sources, such as the Martin Eissler's 1897 standard manual on explosives. La Salute √® in voi did not contain complex formula or time detonator instructions. La Salute √® in voi was written anonymously. Its authors called themselves \\"the compilers\\" and showed a working familiarity with basic chemistry. This emphasis on science separated La Salute √® in voi from other manifestos and is likely owed to Ettore Molinari, a chemist and anarchist believed to have drafted an early version of the handbook, if not the full book. In Paris, Molinari had met the Italian anarchist Luigi Galleani, whose Italian-language anarchist newspaper, Cronaca Sovversiva (Subversion Chronicle), first advertised La Salute √® in voi for sale in 1906 in the United States, where his followers‚Äîthe Galleanisti‚Äîwould have read it. The handbook's title, which translates to \\"Health Is within You!\\" or \\"Salvation Is within You!\\", potentially refers to Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy, whose The Kingdom of God Is Within You shares its Italian title with the bomb-making handbook. Contrarily, Tolstoy favored passive resistance and considered violence incompatible with Christian morality. The printing contains a prominent typographical error in which an \\"i\\", displayed as \\"1\\", would severely undercut the proportion of sulfuric acid in the nitroglycerin formula. Cronaca Sovversiva later ran a correction. While some historians surmised that this error led to errant explosions, realistically, the incorrect formula would have produced a mess of acids rather than the much more volatile nitroglycerin.  Application  The police used the handbook to profile anarchist attackers, and historians used the handbook as proof of Galleanist responsibility for crimes. La Salute √® in voi had a low profile for the nine years prior to the 1915 Bresci Circle failed bombing of New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral. Though the handbook was never mentioned by name, it figured prominently in the prosecution of the Bresci Circle members, where the prosecution used it to vilify the defendants despite no proof of its connection to the crime. (Though during and prior to arraignment one of the anarchists had credited the handbook with deranging him, the failed bomb components approximated that of a firework, not of one of the handbook's design.) The police insinuated possession of the handbook as evidence of the defendants' technical expertise and bad intentions, and La Salute √® in voi was the most sensational of the prosecution's seditious books used to show the anarchists' intents. The anarchists' legal defense revolved around their right to read any books of any kind, including bomb-making handbooks. They were ultimately found guilty. The case rekindled fear of easily accessible bomb-making instructions and sensationalism around anarchism. While the handbook's authors believed that amateurs would be able to build explosives by following simple directions, in actuality, the era's successful perpetrators of political bombings had backgrounds in explosives from their respective industries. Workers in industries such as agriculture, construction, and mining had their own means for learning to make bombs or steal dynamite. Literature professor Ann Larabee wrote that the idea that untrained laborers could create bombs at home was and remains impractical, no more than an intellectual exercise. The book did contain elements for neophytes, such as safety procedure and household uses for chemicals, which could double as cover stories and enhanced the handbook's subversiveness. There is no evidence that Galleanists relied on La Salute √® in voi, but if they did, the fact that their bombs hit only themselves, bystanders, and never their intended capitalist and government targets would indicate that the handbook provided insufficient preparation for an attack. When Sacco and Vanzetti were denied appeal and condemned to death, they ended their message to supporters with \\"La Salute √® in voi\\". Its invocation represented a power through threat of violence. Though there is no direct evidence that they had or used a copy, especially as a bomb was not involved in their case, detectives and historians have thought of the handbook as evidence of Galleanist conspiracy, such as when J. Edgar Hoover pursued a copy of the handbook when investigating the Wall Street bombing. After Sacco and Vanzetti, La Salute √® in voi disappeared from public view, owing partially to its limited accessibility, based on its Italian language requirement, and limited topical interest. A 1979 presentation at the Boston Public Library's Sacco and Vanzetti conference renewed interest in the booklet.

Forensics searched the couple's villa and car, finding a small amount of blood. Police found Aini watching television, she did not seem shocked when police notified her that her husband's body had been found. Aini confessed to organizing the murder and hiring her maid's boyfriend Adrianus Ngongo to murder Ellis. She claimed that he was killed because he kept her in a state of poverty and refused to give her more than a $19 per month allowance. She also claimed that he had cheated on her and withheld sex. Police arrested Adrianus Ngongo, who was carrying his share of the $A14,000 Aini had paid him and four accomplices for the murder. Police also arrested two maids who had kept the family's pet dogs quiet during the murder, before helping to clean up and move the body. Aini was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Of the five men hired to commit the murder, three received 12-year prison sentences, and two received 15-year prison sentences.

The technical definition of \\"Earth's crust\\" varies among authors, and the actual numbers also vary significantly.  History  In the 1930s, USSR geochemist Alexander Fersman defined the relative abundance of chemical elements in geological objects, denoted in percents, as . This was in honor to the American geochemist Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, who pioneered in estimating the chemical composition of Earth's crust, based on Clarke and colleague's extensive chemical analysis of numerous rock samples, throughout 1889 to 1924(). Examples based on Fersman's definition: * : When the whole mass of a planet X is Mx , and the mass of oxygen there is Mo , then the weight clarke of oxygen in planet X is Km=\\\\frac{Mo}{Mx} (dimensionless) * : When the whole count of atoms in a rock Y is Ay , and the atom count of silicon there is As , then silicon's clarke of atom count in rock Y is Ka=\\\\frac{As}{Ay} (dimensionless) * Fersman's \\"clarke of Earth's crust\\" is the Earth's surface including 16km-thick lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. = In Russian = is synonymous to \\"the relative abundance of elements\\" in any object, either in weight ratio or in atomic (number of atoms) ratio, regardless of how \\"Earth's crust\\" is defined, and denotation is not restricted to percents. = In German = = In English = In the English speaking world, the term \\"clarke\\" was not even used in Wells(1937) which introduced Fersman's proposal, nor in later USGS articles such as Fleischer(1953). They used the term \\"relative abundance of the elements\\". Brian Mason also mentioned the term \\"clarke\\" in Mason(1952)(mistakenly attributing it to Vladimir Vernadsky, later corrected to Fersman in Mason(1958)), but the definition slightly differed from Fersman's, limiting it only to the average percentage in Earth's crust, but allowed to exclude hydrosphere and atmosphere. Besides for explaining the term, Mason himself didn't use the term \\"clarke\\". A variant term \\"clarke value\\" is occasionally used (examples:). However, \\"clarke value\\" can have a different meaning, the clarke of concentration (example:). Terms \\"clarke number\\" and \\"Clarke number\\" are found in articles written by Japanese authors (example:). = Usage in Japan = In Japan, \\"clarke\\" is translated as . The word is always added, which happens to make the term appear similar in form with scientific constants such as . The term may have a narrower sense than Fersman's. Several of the following constraints may apply: * Only of Earth's crust * Lithosphere approximated as a 10 mile-deep layer from sea level * Must include all of three layers: lithosphere(93.06%), hydrosphere(0.91%) and atmosphere(0.03%) * Only mass ratio) * Denote in percents) (not in ppm or ppb) * (What the quoter believes to be) data from Clarke&Washington;(1924) Another peculiarity in Japan is the existence of a popular version of data, which was tabulated in reference books such as the annual \\"Chronological Scientific Tables\\" (RCST1939(1938)), the \\"Dictionary of Physics and Chemistry\\" (IDPC(1939)) and other prominent books on geochemistry and chemistry. This version Kimura(1938) was devised by chemist . It was often quoted as The \\"Clarke numbers\\" (unsourced examples:,). The numbers differed from any versions by Clarke / Clarke&Washington; (1889‚Äì1924), or anything listed in foreign (non-Japanese) articles such as the USGS compilation , thus unknown outside of Japan. Yet the numbers were sometimes quoted in English articles without citation (example:). As geological definition of \\"Earth's crust\\" evolved, the \\"10 mile-deep\\" approximation were deemed out-of-date, and some people considered the term \\"clarke number\\" obsolete too. Yet other people may have meant broader senses, not limiting to Earth's crust, leading to confusion. RCST1961(1961) switched their \\"clarke number\\" table from Kimura(1938) to Mason(1958) based, and the label \\"clarke number\\" on table was removed in RCST1963(1962). IDPC(1971) removed the \\"clarke number\\" table which was a Kimura(1938)'s variant. IDPC(1981) said the term is mostly abandoned, and the dictionary entry for \\"clarke number\\" itself was removed from IDPC(1998). So \\"clarke numbers\\" became associated almost solely with Kimura(1938)'s data, but Kimura's name forgotten. Incidentally, in major reference books, there was no data table titled \\"clarke numbers\\" which showed Clarke's original tables. Despite being removed from major reference books, data from Kimura(1938) and phrases such as \\"the Clarke number of iron is 4.70\\", unsourced, continue to circulate, even in the 2010s (example:).  Example data  This section lists only historical data. For recent data, see Abundance of elements in Earth's crust. Technical definition of \\"clarke\\", \\"Earth's crust\\" and \\"lithosphere\\" differ among authors, and the actual numbers vary accordingly, sometimes by several times. Even the same author presents multiple versions, with various estimation parameters or knowledge refinements. Yet they are often quoted without source, rendering the data unverifiable. Clarke & Washington presented estimations of the average composition of outer part of Earth with 4 variants: # 10-mile crust, hydrosphere and atmosphere. # 20-mile crust, hydrosphere and atmosphere. # 10-mile crust, only igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks. (i.e. exclude hydrosphere and atmosphere) # 10-mile crust, only igneous rocks. (i.e. exclude hydrosphere and atmosphere) \\"The earth's crust\\" in Clarke & Washington works can mean two different things: (a) The whole outer part of Earth, ie. lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere; (b) Only the lithosphere, which in their works just meant \\"the rocky crust of the earth\\". \\"Crust\\" here means (b). * Following tables do not cover all elements. Some elements not on the table may have larger abundance.

Clarke assumed that rocks downto 10 miles (approx 16 km) below sea level should be quite similar to rocks on the surface of Earth. He determined a portion consisting of this, the hydrosphere and atmosphere as the outer part of the earth which is directly accessible to our observation, that is in weight percentage ratio of 93.06% lithosphere, 0.91% hydrosphere and 0.03% atmosphere. This portion is about 0.3% of the whole Earth. He calculated the weight percentage of elements in this portion. Thus, in accordance to A.Fersmann[sic]'s proposal, the abundance of elements in this range, denoted in weight percentage, are called clarke numbers.\\" This differs from 's \\"clarke\\", is rather similar to his \\"clarke of Earth's crust\\", but further binding to just one of Clarke's variants through a vague phrase \\"in this range\\". * p365 dictionary entry \\"clarke number\\": Author of this entry is not mentioned.

In 1852, S√©chan and Di√©terle went to Constantinople where they were responsible for carrying out the interior decorations in the Sultan Abdulmejid I palaces. S√©chan unofficially became Di√©terle's \\"stepfather\\". Indeed, he lived in a marriage from 1851 with Ann Nugent Woodger, separated from her husbandAnn Nugent Woodger was born on 24 September 1801 in London and baptized in St Martin-in-the-Fields, City of Westminster, on 12 July 1803. She married Jean Louis Gardie for the first time at St Mary's Church, Putney, London, on 21 January 1819. After her separation from her husband, she lived with Charles S√©chan. However, the notion of effective marriage with Charles S√©chan in the legal framework is not certain. To date, no marriage certificate has confirmed this thesis. The only mention on this subject is in the death certificate of Ann Nugent Woodger in 1871: \\"wife of Mr. S√©chan Charles residing in Paris\\". Except, the death certificate of Charles S√©chan dated 14 September 1874 in the 9th arrondissement of Paris (death certificate n¬∞1131) indicates his status as a single person and not as a widower. His biographer, Adolphe Badin, mentions in the preface of the book Ch. S√©chan d√©corateur de l'Op√©ra, souvenirs d'un homme de th√©√¢tre: Does Adolphe Badin mean by the term \\"companion\\", that of a wife or in a more neutral way, the one who lives in a conjugal relationship with a spouse, without being married to him? Charles S√©chan and Ann Nugent Woodger never married, simply because she was probably not divorced from her British husband. Ann Nugent Woodger died in the middle of the Franco-Prussian war, far from the capital, then besieged and bombarded by the Prussians, on 18 January 1871 at Dol-de-Bretagne where she had been living for some time, at the Grande Maison hotel located on Grande Rue (mentions in death certificate n¬∞15). She was buried on 12 March 1872 at Montmartre Cemetery, 18th arrondissement of Paris, in the S√©chan vault. and mother of √âmilie Louise Honorine Gardie. √âdouard B√©nazet (1801‚Äì1867), a French businessman, fermier des jeux and successor in this capacity to his father Jacques B√©nazet (1778‚Äì1848)In 1836, under the July Monarchy, games were prohibited in France. Jacques B√©nazet (1778‚Äì1848), a financier, owned the Paris games farm and was forced to look for a new place, left for Baden-Baden. He obtained a concession for a casino in Germany in 1838. entrusted S√©chan, Di√©terle and his brother-in-law, Louis Jules Haumont, with the decoration of the four lounges of the casino, nicknamed the \\"Maison de Conversation\\" in Baden-Baden in 1853. Di√©terle was made a chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur on 14 August 1852, before being promoted an officer on 15 July 1867.

He was the President of Chamber at the Imperial Court in Paris and a member of the Municipal Council of Croissy-sur-Seine. With the advent of the French Third Republic in September 1870 and the German invasion, he left Paris for the department of Seine-Inf√©rieure. Three months after the collapse of the Second French Empire, Metzinger died in his residence in Yport on 20 December 1870. stayed in Yport in 1856 at the Tougard Hotel.. Under the charm of the Normandy coast, they returned the following years with a few friends such as Jean-Paul Laurens, Julien Gorgeu (Parisian banker, mayor of Yport) and Alfred Nun√®s (Parisian bank clerk, cousin of the painter Camille Pissarro, mayor of Yport). In 1863, he built the villa \\"Les Charmilles\\" in Yport, while his eldest son Georges Di√©terle, moved to a farm in 1870 in Criquebeuf-en-Caux, \\"La ferme des roses\\". During the Franco- Prussian war, Jules Di√©terle's mother, Marie-Antoinette Terrasson, took refuge in Yport.Mention written in the marriage certificate of Marie-Antoinette Terrasson's second son, Charles √âdouard Di√©terle (Paris 24 September 1807 ‚Äì Paris 25 August 1875) married in second marriage in Paris in the 9th arrondissement of Paris, with Louise Athalie Hermier, on 5 November 1870. During the Siege of Paris the capital was then surrounded by German troops and many inhabitants fled the city. In July 1872, the painter Camille Corot stayed with the Di√©terle family in Yport and Criquebeuf-en-Caux. Upon the death of Di√©terle, the villa in Yport was sold to the landscape painter and portraitist (1854‚Äì1937). In 1876, Di√©terle became a director of the Beauvais Manufactory and then president of the Union centrale des arts d√©coratifs. He resigned in 1882 for health reasons.

Design The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry had the same barrel as the Martini‚ÄìHenry with Henry pattern 7-groove polygonal with ribbed angles & right hand twist rifling. The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry also bore a striking resemblance to the Martini‚ÄìHenry, but internally the two were quite distinct. Both rifles were breech-loading falling block single shot rifles, with a cocking under lever opening the breech of the weapon to load a round into the chamber, but the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry employed a V spring and hammer to strike the firing pin and the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry‚Äôs butt was attached to the receiver by means of an upper and a lower tang instead of a sturdy axial bolt. The most noticeable difference between the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry and the Martini‚ÄìHenry was the former had a thumb operated side lever which allowed the hammer to be cocked without operating the under lever, unlike the Martini‚ÄìHenry. In practice this proved to be a major advantage for the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry over Martini‚ÄìHenry, as the former could be carried in a saddle bag without risk of it discharging by itself. The greatest advantage of the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry design was it fired the same .577/450 Martini‚ÄìHenry cartridge as the Martini‚ÄìHenry. The Swinburn design was distinct enough from the Martini design to circumvent the Martini patent that was at the time in force, but in practice the action proved to be more fragile and more prone to stoppages than the Martini action. =Rifle= The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry rifle had a barrel of and weighed , with sights graduated out to . The rifle was typically issued to infantry, it was often supplied with commercially manufactured 1875 Pattern sword bayonets, although Pattern 1871 cutlass bayonets were used with the rifles by naval volunteers. =Carbine= The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry carbine had a barrel of and weighed , with sights graduated out to . The carbine was typically issued to mounted troops and police and some were supplied with a Bowie knife bayonet, although in service these bayonets proved to be ineffectual. History Natal Naval Volunteers parading with their Swinburn‚ÄìHenry rifles and Pattern 1871 cutlass bayonets. The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry was designed by J. S. Swinburn of Swinburn & Son, Birmingham and patented in 1872, all production was carried out by Abingdon Works Co. Ltd., Birmingham. The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry was used extensively by the volunteer forces of the Colony of Natal. It is unknown exactly how many were purchased, but deliveries commenced in 1875 and by 1878 the colony had received 2,040 carbines and 1,150 rifles along with 190 Bowie knife carbine bayonets and an unknown quantity of sword bayonets. The carbines were issued to the mounted units and the rifles to the infantry, the Swinburn‚ÄìHenry was also issued to the Natal Mounted Police and naval volunteers. The Swinburn‚ÄìHenry was used by Natal‚Äôs forces during the Anglo-Zulu War, the carbine in particular saw broad service in the early years of the conflict. Both the rifle and the carbine were eventually replaced by the Martini‚ÄìHenry.

History In 1864 the state legislature provided both funds, and a means for local government to allocate taxes and private donations in order to fund schools for negroes. A public school for African-Americans in Cumberland named Mary Hoye School was run within a colored YMCA on Independence Street. In 1923 a new school was built on Frederick Street to serve the growing population. In 1941 Principal Bracey held an election amongst students and faculty to choose a new name for the school. The choice was made to name the school after inventor and educator George Washington Carver. Since the quality of educational facilities for black children in surrounding areas was inadequate, many African-Americans from surrounding areas in Maryland and West Virginia sent their children to Carver. In 1955 the public schools were integrated. 54 negro children attended the white schools, and in the spring of 1956, Judy Leath, Harold Hilton and William Peck became the first black students to graduate from integrated schools in Allegany County. The school closed in 1959. In 1969, the newly established Allegany Community College renovated the site and used it for 8 years. The Carver Community Center Museum is now located on the site.

It featured a French army commanded by Fran√ßois de Cr√©quy and an Imperial force under Charles V, Duke of Lorraine. While in reality a skirmish, rather than a battle, Ortenbach was part of a series of events that enabled the French to secure Alsace and capture both Kehl and the crossing over the Rhine near the Imperial city of Strasbourg. The war ended in January 1679 when France and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Nijmegen; Strasbourg was annexed by France in 1681. Background Fran√ßois de Cr√©quy, French commander in the Rhineland 1676-1678 In the 1667-1668 War of Devolution, France captured most of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comt√©, before the Triple Alliance of the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden forced them to relinquish most of these gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what Louis XIV viewed as Dutch ingratitude for previous French support, in May 1672 French forces invaded the Dutch Republic. They initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory but by late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they received support from Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and the Spanish Empire. This was formalised by the August 1673 Treaty of the Hague, which opened a new front in the Rhineland; despite being outnumbered, poor co-ordination between the Imperial armies and the skill of Turenne's skill allowed the French to retain the vital territory of Alsace. Turenne's death at Salzbach in 1675 forced the French onto the defensive and in September 1676, the Imperialists regained Philippsburg and control of the Rhine crossing at Strasbourg. During 1677, the new French commander de Cr√©quy prevented them invading Alsace by astute manoeuvring; he won a minor battle at Kochersberg in October and then captured Freiburg im Breisgau. With peace negotiations nearing completion at Nijmegen, Louis planned a rapid campaign in March and April 1678 to strengthen his position in the Spanish Netherlands, remaining on the defensive elsewhere. De Cr√©quy was instructed not to seek battle and ensure the retention of Freiburg; despite his successful defence of Alsace, Louis had limited confidence in him due to his defeat at Konzer Br√ºcke in 1675 and subsequent loss of Trier. While an apparently minor defeat, it clearly rankled, since it was specifically mentioned in the eulogy delivered at Louis' funeral in 1715. In the spring of 1678, de Cr√©quy concentrated his forces at Scherwiller, where he was reinforced by the Army of the Moselle under Schomberg. Charles of Lorraine began assembling an army of 30,000 outside Offenburg, intending to re-capture Freiburg and in late June, de Cr√©quy sought to divert him by moving against Rheinfelden, now in Switzerland. Charles despatched Starhemberg and 7,000 men to its relief but the French caught them crossing the river, inflicting 3,000 casualties, many drowned, and taking 800 prisoners. After this success, Louis gave de Cr√©quy permission to attack the main Imperial force, if he saw an opportunity to do so. De P√©rini, Hard√ø pp.224-225 The battle Marquis de Louvois; the campaign illustrates the benefits provided to French military commanders by his highly efficient logistics support Throughout the war, the logistics support designed by Louvois allowed French armies to move faster and open campaigns much earlier, even during the winter, when armies traditionally halted operations due to lack of forage for cavalry and transport. This was enhanced by a systematic policy of denying supplies to the enemy through blockades and the destruction of towns, villages and farms. On 22 December 1676, Louis ordered the town of Haguenau be razed, (‚Ä¶) leaving no trace or anything that could be used against us.. Their comparative advantage was particularly marked in the Rhineland, due to the weakness of the Imperial system and their armies' dependence on proximity to the Rhine for resupply. In May 1677, the English envoy in Vienna reported Charles of Lorraine was short of ammunition and his troops unable to survive more than three days away from the river. In the 1677 campaign, the Imperialists sustained severe losses from disease and hunger due to the strain placed on their supply lines by constant marching and counter-marching; Freiburg was captured in November because they were incapable of defending it. De Cr√©quy now repeated this strategy; leaving Choiseul at Rheinfelden to reduce the remaining Imperial strongpoints and burn down Bad S√§ckingen, he returned to Bad Krozingen, 15 kilometres south-west of Freiburg. By mid July, most of the Imperial army was spread out between the villages of Gengenbach and Lahr, with forward elements at Denzlingen (see Map). De P√©rini, Hard√ø p. 222 As in the previous year, the Imperial army began to disintegrate due to disease and desertion forcing Charles to withdraw behind the Kinzig, a tributary of the Rhine providing a natural defence barrier in front of Offenburg. On 23 July, the French attempted to cross it but were prevented from doing so by the Imperial cavalry; this is the encounter known as the Battle of Ortenbach. Charles refused to commit his forces to a general engagement and retreated to Oberkirch but at the price of being cut off from the Rhine; on 27 July, de Cr√©quy captured Kehl, its bridge over the Rhine and the associated fort of Etoile. De P√©rini, Hard√ø p. 223 Both the Dutch Republic and Spain had ended the war by mid-August but Emperor Leopold continued to delay in the hope of regaining some of his losses. Charles crossed back onto the left back of the Rhine at Philippsburg but found de Cr√©quy once again blocking his advance. In late September, he admitted defeat and withdrew to the Electoral Palatinate, which ended the campaign. De P√©rini, Hard√ø p. 236 Aftermath In the January 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, France retained Kehl and Freiburg-im-Breisgau; Emperor Leopold then further damaged relationships with his German allies by unsuccessfully demanding he be granted the Free Imperial Cities of Gengenbach, Zell-am-Harmersbach and Offenburg as 'compensation.' As the entry point into Alsace, Louis decided Strasbourg had to be annexed; de Cr√©quy's 1678 campaign allowed him to blockade the city if needed and on 30 September 1681, French troops occupied the city. Lynn,John p. 163. French possession of Strasbourg was confirmed by the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick but in return they withdrew from territories on the right bank of the Rhine, including Kehl and Freiburg.

Around 1952 he joined the Shelby Follin Band, where he met guitarist Paul Burlison. With Burlison, he accompanied Howlin' Wolf on radio performances on station KWEM in West Memphis. He then joined the Snearly Ranch Boys, led by Clyde Leoppard, performing and touring with them, and recorded the single \\"Split Personality\\", released on the Flip label, an offshoot of Sun Records, in early 1955, and credited to Bill Taylor (the band's trumpeter) and Smokey Jo .

He signed to Sun Records, and later in 1955 recorded \\"The Signifying Monkey\\", a song written by Bill Taylor and Stan Kesler based on traditional African American folklore. The record became successful around Memphis, and Baugh, who was assumed by the promoters to be black, was invited to perform at the Apollo Theatre in Harlem. The song formed the basis of Chuck Berry's \\"Jo Jo Gunne\\". Baugh's original recording, featuring a prototype ska rhythm of the type popularized by Millie Small's \\"My Boy Lollipop\\", was reissued in 1964, and the song was recorded about the same time by Sam the Sham.

The two Pok√©mon were first introduced in 2010 and first featured in Pok√©mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions, becoming available for gameplay in Pok√©mon Black and White. Both characters, who bear a resemblance to foxes, were designed by Atsuko Nishida. In Pok√©mon media, Zorua evolves into Zoroark, and both are capable of illusionary abilities. The reception for the two Pok√©mon are relatively mild, with generally favorable fan and critic comments, although the two consistently placed somewhat low in popularity polls. Design and characteristics Zorua is a small, quadrupedal fox with dark grey fur, a black fur ruff around its neck and a red-tipped tuft of fur on its head. Upon evolving into Zoroark, it now sports a larger, bipedal vulpine figure, still with dark grey fur, now gaining a long, red mane ending in a ponytail. In the games, both Pok√©mon are Dark-type and possess the ability \\"Illusion\\" - which allows them to appear as other Pok√©mon or as a human. The in-game description of the two Pok√©mon refers to them as the \\"Tricky Fox\\" (Zorua) and \\"Illusion Fox\\" (Zoroark) Pok√©mon. Both Zorua and Zoroark were designed by Atsuko Nishida, who remarked in an interview that she was inspired to design Zorua as a \\"cheerful-looking\\" fox Pok√©mon after watching the movie Helen the Baby Fox, which had a sad story. As the design for both Pok√©mon were developed, the team preparing a new Pok√©mon movie decided to use Dark-type Pok√©mon as main characters, and found that Zorua and Zoroark worked well with the movie's concept. In the design, Zoroark's mane took the place of an otherwise nonexistent tail.Nintendo Dream, vol. 201 (translation) Appearances =In video games= Zoroark cosplay Zoroark, along with Zorua, was first teased through its silhouette during an airing of the show Pok√©mon Sunday and then revealed through a CoroCoro Comic release in early 2010, becoming the first Pok√©mon revealed for the fifth generation of the Pok√©mon games. An in-game event in Black and White allows the player to use legendary Pok√©mon Raikou, Entei or Suicune in an encounter with a reclusive lady, revealing that the woman was in fact a Zoroark behind illusion, and analogously, Zorua could be obtained through mythical Pok√©mon Celebi. There were no other methods to obtain Zorua or Zoroark in Black or White normally otherwise. Zorua became normally obtainable in the sequels Black 2 and White 2 through gameplay, and by extension Zoroark. Zoroark was also distributed through an event held in 2015 for North American players of Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. Zoroark is also featured in the Super Smash Bros. series as a non-playable, Pok√© Ball character. =In other media= Zorua and Zoroark are main characters in the 2010 movie Pok√©mon: Zoroark: Master of Illusions where Zoroark was the mother of Zorua. In the movie, Zoroark was voiced by Romi Park, while Zorua's Japanese voice was provided by Kurumi Mamiya and the English voice by Eileen Stevens. In the Pok√©mon anime, a Zoroark is part of the team of Ash Ketchum's rival Gladion and battled against Ash's Pikachu at the end of the Sun & Moon series. The Pok√©mon Company designated September 2011 as \\"Zoroark month\\", releasing merchandise of the character and holding in-game distributions of Zoroark. A Zoroark character is also featured multiple times in the variety show Pok√©mon Smash!, which aired on TV Tokyo between 2010 and 2013. Like other Pok√©mon, Zoroark is also featured in the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, and a deck built around a Zoroark card was named by IGN as its top pick for the 2018 championships for the game. =Merchandise= Following the announcement of the new Pok√©mon, Takara Tomy released stuffed toys and vinyl figures of the two characters as part of the movie's merchandising, and also released cooking molds in the shape of Zorua. In 2019, a Zorua plush toy was released as part of a halloween merchandise line. Tokyo's Pok√©mon Caf√© also released a limited-time dish inspired by Zorua during Halloween of 2019. Reception IGN ranked Zoroark #68 in its \\"Top 100 Pok√©mon\\" list, and Japanese fans voted Zoroark to the 56th place of their favorite Pok√©mon in a 2016 official poll, while Zorua placed 147th in the same poll. In a 2016 Anime News Network survey of Japanese fans of \\"most handsome Pok√©mon\\", Zoroark ranked 20th, and ranked the 5th best in the generation in a 2011 poll by the Official Nintendo Magazine. Janine Hawkins of Paste described Zoroark as having a \\"sophisticated skill set that relies on manipulation\\", contrasting it to its werewolf-like design, while referring to Zorua as \\"precious\\". Oliver Cragg of International Business Times UK referred to Zorua as \\"the standard bearer of [the fifth] generation\\", and similarly, Robert Grosso of TechRaptor wrote that Zoroark was \\"the de-facto mascot of Generation 5\\".

She is a clinical psychologist known for her work on heterosexism, sexism, and racism. Greene is the author of close to 100 psychological literature publications. Greene is involved with the Association for Women in Psychology and the Society for the Psychology of Women. Greene is a specialist in the psychology of women and of gender and racial issues in the practice of psychology. She is one of sixteen women to have received the Distinguished Publication Award (DPA) from the Association for Women in Psychology in 2008.  Background  Greene was born in 1950, in East Orange, New Jersey. Greene is the oldest of 4 children. Her parents are Samuel and Thelma Greene. Greene earned her undergraduate degree at New York University in 1973.

Academic career  In 1982, Greene worked in the Inpatient Child Psychiatry Division at Kings County Municipal Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. Many of the clients she served were poor, African American children. The staff was predominantly white. Greene was encouraged by superior staff to advise coworkers how to treat and serve the minority population. Working at the Inpatient Child Psychiatry Division with a female doctor, Dorothy Gartner, sparked her interest in writing and teaching. Currently, she is the author of 11 books, with one as recent as 2013. In 1991, Greene began her career at St. John's University in Queens. She became the first tenured professor that was African American. Along with teaching at St. John's, she has owned her own therapeutic practice since 1984.

Research  Greene has several publications stemmed around lesbian, gay, and bisexual psychology, along with feminism. Her main focus has been on the complexities of the human identity, believing that the framework of a person should not be limited to a strict gender. Greene's advancement in psychology has shown people should not be marginalized based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.

The 15th Indian Census taken in 2011, attempted to estimate the population based on Socio-Economic and Caste Status for the first time since 1931. However, as the enumeration was based on recording the respondents' declaration, it led to creation of hundreds of thousands of caste/subcaste categories. For the 16th Indian census, the government is instead considering enumeration based on a list of OBCs notified by each state. In April 2019, a data user conference was held and it was announced that 330,000 enumerators will be enlisted and that they would be encouraged to use their own smart phones, although a paper option will also be available, which the enumerators will then need to submit electronically. It was further announced that house listing will be conducted between April and September 2020, with actual enumeration in February 2021 and a revision round in March. The reference date will be 1 March 2021 in most of the country and 1 October 2020 for Jammu and Kashmir and some areas of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Caste Enumeration in Census In September 2018, the then Home Minister, Rajnath Singh, announced that the 2021 census will have Other Backward Class (OBC) data, for the first time since the 1931 census. Despite this announcement, the questionnaire presented in July 2019 did not have a specific OBC category. Several state legislative assemblies passed resolutions for collecting OBC data including the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Odisha Legislative Assembly and Bihar Legislative Assembly, while the government of Uttar Pradesh, rejected the opposition's demand to pass such a resolution. On 29 February 2020, central government refused to conduct caste census despite demands from states. Despite Centre's rejection, Maharashtra legislators were adamant for caste based census at least in the state. Protest march in support of OBC census was carried out in Jammu and Kashmir. Minister of State Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale also demanded carrying of census counting every single caste in India.

He was a lecturer at Halle from 1931. In March 1935, he was elected as professor for medieval and modern history at the University of Kiel, but was sent back to Halle in 1936, following a political dispute with the National Socialist press and student organisations in Kiel. He entered military service for two months during 1944, but was discharged due to suffering from depression. He continued to lecture at Halle until 1953, when he once again began to suffer from severe depression following the suicide of a friend and the death of his wife. He committed suicide two years later. Lintzel was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences, the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin and the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities.

On March 4, 2020, McAfee ended his presidential campaign and endorsed Vermin Supreme, and begun running for the 2020 Libertarian Party vice-presidential race. The next day, McAfee tweeted that he was re-entering the 2020 Libertarian presidential primary after none of the other Libertarian candidates would ‚Äúaccept [him] as their VP running mate.‚Äù At the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, McAfee was not nominated for president or vice-president.  Background  McAfee first ran for president in 2016. He was initially the candidate for the Cyber Party, a party which he had created. In December 2015, McAfee re-announced his candidacy under the Libertarian Party. During the campaign, McAfee was considered a front-runner for the nomination, and participated in the first televised Libertarian primary debates. At the convention, McAfee came in third place, with 14.1% of the delegates on the second ballot, behind Austin Petersen and the Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. Following the convention, McAfee declined to endorse the Johnson campaign, and announced that he would not run for office again.  Campaign  Contrary to his assertion at the 2016 convention, McAfee announced on June 3, 2018 via Twitter that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or under the banner of a party of his own creation. On January 22, McAfee announced via Twitter that he would be continuing his campaign \\"in exile\\", following reports that he, his wife, and four of his campaign staff were being indicted for tax-related felonies by the IRS. McAfee indicated that he was in \\"international waters\\", and had previously tweeted that he was on his way to Venezuela. The IRS has not commented on the alleged indictments. On June 29, McAfee tweeted that his campaign headquarters had been relocated to Havana, Cuba. Around the same time, McAfee defended Communist revolutionary Che Guevara on Twitter, putting himself at odds with the Libertarian Party, with Libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas Sarwark saying, \\"I hear very little buzz about McAfee this time around...making a defense of Che Guevara from Cuba may ingratiate him with the Cuban government, but it didn't resonate well with Libertarians.\\" In April, McAfee announced that he would be the running mate of Adam Kokesh, a competitor for the nomination, and also endorsed him for president, though McAfee decided to continue his campaign for the presidency. In May, Jo Jorgensen was nominated at the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, thus suspending McAfee's campaign.

From 1892 to 1903, she was president of the Ligue Fran√ßaise pour le Droit des Femmes, and was also a member of the pacifist association Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise pour l'arbitrage entre nations. As a freemason, she was one of the 17 founders of the Loge du Droit humain (Human Rights Lodge), which was open to both men and women. Biography Born in Honfleur on 15 February 1844, Maria Rengnet was the daughter of Julien Rengnet, a slate mason. Brought up in a well-to-do family, in 1873 she married the architect Raymond Pognon, with whom she had a son and a daughter. Her husband died of typhoid in 1876. In 1880, she moved to Paris where she ran a high-class boarding house. In 1889, after attending the women's rights congress Congr√®s fran√ßais et international du droit des femmes, she became an avid member of the women's movement. From 1892, she was a leading figure in the French League for Women's Rights (Ligue Fran√ßaise pour le Droit des Femmes), becoming president two years later and remaining in the post until 1903. She proved to be an effective leader and public speaker, organizing and presiding the International Feminist Congress (Congr√®s Feministe International) in Paris in both 1882 and 1896 and, together with Marguerite Durand, the 1900 International Congress on the Status and Rights of Women (Congr√®s international de la condition et des droits des femmes), also held in Paris. In 1901, she was one of six women who established the National Council of French Women (Conseil National des Femmes Fran√ßaises). Pognon was also a keen writer, contributing some 70 articles to the women's journal La Fronde between 1897 and 1900. In 1893, she was one of the 17 women who founded the Droit Humain masonic lodge which was open to both men and women members. In 1905, suddenly becoming short of money, she and her daughter Mathilde joined her son in New Caledonia. Two years later, together with her daughter, she moved to Sydney, Australia, where she became active in the local women's organizations. She died in the Sydney suburb Double Bay on 17 April 1925.

History Manatee Memorial Hospital was first proposed in 1939 by the Bradenton Women's Club and other prominent members of the community. Its construction was delayed with the United States' entry into World War II with initial fundraising beginning in 1947. The hospital would open as Manatee Veterans Memorial Hospital on February 23, 1953 with a capacity of 100 beds. The hospital was renamed to its current name on July 1, 1963 to prevent people confusing the hospital as a Veterans Administration facility due to \\"Veterans\\" in its name.

Black, 1994.M.-L., Charue, 1998.) is an anonymous 13th century poem written in Old French in which Gawain is the hero.Ashe, Ilhe, Kalinke, Lacy, Thompson, 1996. The name comes from just one of the adventures Gawain takes part in. Forced to spend the night in a chapel in a cemetery, he encounters a woman who has been cursed and is forced to spend the night with a devil each night. He defeats the devil and liberates her.G. Paris, 1888. The story draws on influences from other Arthurian romances, such as those of Raoul de Houdenc and Chr√©tien de Troyes.  Plot  A knight (later named as Escanor) takes a woman from King Arthur's court and defies any knight to take her back. Kay initially pursues him but is defeated. Gawain is distracted when he goes after him when he sees three women crying. They are lamenting the death of 'Gawain', their story is confirmed by a valet who has had his eyes gouged out. Gawain leaves and, unable to find shelter, takes shelter in a chapel in the middle of a cemetery. It is revealed this is the 'perilous' cemetery. There he meets a woman who has unwittingly done a deal with a devil and, in order to have her released, Gawain battles and kills it. Gawain takes the woman with him in his pursuit of Escanor, who he finds and kills, and takes both women back to the court of King Arthur. He leaves again. In a forest, he meets Raguidel, Espinogre, Cadr√®s and Cadrovain. Cadr√®s is crying because of his love for a woman, but in order to win her, he must defeat twenty knights in battle. They defeat the twenty knights between them. Tristan invites them all to his castle, where Gawain finally learns the truth of his apparent death. Two knights loved two sisters. They, however, professed to love Gawain, despite having never met him. Gomeret and l'Orgueilleux F√©e went in search of Gawain and, finding a knight wearing almost identical armor, killed him. Gawain tracks them down and defeats them both in battle. They return to Arthur's court where several marriages take place.

Biography  Moriguchi was born to a family of growers of mikan growers in Yawatahama in 1898, the oldest of the children of Kenshichi Moriguchi and his wife Suwa. Upon graduating from middle school, he started working in neighboring Uwajima. After several years studying food processing in Uwajima, he emigrated to the United States in 1923. Having settled in Tacoma, Washington, Moriguchi worked by farming and then at a restaurant before moving to Main Fish Company in Seattle where he met Shozo Tsutakawa, father of George Tsutakawa. He soon left Main Fish to found Uwajimaya, which he named for Uwajima, in Tacoma. At first, he sold homemade fishcakes and various cuisines regarding seafood to several Japanese Americans from the back of his truck. Moriguchi's efforts caught the attention of Tsutakawa, who saw Moriguchi as a match for his daughter Sadako. According to family tradition, it was Tsutakawa who arranged the marriage between his daughter and Moriguchi. After being in a relationship for two years, they married in 1932. In 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Moriguchis were moved to Pinedale, California, where their daughter was born, and then to Tule Lake, where the other two children were born. After the war, the family moved to Seattle. There, Moriguchi, with the money he borrowed from friends and former customers of Uwajimaya, bought a small building on South Main Street in Seattle's Japantown where he re- established his business in 1946. In 1962, Uwajimaya made exhibitions by opening their own gift shop at the Century 21 Exposition. That same year in August, Moriguchi died at the age of 64, leaving his business to his four sons, Kenzo, Tomio, Akira, and Toshikatsu.

Presentation, goals and organization The Shift Project is a French nonprofit created in January 2010 in Paris by energy- climate experts such as Jean-Marc Jancovici, Genevi√®ve F√©rone-Creuzet and Michel Lepetit. The organization aims to address two issues raised by the use of carbon: climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels. The Shift works as a think tank that shares ideas with economic, political, academic and voluntary actors. The Shift Project is funded by corporate sponsors. Its budget for 2017 was about 600,000 euros. The organization is led by a group of three people elected by the board of directors, which includes members of the sponsoring companies. A group of experts, called Expert Committee (), ensures the scientific validity of the work done by The Shift Project. This group of experts (in economics, finance, climate, physics, history...) includes Alain Grandjean, Ga√´l Giraud, Herv√© Le Treut, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele and Jacques Treiner. Now headed by Matthieu Auzanneau, The Shift has a team of about ten employees and works with volunteers who are grouped into an independent nonprofit called The Shifters. The Shift examines the dependency of our economy on oil through three angles: the potential return of economic growth, the issues related to the finite amount of oil and, of course, the climate change due to carbon emissions. According to The Shift, although the GDP may have use cases, it is not really useful, especially because it does not consider natural resources (so it does not account for their limited availability) or resulting externalities like greenhouse gas emissions. Projects, events and activities Since 2012, The Shift Project has organized an annual two-day meeting called The Shift Forum with the objective of running a debate between big industrial and financial company leaders and experts on climate, energy and economics. The Shift also organizes many public events, sometimes in collaboration with other organizations like the Business and Climate Summit 2015 or the World Efficiency 2015. The nonprofit also contributed to the National Debate for Energy Transition in France and its president, Jean-Marc Jancovici, is a member of the French Committee on Climate Change. =Main publications= The Shift mostly works in task forces: for a couple of months or years, a group of experts (from higher education and academic research, NGOs, public sector, companies...) is set up on a well- defined question. When the project ends, the task force writes a report and presents it to concerned actors. The report is then made publicly available. Addressed issues include the building rehabilitation to make them more energy- efficient, the relation between energy and GDP, alternative metrics to GDP, the scientific rigor of energy scenarios, sustainable mobility or the price of carbon. For the price of carbon in Europe, the Shift suggests to set a reservation price to 20 euros and increase it every year. Since 2013, The Shift has been gathering experts on the energy rehabilitation of buildings and made propositions like the Energy Efficiency Passport. In addition to being experimented by the Shift through the nonprofit organization Exp√©rience P2E, this building passport was then included in the Energy Transition Law and is now used by various actors in the building industry. In 2016, at The Shift Project request, the engineer Francisco Luciano gathered a team of experts including the SNCF, Vinci Autoroutes, EDF, the CVTC, start-ups in car sharing, the senior official Olivier Paul-Dubois-Taine and researchers. In September 2017, The Shift published the report \\"Decarbonize mid-density areas ‚Äì Less carbon more bond\\", for which The Shift and the project leader Francisco Luciano were invited by the Ministry for Transportation to attend the Mobility Foundations and various governmental working groups. The report, which is aimed to be well-argued and quantitative, concludes that it is possible to strongly decarbonize mobility in suburban areas thanks to cycling, car sharing and fast public transports. The working group also studied the delivery of goods and remote work. On 4 October 2018, the think tank published a report on the digital economy impact on climate and environment.\\"For a digital sobriety\\": the new report by the Shift about the environmental impact of digital technology, The Shift Project, 4 octobre 2018. The report notes that the worldwide energy consumption of the digital economy grows at a very fast rate (about 9% a year) with a worsening energy efficiency, unlike most economic sectors. It concludes by advocating digital sobriety to minimize most of this impact growth.. Pledge for climate: The 2017 Decarbonize Europe Manifesto =The call for action of the economic actors= On 21 March 2017, the think tank made public the signatories of a text called \\"Decarbonize Europe Manifesto\\". This text is described as a wake-up call 15 months after the Paris Agreement. It begins with: \\"We, the signatories of this Manifesto to decarbonize Europe, call upon all European States to immediately implement policies aiming to achieve a level of greenhouse gas emissions close to zero by 2050!\\" and aims to \\"guarantee peace\\". It ends with: \\"We call upon all European actors ‚Äì individuals, businesses and public authorities ‚Äì to implement concrete and coherent strategies which can meet the challenge posed by climate change and the limits of natural resources.http://decarbonizeurope.org/en/\\" The Shift project claims the decarbonization of Europe is a challenge, but it is necessary for a modern future. It is supported by more than 3,000 citizens including 80 company directors and around forty scientists and political figures. The press mainly mentions the signature of economic leaders like the magazine Challenges: \\"Climate: Why the company directors (at last) unite to decarbonize Europe\\". The think tank then called candidates running for president for a commitment in favor of a European plan to fight climate change that would abide by the Paris Agreement =Signatories of the Manifesto= Company directors who signed the Manifesto include Elisabeth Borne (RATP), Martin Bouygues (Bouygues), Patricia Barbizet (Art√©mis-Kering), Guillaume Pepy (SNCF), Christophe Cuvillier (Unibail Rodamco), Nicolas Dufourq (BPI France), Pierre Blayau (Caise centrale de r√©assurance), St√©phane Richard (Orange), Alain Montarant (MACIF), Nicolas Th√©ry (Cr√©dit mutuel), Denis Kessler (SCOR), Xavier Huillard (Vinci), Jean-Dominique Senard (Michelin) and Agni√®s Ogier (Thalys). Scientists who signed the Manifesto include climatologists like Jean Jouzel, Herv√© Le Treut and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele; the biologist and senior official Dominique Dron; the mathematician Ivar Ekeland; physicists like S√©bastien Balibar, Roger Balian and Yves Br√©chet; economists like Ga√´l Giraud, Roger Guesnerie, Philippe Aghion, Christian de Perthuis, Jean-Marie Chevalier and Jean-Charles Hourcade; directors of grandes √©coles like Meriem Fournier (AgroParis-Tech Nancy), Olivier Oger (EDHEC) and Vincent Lafl√®che (Mines ParisTech). Other people who signed it include former ministers like Arnaud Montebourg, Serge Lepeltier, the Belgian Philippe Maystadt and the president of the union CFE-CGC Fran√ßois Hommeril. =Nine proposals= The Shift Project published \\"9 propositions to take Europe to a new area\\" about as many projects that should be done imperatively to meet the Paris Agreement, according to the Shift.

Serafimov, who was solely responsible for a murder in 1996, was shot by his partner Tolumov, who himself was subsequently apprehended and sentenced to life imprisonment. Biographies =Early lives= Both Tolumov and Serafimov were born in the little village of Duvanli, where they were childhood friends, but eventually separated after the former moved to Hisar so he could live with new wife, Penka, who later gave birth to three children. Not long after, Ludwig went on to temporarily live in Germany, before moving to Namibia. In the meantime, Serafimov became a habitual criminal, spending a total of 15 years behind bars after 8 consecutive sentences for aggravated robbery. While imprisoned, he earned the nickname \\"The Sweet\\" because of his ability to sweet talk and his love for sweets. After many years, while Serafimov was serving his 8th sentence for robbery in the Plovdiv Prison, he reunited with Tolumov, who was imprisoned for theft. During this prison stint, they decided to form their deadly criminal duet. After Serafimov's release in March 2000, he returned to a life of crime, now aided by his partner. =First murder= On May 13, 2000, a couple, consisting of 19-year-old Ruzhdiye Useinova from Pravoslaven and 20-year-old Sevgin Myumyun from Voden, had decided to go to a disco in the \\"Mogilata\\" complex near the village of Varbitsa, Haskovo Province. They had stopped at a gas station near Byala Reka to gas up their car, before continuing on their journey, only to stop again to the side of the road 20 minutes after midnight, so they could talk and kiss each other. Suddenly, from the darkness the silhouettes of two men appeared, who immediately attacked the couple without saying a word. The criminals broke the car's window and with slaps and kicks pulled out Sevgin and Ruzhdiye from the vehicle. They tried to attack the girl, whose boyfriend tried to defend her. However, Sevgin was beaten harshly, before being shot in the eyesocket and the spine. They lied to the girl that they had only knocked him out, and he'd be awake after 3-4 hours. The men then robbed the corpse of his gold earrings and rings, his telephone and cassette player, and then dragged it to some bushes by the road. Tolumov and Serafimov then forced the shocked Ruzhdiye into the car, driving her to a small chapel called \\"St. Elijah\\", where they brutally beat and subsequently raped her, one after the other. After the brutal deed, they proceeded to stab her 8 times in the neck, breasts and stomach before fleeing the scene, thinking they had eliminated their only witness, relying on the fact that the authorities might think that the murders were a result from a love-related drama between the two. However, Useinova had miraculously survived, the blade from the knife just barely missing her external carotid artery. After being unconscious for some time, the tortured woman eventually woke up, and managed to crawl her way to the road after some hours, where she was accidentally found by a Parvomay policeman. Barely managing to utter that she was attacked, she again lapsed into unconsciousness, whereupon the officer immediately brought her to the hospital. During the subsequent search of the area, Myumyun's body was located. While she was recovering from her injuries in hospital, Useinova was visited by the now-retired police sketch artist Atanas Marincheshki, to whom she described the offenders. The man managed to produce an incredibly accurate facial composite of Tolumov, as couldn't do the same for Serafimov, who had tried to hide his face from the victim. Shortly following the attack, the authorities managed to shorten the suspect circle to 20 names in the criminal registry, with detectives from the National Police's \\"Murders\\" Unit aiding the Plovdiv authorities, working 24 hours a day so they could resolve the crime. =Robberies and thefts= In the meantime, Tolumov and Serafimov continued with the criminal deeds. On June 6, the duo attacked a parked minibus in the \\"Troyan-Karnare\\" Pass, stealing combine parts and personal items worth 8265 leva. They threatened the driver, Tanyo Bahchevanski, and proceeded to steal the minibus itself, only to later abandon it. Five days later, they beat up and robbed a female taxi driver near the village of Belovitsa, and not long after, robbed a man from Sofia along the Trakia motorway. Three weeks after that, near the village of Mihiltsi, they robbed a man and a woman in a parked Moskvitch. The men fired at the car and forced to driver to lay down on the ground, but he managed to flee and call for help at a nearby gas station. Tolumov abandoned his partner, while Serafimov got into the car and forced the woman to have sex with him. =Double murder= On July 12, a body was found by accident near the architectural-historical memorial \\"Arch of Freedoms\\" in Beklemeto Pass. It was later revealed that on that day Tolumov and Serafimov had stopped the car of German tourists Christian Herlem and Heidi Colomb, both from Kassel - near Pavel Banya. There, they killed Herlem and later dropped off his body into the abyss, before taking Colomb to Mount Bratan, where she was reportedly raped. After raping her, both men threw the woman into the nearby swamp, effectively drowning her. Her skull was later located, with parts of her body scattered around the place, most likely by wild animals. The police quickly contacted German authorities, sending the victims' items to them. In order to capture the bandits, agents from Interpol took action, drawing accurate facial composites of the criminals in accordance to the surviving victims. Serafimov's death and Tolumov's capture While the investigators were working on capturing the criminals, distrust began to settle between Tolumov and Serafimov. On July 15, while driving towards Hisarya, the two began arguing. Tolumov, suspecting that his childhood friend was planning to kill him, offered to stop the car. Immediately after this, he pulled out his gun and shot Serafimov, killing him on the spot. He then put his body in the trunk of the car and dropped it off at a ditch near Tsarimir. To erase his traces, he later burned the car. Between July 19 and 20, a man and a woman working for TV company Evrokom, while trying to shoot footage for a film, accidentally found the body of a man who was dressed in a sailor's shirt and looked to be around his 40s. He had gunshot wounds to his back and chest area. Later fingerprint examinations proved that it was indeed Ivan \\"The Sweet\\" Serafimov. The police then proceeded to question his friends, calling in a total of 9 people, among them two women and a Vietnamese man. The deceased eerily matched the description of one of the perpetrators who had attacked Ruzhdiye Useinova, while his buddy Ludwig Tolumov looked like the other man. After a brief investigation, it was concluded that they had done a number of violent crimes, and that Tolumov had killed his partner. He was arrested in Hisarya soon after, without offering any resistance. Ludwig confessed to the rape of Useinova and the thefts, but denied the murders, only admitting to that of Serafimov, claiming to have done it to protect the lives of his family and other people. Evidence The authorities had strong evidence, including DNA samples, to convict Tolumov. It was determined that a pistol with a silencer was used in the murders of Herlem and Serafimov, while in the murder of Myumyun - an MP 40. In accordance to the different situations, the criminals would use either of the two weapons. The MP 40 was later found on August 10 in Tolumov's home. Although apparent that Serafimov was the main act in the murders, Tolumov acted as his accomplice without hesitation. Not only this, but the former is also thought to be responsible for the 1996 murder of a woman named Elena Filipova, in her home near the Plovdiv Boulevard \\"Maritsa\\". According to the psychoanalysis of Ludwig Tolumov, he is egocentric, selfish and demands control of others, feeling good when he controls the course of action and dominates over everybody else. He is devoid of any regret and likes to show off, but also stands out with a high degree of self-control. Trial and sentence During Tolumov's trial, he stated that the murder charges should be dropped, as he had acted in self-defence. After hearing this, Embie Myumyun, Sevgin's mother, began cussing at him. Sitting next to her was the still shocked Ruzhdiye. On July 3, 2003, Tolumov was sentenced to the harshest sentence available for aggravated murder - life imprisonment. He would have to serve it in the Plovdiv Central Prison under a special regime. In his last words to the court, he said the following: The magistrates also gave a guilty verdict over robbing tourists at Beklemeto Pass in June 2000, as well giving an additional 15 years imprisonment for murdering Ivan Serafimov. Aftermath On August 11, 2011, Ludwig's 22-year-old son, Slavi, was found hanging in the family home in Duvanli. Slavi had lived with his mother's family in Hisar's Catholic district, where his grandfather Milan was looking after him, as his mother was working abroad in Italy. His death was ruled a suicide, most likely due to the fact he couldn't suffer living with the knowledge that his father was a brutal killer. Just a month before, he had moved back to Duvanli and the empty house, which was abandoned after the grandparents had died years before. The villagers noted that he seemed depressed, didn't speak to anyone and refused to go to the caf√© with friends. The boy had worked in Italy as a builder on request by his mother, but he had decided to return to Bulgaria. His mother, Penka, had also lost her other son 2 years before. She currently lives isolated in a monastery. In response to this, Tolumov commented that this ruined his parents, who died during the trial, and that he still keeps the necrologues of his sons. He also said that he keeps regular contact with the priest in Novi Khan, sending him money for his children over Christmas and Easter. In 2014, Tolumov and another murderer, Dimitar Harakchiev, were awarded compensation of 3000 and 4000 leva following a trial in the Court of Justice of the European Union, due to the bad hygiene, ventilation and other problems which went on in the prison's cells. While imprisoned, Tolumov began writing an autobiography, detailing all the events of his life leading up to his arrest. He said the book would be called \\"Chronicles of a Life Sentence\\". His prison cell is considered lavish, as he has a flat screen TV, coffee machine, radio, a metal fan, renewed window panels and an old typing machine, on which he is currently writing the book.

On March 16, 2019, Buttigieg's campaign surpassed the 65,000 unique donor threshold to qualify for the presidential primary debates. = Campaign announcement = On April 14, 2019, Buttigieg's campaign was formally launched from South Bend, Indiana. = Fundraising = By the end of the first quarter of 2019, the campaign had raised more than $7 million. Democratic donor Susie Tompkins Buell sent invitations to a Buttigieg fundraiser scheduled for April 11, 2019; it sought contributions ranging from $250 to $2,800. Buell has also backed U.S. senator Kamala Harris in the 2020 race. Within four hours of Buttigieg's campaign launch, it raised over $1 million. On April 26, 2019, Pete Buttigieg announced that his campaign would no longer accept donations from registered lobbyists; and it then returned $30,250 in donations of this kind. Pete Buttigieg's campaign raised over $24.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, second to only Bernie Sanders in that quarter, and an amount that included funds from 230,000 new donors. Buttigieg has $22.6 million cash on hand, according to the campaign, with a total of 400,000 donors. = Polls = Buttigieg greeting supporters at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa A poll conducted by Emerson Polling between March 21 and 24, 2019, in the early battleground state of Iowa found Buttigieg in third place behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but ahead of other candidates such as Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Beto O'Rourke. A St. Anselm College poll conducted between April 3 and 8 in New Hampshire also placed Buttigieg in third. In June, a Yougov poll showed Buttigieg in fifth place nationwide by number of people considering voting for him. Polls in August and September showed he had low support among African-Americans. By mid-November, he had emerged as a potential frontrunner in Iowa polls. = African American support = Criticism of Buttigieg's handling of racial issues in South Bend led to doubts about his ability to attract black voters. Following the controversial shooting of Eric Logan, an African American man, by a white South Bend police officer in June 2019, Buttigieg put his campaign on hold to focus on the emerging public reaction. Buttigieg convened a local town hall on June 23, where he heard the grievances of disaffected activists in the African American community as well as relatives of Eric Logan. After the shooting, Buttigieg came under criticism for his management of the South Bend police department. This included scrutiny of the departure of half the African-American officers in the South Bend Police Department under Mayor Buttigieg, and the attrition of other African- American employees from that department. The tragedy was seen by some as a test of Buttigieg's ability to weather the rigours of the presidency. Buttigieg's campaign touted his record in reducing the African-American poverty rate in South Bend. It also pointed to Buttigieg administration initiatives such as the creation in 2016 of the first Officer for Diversity and Inclusion for the City of South Bend. His campaign sustained questions about the low level of city contracting with minority owned businesses and hiring of persons of color during Buttigieg's tenure as mayor. = Campaign slogans = The popular slogan of the Pete Buttigieg 2020 Campaign was \\"Win The Era\\" and the message of generational change. Another frequently used phrase by Buttigieg was \\"future former Republicans\\". He used his faith as a platform to say that ‚ÄúGod does not belong to a political party.‚Äù = Campaign finance violation complaint = In February 2020, a campaign finance watchdog group, filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint alleging that the Buttigieg campaign coordinated with a Super PAC. The complaint alleged that a tweet from a Buttigieg campaign was an attempt to bypass the FEC Act, which prohibits campaigns from coordinating with outside groups. Huffington Post noted it is in the fuzzy area of social media where there is an exception: ‚Äúif the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was obtained from a publicly available source‚Äù. = Campaign suspension = After a poor showing in the South Carolina primary, Buttigieg suspended his campaign on March 1, 2020. LGBTQ people showed support for the historic effort with a #ThankYouPete campaign on social media. According to the New York Times, former President Barack Obama called Buttigieg before the Super Tuesday primaries to tell him \\"that he would never have more leverage than on the day that he was quitting the race ‚Äî and the former South Bend mayor soon joined the avalanche of former candidates backing Mr. Biden.\\"  Democratic primary debates  The Democratic National Committee has scheduled a series of twelve primary debates, six each in 2019 and 2020. = First debate = The first debate was held June 26 and 27 in Miami, Florida. Due to the large number of candidates participating, twenty who qualified, the first two debates were divided into two nights, each with ten candidates; Buttigieg was placed in the latter group of candidates. On June 27, Buttigieg took part in the first 2020 Democratic Party presidential debate. He thus became the first openly gay presidential candidate to appear in a nationally televised presidential debate in the United States. = Second, third, and fourth debates = The second debate was held July 30 and 31 in Detroit. Buttigieg participated on the first night July 30. The third debate took place September 12 in Houston, Texas. Only ten candidates qualified, so it took place over the course of only one night. The fourth debate took place October 15 in Westerville, Ohio and was hosted by CNN and the New York Times. = Fifth debate = Buttigieg participated in the fifth debate along with nine other candidates, which took place on November 20 in Atlanta, Georgia. Instead of polling mid-pack, he was leading in Iowa, the first state primary, and was in the top tier in New Hampshire, the second. Buttigieg iterated his mayoral and military experience, stating \\"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly, where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small.\\" = Sixth debate = Buttigieg was one of six candidates that met the polling percentages and fundraising quotas for the sixth debate held December 19 in Los Angeles. The overall field of candidates has remained around twenty with some candidates dropping out, while others have entered or declared an interest to run. = Ninth debate = Buttigieg received mixed responses from the media following his debate performance, which focused mainly on dissecting Bernie Sanders viewpoints with much critique, in hopes to winning over supporters of the front runner with an alternative choice. Sanders responded by aiming at Buttigieg's campaign contributor list, consisting of billionaires. Buttigieg also tried to discredit his moderate competition in Amy Klobuchar, specifically highlighting the fact she forgot the name of the President of Mexico, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. Buttigieg notably criticized Michael Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders, stating \\"We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out. We can do better.\\" According to a Newsweek article, (who cited Statista), Pete Buttigieg had the 4th longest talking time, clocking in at 14 minutes 52 seconds during the debate.  Political positions  = Abortion = Buttigieg is pro-choice; as such, he supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion services in all but the most extreme circumstances. In 2018, as mayor, Buttigieg vetoed a South Bend Common Council rezoning decision that would have allowed a pro-life Women's Care Center to open next door to the abortion clinic, Whole Women's Health Alliance. The Women's Care Center eventually found an alternative location in South Bend. Even though the South Bend Common Council supported the rezoning exception, Buttigieg said, \\"I don‚Äôt think it would be responsible to situate two groups literally right next to each other ... that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.\\" He also expressed his concern that such a close proximity between their buildings would simply conduce to the harassment of the one side by the other. In May 2019, after the Alabama Legislature outlawed virtually all abortion services in the state by passing the Human Life Protection Act, Buttigieg said that it was \\"ignoring science, criminalizing abortion, and punishing women.\\" = Climate change = Buttigieg released a plan to combat climate change that rests on the following three pillars: building a clean economy through the creation of clean energy jobs; improving resilience by investing in disaster relief and prevention; and building the United States' role on the international stage in the urgent fight against climate change. Further, his proposal sets the aggressive benchmarks of doubling clean electricity in the U.S. by 2025, zero emissions in electricity generation by 2035, net-zero emissions from industrial vehicles by 2040, and a net-zero emissions by 2050. Buttigieg said that he would restore the United States' commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and double its pledge to the Green Climate Fund. He also said that the government should start subsidizing solar panels to reduce emissions. Buttigieg approves of the Green New Deal proposed by House Democrats. He also supports a carbon tax and dividend policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. =Criminal justice= Buttigieg supports the abolition of the death penalty. He has also called for restoring voting rights to former felons and moving toward reversing criminal sentences for minor drug-related offenses. He supports the \\"safe, regulated, and legal sale of marijuana.\\" In 2019, Buttigieg professed himself \\"troubled\\" by former President Obama's decision to commute the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Iraq War whistleblower, days before leaving office in 2017; Buttigieg also gave a mixed evaluation of Edward Snowden's disclosure of classified information, saying that \\"we've learned things about abuses and that one way or another that needed to come out\\" but that \\"the way for that to come out is through Congressional oversight, not through a breach of classified information.\\" In August 2019, Buttigieg released a plan to decriminalize drug addiction and mental illness, favoring diversionary programs over incarceration. =Economy and commerce= Buttigieg has frequently pointed to automation as the chief cause of the great loss of manufacturing jobs nationwide. Buttigieg has spent time talking with labor workers and has emphasized the need for democratic leaders to be in contact with labor unions. As a self-proclaimed democratic capitalist, Buttigieg supports a constitutional amendment to protect democracy from the undue and corruptive influence of money in politics. He is receptive to the possibility of antitrust actions against large technology companies but more focused on privacy and data security concerns. = Elections = Buttigieg favors the abolition of the Electoral College. He is on record saying that he supports reinstating convicted felons' right to vote once they are released, but not before. = Foreign policy = Buttigieg has said that he believes the post-9/11 invasion of Afghanistan was justified, but now supports withdrawing American troops from the region while maintaining an intelligence presence. Buttigieg is a committed supporter of Israel. However, he notably disapproves of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's zeal for annexing Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In January 2019, following Juan Guaid√≥'s self-declaration as interim president of Venezuela, Buttigieg told HuffPost that as a supporter of free and fair elections, he is amenable to potential sanctions but not a military intervention imposed on the country. On June 11, 2019, Buttigieg said: \\"We will remain open to working with a regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the American people. But we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals.\\" = Health care = At the start of his campaign, Buttigieg advocated for a single-payer healthcare system. Buttigieg later promoted \\"Medicare for All Who Want It\\", a plan that would implement a public option for healthcare insurance, while allowing private healthcare insurers to remain in business. In August 2019, Buttigieg released a $300 billion plan to expand mental health care services and fight addiction. = Immigration = Buttigieg supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and has rebuked the Trump administration's deportation policies. He defended a resident of Granger, Indiana, who was deported after living in the U.S. for 17 years despite having regularly checked in with ICE and applied for a green card. Buttigieg has said that Trump has been reckless in sending American troops to the southern border, and that it is a measure of last resort. = Judicial issues = Buttigieg has said that he believes the Supreme Court needs structural reform, emphasizing depoliticization and suggesting that the court be expanded to 15 members, five of whom can only be seated by unanimous consensus of the other ten. = Racial equality = In May 2019, Buttigieg warned that President Donald Trump and his administration were using white identity politics, which he identified as the most divisive form of identity politics. * In July 2019 Buttigieg shared his Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to address systemic racism in America. Announcing it at a Chicago meeting of Jesse Jackson‚Äôs Rainbow/PUSH civil rights organization, Buttigieg compared the plan's scope to that of the U.S.'s Marshall Plan, which invested funds in war-torn Europe after World War II, and said it would address \\"opportunity for minority businesses, strengthening voting rights, and reforming the criminal justice system.\\" The initiative allocates $10 billion to African-American entrepreneurship over five years, grants $25 billion to historically black colleges, legalizes marijuana, expunges records of drug convictions, halves the federal prison population, and passes a federal New Voting Rights Act designed to increase voting access. The rollout of the Douglass Plan was the subject of controversy. The Intercept reported that in a press release about the plan, the campaign had listed three prominent members of the South Carolina black community, none of whom had endorsed Buttigieg and only one of whom had endorsed the plan. After criticism of the press release, the Buttigieg campaign responded that they had sent the plan to a list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want to be included. The campaign also received criticism for displaying a stock photo of a woman from Kenya on their page promoting the plan, which was later removed. = Social issues = Buttigieg favors amending civil rights legislation with the Federal Equality Act so that LGBT Americans also receive federal non-discrimination protections. He opposes the ban on transgender people participating in the military that was enacted by Trump. He also supports expanding opportunities for national service and has said that he is open to making a yearlong term of national service mandatory for those turning 18 years old. \\"One thing we could do ... would be to make it, if not legally obligatory, then certainly a social norm that anybody after they're 18 years old spends a year in national service\\", he said. In July 2019 Buttigieg announced a plan to increase participation in national service organizations like AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps, as well as creating new ones dedicated to ‚Äúfighting climate change, treating mental health and addiction, and providing caregiving for older people‚Äù. The initiative prioritizes volunteering in predominantly minority communities and rural areas by tripling programs to 250,000 people at first, then expanding to one million by 2026. = Statehood = Buttigieg is an advocate for the statehood of Washington, D.C., He has also indicated that he would support Puerto Rican statehood \\"if they want it.\\" = Workers' rights = In July 2019, Buttigieg released a plan for the empowerment of workers in the changing economy, by raising the minimum wage to $15, and by offering paid family leave nationwide. Endorsements  Caucuses and primaries  Buttigieg at the 2019 California Democratic Party State Convention There are fifty-seven states and territories with 3,979 pledged delegates that candidates try to secure‚Äîin addition there are 771 superdelegates who make up about fifteen percent of the total‚Äîtoward getting the final endorsement of the Democratic National Convention (DNC). If any candidate gets to the July 13 DNC (in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) with at least 1,990‚Äìa simple majority not including the superdelegates‚Äîthey are the presidential nominee. If no candidate has a majority of delegates, the superdelegates vote in hopes one candidate has 2,376 delegates, the new majority needed; if not, a contested or brokered convention takes place where delegates are released over a series of votes until a candidate emerges with a majority. =Early states (February)= In early February 2020, Buttigieg led the Iowa caucus results, the first state to have elections‚Äîwith 41 Democratic delegates available, with a narrow lead of 26.2% to Bernie Sanders‚Äô 26.1%, winning fourteen delegates to Sanders‚Äô twelve; the results came after a recount in 95 counties where irregularities were reported, a recanvass request is expected. The LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg's first national endorsement, noted the historical first of an LGBTQ candidate winning a presidential state election. In the New Hampshire primary (February 11)‚Äîwith 24 delegates available‚Äîthe first in the nation, Buttigieg got 24.4% of votes trailing Sanders‚Äô 25.7% earning each nine delegates; in third was Amy Klobuchar with 19.8% getting six delegates. The Nevada caucuses, held February 22, have thirty-six delegates available; Sanders (46.8%) getting 24 delegates, Joe Biden (20.2%), with nine delegates, and Buttigieg (14.3%) getting three. The South Carolina primary (February 29) has fifty-four delegates; Biden won (48.4%), Sanders (19.9%), then Tom Steyer (11.3%), and Buttigieg (8.2%). Steyer had staked his personal fortune on the effort and tied it to winning the state; he has dropped out of the race. As of February 29, Buttigieg has 26 delegates, and almost 17% of the popular vote.  LGBTQ representation  The Daily Beast notes Buttigieg's campaign as a ‚Äútrailblazer‚Äù for LGBTQ representation in politics and society. He addressed his being gay candidly ‚Äúin a way no other public figure has done‚Äù. Buttigieg also rebuffed ‚Äúattacks from homophobic bigots‚Äù by invoking his Christian faith. He discussed his marriage at campaign events, and publicly showed affection to his husband. According to The Daily Beast his ‚Äúcandidacy has shown young people anxious about coming out that being gay is no longer a barrier to full participation in our society‚Äù.

SocialWorks was founded in support of Chicago Public Schools (CPS). SocialWorks raises money for social issues that affect Chicago's youth, such as education, homelessness, mental health support, as well as to create spaces and bring visibility to Chicago's artistic community. Bennet founded SocialWorks with the intention of ‚Äúgiving back to his community.‚Äù  History  SocialWorks became a registered public charity in August, 2016. The non- profit charity was announced September 24, 2016, at Bennet's music festival, Magnificent Coloring Day, on the South Side of Chicago. The inception of this non-profit began in 2015 with OpenMike, an event which is hosted monthly and offers a creative space for Chicago's youth to perform and to be exposed to art. In January 2015, Chance teamed up with the program Get Schooled, Get Connected in order to raise $100,000 for technological equipment for CPS. This was a precedent for SocialWorks‚Äô Support CPS Initiative. As a result of this fundraising, SocialWorks came into formation, under the partnership of Bennett, Cunningham and their friend Essence Smith. The initial funding for the charity came from Bennett, who donated $1 million. SocialWorks initiated the Support CPS and the New Chance: Arts and Literature Fund campaigns, which raise money for education, technological equipment, and arts programs in schools in under served areas which have experienced budget cuts. In 2017 Google partnered with SocialWorks and awarded the program a grant of 1 million, and an additional $500,000 directly donated to CPS. Chance discussed the funding on Twitter, stating that it would fund ‚Äúcoding classes for 20 schools on the South and West side.‚Äù In 2017, at an assembly at Michele Clark High School, Jewel Osco donated 1 million to the charity. The money was designated for the New Chance: Arts and Literature Fund.  Initiatives  The organization operates five campaigns: Support CPS, which raises money for Chicago Public Schools, My State of Mind, which raises funds to increase accessibility to mental health services, The Warmest Winter, which operates clothing drives for the homeless, OpenMike, which supports young artists in Chicago, and Kids of the Kingdom, which provides funding for educational summer programs. =Support CPS= SocialWorks Grants Funds to Schools through their New Chance Fund New Chance Fund The Support CPS fund was launched in 2017 by Bennett and SocialWorks after budget discussions with Governor Bruce Rauner over funding for CPS reached an impasse. Bennett donated $1 million to the fund and awareness was raised for Support CPS through the hashtag #SupportCPS on social media. Following his donation individuals, businesses, and organizations such as Jewel Osco, the Chicago Bulls, Google, and STATE Bags also made donations. During that same year SocialWorks partnered with CPS and Ingenuity, an arts advocacy organization, to create the New Chance Literature and Arts Fund in order to raise money for arts programs in schools experiencing severe budget cuts. In 2018 SocialWorks announced that $2.2 million had been raised through the New Chance Fund and that twenty CPS would be receiving donations of $100,000 to help fund their arts and literature programs. The organization also partnered with shared riding service Lyft to raise money for new arts and literature programs for CPS. Donations would be gathered by riders opting in to round up their fares and since its launch, the initiative has raised over $100,000. SocialWorks has also raised funding for CPS by partnering with UNITY to host the #SupportCPS fashion show, which featured student created designs to raise money for CPS and support local artists. = My State Of Mind = The My State of Mind initiative was introduced in September 2018 to increase awareness and visibility for mental health services in Chicago, Illinois. The initiative began with a $1 million donation from Bennett, with the intention to establish a modern resource for obtaining information about mental health services. Essence Smith further commented that a central goal of the initiative is to create a guidebook filled with \\"a comprehensive collection of mental health resources.\\" The guidebook is designed to include all mental health services, both direct care and referral-based; as well as, educational services within Cook county. Through this initiative the organization plans to donate $100,000 to six mental health providers in the city. = The Warmest Winter = The Warmest Winter Initiative was first announced in December 2015 through a radio appearance Chance made at a local Chicago radio station, WGCI FM 107.5. The initiative was created through a partnership with The Empowerment Plan to help raise $100,000 U.S dollars for winter coats through donations. These donations would be used to fund the employment of homeless people from Detroit, who would create coats that were capable of being turned into sleeping bags for homeless people in Chicago. Incentives such as tickets to games or shows were used to encourage people to donate and sponsor the cost of a coat for the initiative, which was initially only planned to run until 2016. SocialWorks took over the initiative after their creation in 2016 and has continued Warmest Winter after re-branding it to offer different services, experiences and donations. Efforts by the initiative in its current state include clothing drives and events such as the \\"Night at the Museum\\", where families bring in items to build Warmth Kits for the homeless while also participating in exhibits and activities. = OpenMike = Picture from OpenMike event OpenMike is a series of free monthly events hosted in Chicago, for high school students that could provide their school ID. OpenMike was officially hosted on February 2015 at the Chicago Cultural Center, as an event to honor the passing of poet Mike Hawkins, Brother Mike. It was first started between Chance the Rapper and Malcolm London but was later incorporated into SocialWorks. Because Brother Mike was a poet and mentor with Harold Washington Library's YouMedia Center, OpenMike incorporated coordinates programs that encourages teen artists to perform and connect with other artists in attendance. OpenMike also has celebrity guest performances, like Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, and they occasionally have different partnerships that take place. In December 2017, the Air Jordan brand teamed up with SocialWorks in a one-time event. Air Jordan donated 300 pairs of unreleased Jordan 11 sneakers to teens attending OpenMike at Cindy Pritzker Auditorium. = Kids of the Kingdom = Kids Of the Kingdom Summer Day Camp Kids of the Kingdom is a program created in 2017 by Social Works and LANDR Music to provide additional audio mastering classes after school for students in the Chicago metropolitan area. Starting in June 2017, 75 Chicago kids participated in this program through the Kids of the Kingdom Summer Music Academy. The idea behind this initiative is to provide a space for kids to be social, learn, and become civically engaged in their community. LANDR Music donated $1 for every new user of their website and 10% of its profits to SocialWorks between the dates of June 6 and June 20, 2017.  Partnerships and Donors  My State of Mind partners with Two Goats, JPA, DHS, and Cook County Public Health. OpenMike partners with Chicago Public Library and the Jordan Brand. Support CPS partners with Ingenuity, Children First Fund, Google, Lyft, Jewel Osco, Conagra Brands, Sky Zone, and Champion. The Warmest Winter partners with the Field Museum, Michael Airhart, and the Museum of Science and Industry.  Events  =Black History Month Film Festival= The Black History Month Film Festival was launched in 2018 and runs during the month of February, offering reduced price tickets for youth to attend and familiarize themselves with films created by Black artists. The 2018 festival featured a selection of five films at Chicago's Studio Grill with showings rotating each week. In 2019 the program moved to the Showplace Icon Theater, where fifteen films were shown and patrons could attend panel discussions and Q&A; post-screening interviews with film directors and special guests. =Parade To The Polls= In November 2016 SocialWorks teamed up with Chicago Votes for a get out and vote initiative. This was an effort to encourage young Chicagoans to vote. The event started with a free concert in Grant Park and ended when Chance led thousands of fans through the streets of Chicago to The Chicago Board of Elections. =Mahalia Jackson Elementary School: New Auditorium= At the end of March 2019, Bennett announced, via Instagram, Mahalia Jackson Elementary School as a new beneficiary of SocialWorks, New Chance Arts and Literature fund. The South side school was deemed needy after a prolonged lack of funding for the art programs. The grant allowed the school to finish construction of a new performing arts auditorium.

The company is focusing on developing a low-cost smart antenna system for cellular and satellite communication. ALCAN Systems plans to produce smart antennas which are flat, thin and able to steer their beam electronically without any moving parts. This allows mounting them inconspicuously on moving vehicles (e.g. cars, trains, airplanes, ships) to track different types of satellites (GEO, MEO & LEO) as well as 5G cellular networks. ALCAN‚Äôs technology is based on liquid crystal (LC) based phased-arrays that are capable of operating in the millimeter and microwave band of the RF spectrum.  History  ALCAN Systems‚Äô technology is based on original research initiated at the Institute for Microwave Engineering and Photonics (IMP) at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Prof. Rolf Jakoby, director of the IMP and later co-founder of ALCAN Systems, started his research on liquid crystal in radio-frequency applications in 1999. He is considered the father of LC RF applications. Onur H. Karabey joined Jakoby‚Äôs research team as a research assistant and started to work on his PhD thesis in 2009. Dr. Karabey finished his PhD research in 2012 and published his results under the name ‚ÄúElectronic Beam Steering and Polarization Agile Planar Antennas in Liquid Crystal Technology‚Äù in 2014. In 2014 ALCAN, which stands for ‚ÄúAdaptive Liquid Crystal Antenna‚Äù, started as a research project at TU Darmstadt. Seed funding of ‚Ç¨650,000 for the project was provided by the EXIST funding program of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. In 2016 the project team spun out from the university and became an independent company. ALCAN Systems GmbH was founded by Onur H. Karabey, A. Burak Olcen, Esat M. Sibay and Rolf Jakoby. At the end of 2016 ALCAN raised ‚Ç¨7.5 million in a Series A funding round. The investment was made by a consortium consisting of Merck, SES and SPC.  Patented technology  ALCAN‚Äôs beam steering capability is implemented using a liquid crystal layer inside a phased-array antenna. The liquid crystal is controlled by an electric field which changes the direction of the received or transmitted beam without the antenna physically turning at all, so that there are no moving parts. The antennas will consist of separate receiving and transmitting apertures operating at Ku or Ka band. The switching time of the antenna between two satellites will be under 50ms, which enables the antenna to meet the requirements of MEO and LEO constellation satellites. In 2018 ALCAN successfully field tested the world‚Äôs first liquid crystal based phased array antenna for satellite communication.  Partnerships  = Partnership with SES = In April 2018 ALCAN was announced as a technical partner of SES Networks. ALCAN will develop an antenna for SES‚Äôs new O3b mPOWER satellites.  Business model  ALCAN‚Äôs focus is to develop antennas based on requirements provided by satellite operators and service providers. ALCAN is targeting long-term a price range of under $1.000 for the consumer segment and under $10.000 for the enterprise segment. These targets can be achieved by using existing LCD production lines to produce the required liquid crystal phase shifter panels that go into the antenna. Furthermore, ALCAN plans to produce smaller consumer antennas for land mobile, maritime and home broadband market that will develop due to the start of LEO/MEO satellites and 5G roll out.

He also studied briefly with Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, author of \\"Chatan Sofer\\". In 1889 he married the daughter of Yaakov Rappaport of Bardeyov. After his marriage, he spent five years in Bardeyov, where he founded and chaired a yeshiva throughout his stay in the city. At the beginning of 1907 he was elected rabbi of the Jewish community of Tzehlim, where he also headed a large yeshiva. In 1912 he moved to serve as Rabbi of Oberwischau, and headed a yeshiva that numbered hundreds of students.

Because the prosencephalon gives way to the cerebral cortex, survival with aprosencephaly is not possible outside utero. The external symptoms are similar to holoprosencephaly, a related disorder, including a smaller than normal head (microcephaly), small eyeballs (microphthalmia), a small mouth (microstomia), anal atresia (no anus), and abnormalities of the external genitalia, radius, nostrils, and pharynx (throat).  Presentation  There are many different symptoms that may indicate the presence of aprosencephaly. Patients typically have a smaller than normal skull, eyes, and mouth, termed microcephaly, microphthalmia, and microstomia. The eyes themselves may be closely separated (hypotelorism) or fused (cyclopia). Infants affected by aprosencephaly often have a variety of abnormalities in the bones of the forearm, hand, and foot (called pre-axial limb defects), including small or absent thumbs, small or absent big toe, small hands, and various malformations of the radius (the main bone in the forearm). Other associated symptoms include anal atresia, in which an infant is born without an anus, atrial septal defect (a hole between the top two chambers of the heart), ventricular septal defect (a hole between the bottom two chambers of the heart), and ambiguous genitalia. During pregnancy, too much amniotic fluid may be present, a condition called polyhydramnios.  Causes  No single cause is responsible for aprosencephaly. In 2005, it was found that autosomal recessive mutations of the SIX3 gene located on the short arm of chromosome 2 could result in aprosencephaly. Some cases were linked to trisomy 13, a disorder which also has a correlation with holoprosencephaly.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of aprosencephaly is made clinically with the use of skeletal imaging, brain imaging, and autopsy. Almost all fetuses with aprosencephaly naturally miscarry before the third trimester.  History  A case of XK aprosencephaly was first reported in 1977, and was proposed as a genetic syndrome in 1988. As of 2015, less than 10 cases of aprosencephaly are reported in the medical literature.  Terminology  Aprosencephaly is named so by combining the Greek prefix a- (without, lacking) and -prosencephalon (the embryonic forebrain). The syndromic form is known as XK aprosencephaly, with 'X' and 'K' referring to the surnames of the first two patients described with aprosencephaly.

Braven teaches students soft and networking skills during the Braven Accelerator course, in which students work in teams lead by professionals from different industries. After completing the Braven Accelerator Course, Braven Fellows remain a part of the organization's system in the Post Course Experience Program. Braven has partnerships with San Jose State, Rutgers-Newark, and National Louis University's Harrison Professional Pathways Program. History Braven was founded in 2013 by Aimee Eubanks Davis. Davis stated that she had assumptions about her skills due to her race and background, which prompted her decision to launch Braven. Davis had previously worked for Summerbridge New Orleans and also as an executive for Teach for America. Braven began their first university partnership with San Jose University in 2014, and since then partnered with Rutgers-Newark and National Louis University. Volunteers The Braven Accelerator is run by volunteers, also known as leadership coaches, that are recruited, trained, and often employed by large corporations. These leadership coaches agree to work on a semester basis and are expected to commit around 60 hours per semester. Leadership coaches work as recruiters and student advocates. They can also conduct mock interviews or be professional mentors for students in a specific field of study. Programs = Braven Accelerator Course = Braven offers the Braven Accelerator course, a program in which Braven Fellows are grouped in cohorts of five to eight students. Each cohort is supervised by one or more leadership coaches for the duration of the program. The course offers an online and in-person experience to students for college credit. Fellows are required to meet weekly and complete weekly online modules to build skills in operating and managing, problem solving, working in teams, networking and communicating, and self-driven leading. Activities outside of the classroom include networking events, workshops focused on storytelling, as well as partnering with a company to solve a real life problem as a cohort. The organization specifically reaches out to students of color, first-generation college students, and low-income students pursuing a liberal arts or vocational degree. =Post Course Experience Program= After Braven students complete the Braven Accelerator Course, they become part of the Post Course Experience program by default. The Post Course Experience program is the ongoing assistance from coaches to ensure that students are getting the support they need after college graduation. The program brings students closer to the workplace by providing mentors, access to job and internship opportunities, and networking opportunities. The programs offered by Braven are not alternatives to college, but rather a supplementary course load that works on professional development skills. Both programs put emphasis on the cohort model of peers. Locations Braven partners with public universities to provide underrepresented students with the tools and guidance to transition from a college environment to a work environment. The organization first partnered with San Jose State University in 2014, expanding over the following five years to partner with Rutgers University-Newark in Newark, New Jersey in 2015, and National Louis University in Chicago, Illinois in 2018. Partners Braven partners with Salesforce, Prudential, Charles Schwab, LinkedIn, CIBC, IBM, and Credit Karma. Sponsor partners volunteer their time to Braven, hold events, donate, and allow Braven fellows to intern at their companies. Additionally, the Peery Foundation awarded Braven a $50,000 grant before the first cohort of Braven Fellows graduated.

Ungerleider.‚ÄúEnd Game‚Äù Shortlisted For Oscar It was released by Netflix.  Synopsis  The documentary begins with Dr. Pantilat, the palliative care doctor at the University of California, San Francisco, visiting terminally ill patients to speak with them about palliative care. The first patient he speaks about this with is Kym Anderson and her husband. Dr. Pantilat begins to describe palliative care as helping people live as well as possible for as long as possible; a care that focuses on not only the disease but the whole person, where there are people to help the patient with their symptoms, ensure the patient has the information they need to make complex decisions about their health, and have an extra layer of support for themselves and their family. Despite Dr. Pantilat‚Äôs attempt to bring light to palliative care, Kym and her husband do not side with palliative care as an option for Kym‚Äôs remaining time. The label the couple has associated with palliative care is ‚Äúkissing it goodbye.‚Äù The documentary then proceeds to the Zen Caregiving Project, where there has been the acquisition of a new patient named Bruce. Bruce is 66 years old and has made the choice to stop dialysis. Dr. BJ Miller, a palliative care physician, and his colleagues welcome Bruce into the home. Within the Zen Caregiving Project is another patient named Pat Harris. Pat has been diagnosed with fibroids and uterus cancer. Despite the circumstances, Pat mentions she is doing well, as she has people in the Zen Caregiving Project who help her watch the symptoms she experiences and understand what is right or wrong with it, people that give her medicine and monitor it, so she does not have to do it alone. Pat then goes onto describe a possible treatment to prolong her life in chemotherapy. To assist Pat with her decision, registered nurses from the palliative care team help Pat weigh out her options. Ultimately, Pat decides to accept the chemotherapy treatment in an attempt to prolong her life. Dr. Pantilat and his colleagues then meet with Mitra, a 45 year old woman battling cancer, and her family. Dr. Pantilat and his team ask Mitra‚Äôs family whether or not they would prefer to provide treatment for Mitra or keep her at home and provide care from there. The decision of prolonging Mitra‚Äôs life is split between her mother, Vija, and her husband, Hamid. Dr. Pantilat and his team continue to talk through the situation with Mitra‚Äôs family to help answer their questions and ultimately choose what they feel is right. As part of the information being provided by Dr. Pantilat and his team, Dr. Bivona proposes the idea that Mitra becomes part of a research program where doctors try to understand what happened to the cancer via autopsy. As the documentary progresses, Dr. Pantilat had his role as the palliative care doctor taken over by Giovanni Elia. Dr. Elia meets with Mitra and her family, where Mitra admits she is no longer doing well. Dr. Elia and his supporting cast then begin to speak with Mitra‚Äôs family about Mitra‚Äôs state; the doctors admit that Mitra is looking better from a short term perspective, but she has a limited time to live. Dr. Elia asks Mitra‚Äôs family where she would like to be during these final moments of her life, where he mentions that inpatient hospice is a choice for Mitra. Mitra‚Äôs mother disagrees with the idea of inpatient hospice, as she would like to be with Mitra until her last breath; however, Mitra‚Äôs family is torn with the decision. As Mitra‚Äôs condition worsens, Azita, Mitra‚Äôs sister, explains to her mother that caring for Mitra at home would not serve as a just option for Mitra nor for Vaji. Dr. Miller eventually meets with Thekla, who is experiencing shortness of breath, at the University of California, San Francisco, Symptom Management Service. Dr Miller does not necessarily dive into what Thekla‚Äôs shortness of breath may lead to, but rather he encourages Thekla to form a relationship with death, so that death is known and not as frightening. Dr. Miller attempts to change Thekla‚Äôs perspective on death, as he mentions that one cannot know what it is exactly like to be dead, so all that can be done is getting acclimated with the mystery that is called death. As the documentary comes to a close, Dr. Miller explains that there is nothing medical about death, but it is something that is purely human and a time to celebrate and rejoice the deceased's life.

Protesting low pay, large class sizes, inadequate support staffs of nurses and librarians, and the proliferation of charter schools, the teachers went on strike for the first time in the district in 30 years. The strike was authorized by United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA).  Background  In September 2018, 98% of UTLA union members authorized a strike over numerous disputes and a failure of months of contract negotiations. Dec. 15, 2018. UTLA Pre-Strike Rally, Downtown, Los Angeles. Demands included familiar issues such as salary increases and classroom size reduction, though a new issue predominated the discussions: the authority and control over the proliferation of charter schools. The fact-finding report failed to resolve matters; UTLA stated that a strike would proceed on January 10, 2019.L.A. teachers strike appears more likely as a key report fails to bring the union and district together, Howard Blume, December 18, 2018  Strike and negotiations  On January 14, 2019, 30,000 teachers walked out in what was the first teacher's strike in Los Angeles since 1989. The strike lasted six days. Schools remained open, with replacement teachers and administrative staff filling in for the striking teachers, but school attendance was estimated to have dropped to less than half during the strike. Teachers and their supporters held rallies around the city, including at City Hall and LAUSD headquarters. (Jan., 17, 2019) On Day 4 of the UTLA strike, Venice HS teachers walk the picket line in the rain. Jan. 15, 2019, Little Tokyo. UTLA rally on the second day of the strike. Day 1, Jan. 14, 2019. UTLA teachers converge in downtown, Los Angeles. UTLA and LAUSD reached a deal on January 22, 2019, after an all-night negotiating session. (Jan. 22, 2019, Downtown, LA) With the strike over, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl and union officers thank strikers and supporters. (Jan. 22, 2019, Downtown, LA). UTLA teachers celebrate the end of their strike The agreement included a 6 percent pay raise for teachers, a reduction in class size by 4 students per class for grades four through 12 over the course of three years, the removal of a provision that had previously allowed larger class sizes during times of economic hardship, and a \\"commitment to provide a full-time nurse in every school\\" as well as a librarian for every middle and high school. The deal also included the establishment of 30 community schools around the district, modeled after similar programs in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Austin, Texas, seeking to provide students with social services and learning experiences in the arts. The deal contained no binding agreements on charter schools, but it did include a non-binding resolution calling on the state to establish a cap on charter schools. = Post-Strike Successes: Legislative and Electoral = Following the strike, UTLA, together with the California Teachers Association, successfully lobbied California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign two bills into law to hold charter schools more accountable and to give school districts the power to deny charter authorizations. Senate Bill 126, previously vetoed by former Governor Jerry Brown, requires charter schools to conduct open meetings, produce requested records under the California Public Records Act and avoid conflicts of interest in contracts. Assembly Bill 1505 empowers school districts to deny charter authorizations that might negatively impact the fiscal health of the district and to close charter schools that fail to adequately serve special education students. On the electoral front, in May, 2019, a few months after the strike, UTLA celebrated the overwhelming election of the union endorsed candidate, Jackie Goldberg, former LAUSD school board member and former assemblywoman, to represent District Five on the LAUSD school board, shifting the balance of power to support existing neighborhood schools.  Response  This was first teachers' strike in the LAUSD in 30 years. The strike encouraged a walkout in Virginia, a longtime right-to-work state scheduled to begin on January 28, 2019 if the Virginia Education Association does not have their demands met by the Government of Virginia.

The organization supplies shoes to individuals in the United States, as well as third world countries such as Uganda, Mexico, Peru and Guatemala. Share Your Soles sets up various fundraisers and develops partnerships in order to gain funds for their organization.  History  Share Your Soles was established in 1999 after its founder, Mona Purdy, visited Guatemala to run a half marathon. Ms. Purdy noticed several individuals, especially children, placing hot tar under their feet as soles. An orthopedic surgeon informed Ms. Purdy that people without shoes were at higher risk of contracting parasites or disease from contaminated soil, and he often had to amputate limbs due to these issues. This motivated Ms. Purdy to partner with churches, schools, scout troops, civic organizations, and individuals to help collect and deliver shoes to those in need. The first batch of shoes was collected by Ms. Purdy within her neighborhood in Palos Park, Illinois. Ms. Purdy set a collection goal of 1,000 pairs of shoes, which she partially collected in front of her home. Venture by airlines and embassies assisted Mona Purdy and shipped the collected shoes to Guatemala free of charge. Drop boxes are now located across the Chicago metropolitan area. Over the years Share Your Soles and Ms. Purdy have been honored by the American Red Cross, Chicagoan of the Year and the Chicago City Council as well as by many organizations across the south and southwest suburbs, where she got her start. The organization opened their first facility in 2003 and in 2011 moved to Chicago's Pullman community. The Pullman Distribution Warehouse was eventually moved to its permanent home ,The Historic Pullman Stables on S Cottage Grove Ave. As of 2014 the organization has delivered more than 2 million shoes to men, women, and children in impoverished areas around the world.  Mission statement  Share Your Soles looks to donate gently worn and new shoes to those in need. In order for the organization to have success within their mission statement they have developed long standing programs and also receive help from corporate sponsors that aid them in reaching their yearly goals. Working with volunteers and contributors has allowed them to transport the shoes to over 47 countries.  Programs  Ms. Purdy developed programs so that volunteers and workers can earn a pair of shoes. Once an individual fulfilled all requirements for a certain order, they would receive a voucher to get their earned pair of shoes. = Will Learn to Earn = The \\"Will Learn to Earn\\" program was designed for children and young adults in school with a low socioeconomic status. Children and young adults would write an essay on how a pair of soles would benefit them and would receive a pair of shoes in return. This program enabled children to get a pair of track shoes or winter boots. = Will Work to Earn = The \\"Will Work to Earn\\" program allows adults to earn a pair of shoes by volunteering their time at the warehouse. Individuals also had the option to help out their community in order to receive a pair of shoes. Adults in the program were able to pick out shoes they need for their everyday life.  Contributions  Street location of Share Your Soles. Share Your Soles works with 20 to 50 volunteers each week. Volunteers can raise funding or collect and sort through shoes, which will be packed accordingly to their destination. Fundraising efforts have included marathons and musical events and Annual Galas. In 2014 Share Your Soles donated shoes to students at Eisenhower Elementary in Flint, Michigan, where children were able to receive footwear by contributing three hours of kindness by performing activities such as basic chores. Eisenhower Elementary is considered a Pathways school and volunteers work with these schools to identify and remove barriers to the children attending the school. The organization donated over 300 pairs of shoes and has continued to annually donate to Flint. The Illinois Bone and Joint Institute (IBJI) partnered with Share Your Soles in 2010 and hosted a shoes drive for Haiti. This drive was intended to help individuals in Haiti after an earthquake on January 12th, 2010. The earthquake caused significant damage with 230,000 deaths and 1 million individuals forced to live in tents. 5004 pairs of shoes were collected and shipped out to the country. Share Your Soles has also hosted fundraising events such as the 2016 Help for Haiti, where the profits were directed to the citizens of Haiti after their encounter with Hurricane Matthew. In 2019 the organization hosted a fundraiser celebrating their 20th anniversary, where proceeds were used to aid children in attending school by providing them shoes. Share Your Shoes donated approximately 5,000 pairs of shoes to the people of Zimbabwe when the Mayor of Zimbabwe, Muchadeyi Masunda visited Chicago. Ms. Purdy has collected over three million pairs of shoes to impoverished areas over the last 20 years. These countries include Central America, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and the United States.  Awards and Recognition  Share Your Soles donated 15,000 pairs of shoes to the civilians of Sri Lanka after a tsunami hit their land in 2004. On June 11, 2009, Purdy received her first Award Service to Mankind by the Foundation for Civilian Bravery for the donation of 15,000 pairs to Sri Lanka. In 2017, the University of St. Francis grants the Sister Clare Award to Mona Purdy in honor of Women‚Äôs History Month. According to the University of St. Francis, this award is given to women who ‚Äútransformed the world of their time‚Äù.

Demonstrations began following Maduro's controversial second inauguration, developing into a presidential crisis between Maduro and National Assembly president Juan Guaid√≥. The protests also include counter- demonstrations organized by those who support Maduro.  National protests  The Wall Street Journal reported in a March 2019 article entitled \\"Maduro loses grip on Venezuela's poor, a vital source of his power\\" that slums are turning against Maduro and that \\"many blame government brutality for the shift\\". Foro Penal said that 50 people‚Äîmostly in slums‚Äîhad been killed by security forces in only the first two months of the year, and 653 had been arrested for protesting or speaking against the government. There have also been rival demonstrations in support of the Bolivarian Revolution, Maduro's government and against foreign intervention. Retired general Hugo Carvajal‚Äîthe head of Venezuela's military intelligence for ten years during Hugo Ch√°vez's presidency, who served as a National Assembly deputy for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela and was considered a pro-Maduro legislator, Also available online. \\"one of the government's most prominent figures\\"‚Äîsaid that Maduro orders the so-called \\"spontaneous protests\\" in his favor abroad, and his partners finance them. = Nicol√°s Maduro's inauguration = Many Venezuelans did not support the inauguration of Maduro, and held protests across the nation and in the capital city, Caracas. Several cacerolazos were reported across Caracas, including near to where Maduro was being sworn-in. Maduro supporters demonstrated separately. Before the inauguration, the opposition had called on the people to protest during the inauguration, with one protest co-hosted by students led by Rafaela Requesens and Guaid√≥'s Popular Will party, blocking off a road near UCV. = Open cabildos = Treated as a form of peaceful protest, several open cabildos were held in January 2019. The first of these was on 11 January, held by Guaid√≥. In the streets of Caracas people gathered to support him. = January = In anticipation of the protests on 23 January, other violent protests occurred. On 21 January there was a small-scale attempted military mutiny seen as a failed coup. There were 27 soldiers who kidnapped security and stole weapons, trying to march on Miraflores, who fought with and were apprehended by authorities in the early hours. People in the local area continued the fight, protesting and burning things in the street even as tear gas was deployed. Colectivos killed a non- protesting woman in her own doorway, and five others were injured. According to Venezuelan journalist Francisco Toro for The Washington Post, protests broke out in working-class Caracas neighbourhoods on January 22, which until then had supported Maduro. These resulted in the death of a 16-year-old boy by gunshot. Other protests happened in the large Bol√≠var state, where three people were killed and a statue of Hugo Ch√°vez set alight and broken in half before the head and torso were hung like a trophy from a public bridge.  23 January  23 January 2019 protesters Announced at the 11 January open cabildo, a series of protest marches drawing crowds which were reported by The Economist, The Wall Street Journal editorial board, and Yeshiva World News from hundreds of thousands to millions of Venezuelans, 23 January protests ‚Äì on the anniversary of the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat that overthrew dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez ‚Äì were the flagship event hoping to force Maduro to step down. United States Vice President Mike Pence sent a video of support to the nation on this day. Similarly, Juan Guaid√≥ and his wife Fabiana Rosales sent separate videos to the military of Venezuela, asking for them to \\"not shoot at us\\". Before the protest began, the Venezuelan National Guard used tear gas on gathering crowds at other locations. Another area of the capital was blocked off at Plaza Venezuela, a large main square, with armored vehicles and riot police on hand before protesters arrived. Photographic reports showed that some protests grew violent, resulting in injuries to both protesters and security. By the end of the day, at least 13 people were killed. Cofavic interviewed witnesses who said that special forces killed five youths who had attended protests supporting the opposition. During the evening hours, President of the Constituent Assembly Diosdado Cabello called on Maduro supporters to hold a vigil surrounding Miraflores Palace, though no one attended the event. The Redes Foundation denounced in the Colombian Public Ministry that armed groups made up of National Liberation Army members and FARC dissidents, supported by the Bolivarian National Police and FAES officials, killed two Venezuelans, Eduardo Jos√© Marrero and Luigi √Ångel Guerrero, during a protest in the frontier city of San Crist√≥bal, on T√°chira state. Other protesters were injured during the shooting. A few days later, Michelle Bachelet of the United Nations expressed concern that the violence during the protests could spiral out of control, and requested a UN investigation into the security forces' use of violence. = February = Guaid√≥ at a 2 February demonstration On 2 February opposition demonstrations filled the in Caracas. The theme of the protests was to demand the entry of humanitarian aid into Venezuela, with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans participating to show support for Guaid√≥. According to La Patilla, which provided satellite images, Maduro supporters participated in smaller counter- demonstrations on the same day at the same time. At least 285 were injured and 14 were killed in the clashes on 23 February 2019. = March‚ÄìApril = Guaid√≥ \\"took to the streets\\" to question Maduro's governance during the first two days of a nationwide blackout. According to The New York Times, \\"Maduro did not address the nation and his public silence has fed the tension gripping Caracas\\". Protests against Maduro in Caracas and other cities were called for 9 March, and went on despite the closure of the Caracas Metro and the lack of social media. The rally headed by Guaid√≥, took place near the presidential palace in Miraflores; The Washington Post labeled the manifestation as \\"unusual\\" as it was held in a sector usually associated with Maduro supporters. Heavy police presence blocked the streets with anti-riot shields.  Call for Operation Freedom  Guaid√≥ announced on 16 March that he would embark on a tour of the country to organize committees for what he called \\"Operation Freedom\\" () with the goal to claim the presidential residence, Miraflores Palace. From the first rally in Carabobo state, he said, \\"We will be in each state of Venezuela and for each state we have visited the responsibility will be yours, the leaders, the united, [to] organize ourselves in freedom commands.\\" During the second wave of nationwide blackouts, Guaid√≥ summoned new protests that would precede a decisive massive rally through Caracas. According to Guaid√≥, the goal of the protests is to increase political pressure, but rehearsals are needed as the operation cannot be organized \\"from one day to the next‚Äù. Thousands of Venezuelans participated in a rally on 30 March, against the recurring blackouts. Guaid√≥ toured around Miranda state and Caracas giving several speeches. Anti-riot police used tear gas against several opposition groups in areas where the Maduro supporters were active. Cacerolazos were reported in Caracas after blackouts resumed on Saturday night. The next day, protests against the lack of electricity and water occurred in Caracas and other cities. Some of the protests occurred close to the presidential palace. Maduro called again on the colectivos, asking them to ‚Äúto defend the peace of every barrio, of every block‚Äù. Videos circulated on social media showing colectivos threatening protesters and shooting in the streets; two protesters were shot. On Sunday night, police fired at protesters after they set burning barricades. On 6 April, rallies were called by Juan Guaid√≥ in more than 300 points around the country. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans denounced the lack of electricity and protested against Maduro's presidency, who they hold responsible for the economic crisis. Guaid√≥ met the protesters at the main rally in El Marqu√©s district of Caracas. In Maracaibo, the second largest city of Venezuela, protests were dispersed by police forces with tear gas and rubber bullets. El Nacional reported how tear gas was thrown from helicopters. Two lawmakers were also briefly detained in Maracaibo. The same day, Maduro called a rival march. Thousands of protesters, mostly state workers, met at the center of Caracas. Maduro called for \\"understanding [that] we are in a true electrical emergency, a true national emergency.‚Äù In a public speech on 19 April in Caracas, Guaid√≥ called for a \\"definite end of the usurpation\\" and the \\"largest march in history\\" on 1 May. Guaid√≥ continued to rally around the country for support. Armed forces and Maduro supporters have sometimes used roadblocks to avoid Guaid√≥'s arrival to other cities. On 27 April, Guaid√≥ had to cancel a rally in Barquisimeto because he was unable to get there.  30 April  Guaid√≥ speaking to supporters on 30 April 2019 On 30 April 2019, Leopoldo L√≥pez‚Äîheld under house arrest by the Maduro administration‚Äîwas freed on orders from Guaid√≥. The two men, flanked by members of the Venezuelan armed forces near La Carlota Air Force Base in Caracas, announced an uprising, stating that this was the final phase of Operation Freedom. Guaid√≥ said: \\"People of Venezuela, it is necessary that we go out together to the street, to support the democratic forces and to recover our freedom. Organized and together, mobilize the main military units. People of Caracas, all to La Carlota\\". Maduro was not seen during the day, but he appeared with his Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez on that evening's televised broadcast, and announced he would replace Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera, the Director General of Venezuela's National Intelligence Service, SEBIN, who had broken with Maduro during the uprising. By the end of the day, one protester had died, and L√≥pez was at the Spanish embassy, while 25 military personnel sought asylum in the Brazilian embassy in Caracas. CNN reported that the \\"uprising faltered, having apparently failed to gain the support of senior members of the Venezuelan military\\". = May = Protest of 1 May Thousands to tens of thousands of supporters showed up for demonstrations on 1 May for Guaid√≥. Guaid√≥'s call for the largest march in history did not materialize and his supporters were forced to retreat by security forces using tear gas. Colectivos fired on protesters with live ammunition, and one protester was shot in the head and killed. Human Rights Watch \\"said it believed that security forces fired shotgun pellets at demonstrators and journalists\\". Guaid√≥ acknowledged he had received insufficient military backing, but added that \\"Maduro did not have the support nor the respect of the Armed Forces\\", and called for strikes beginning on 2 May, with the aim of a general strike later in the month. In the pro-Maduro counter rally, most supporters were from the public sector and many were brought from the interior of the country by bus. The Washington Post reported about 500 supporters, while The New York Times reported \\"thousands\\". As of 2 May, there were 230 wounded in the protests, 205 arrests, and four dead. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice issued an arrest warrant for L√≥pez on 2 May, who exited the gates of the Spanish Embassy, to speak with reporters, saying that Maduro's days are numbered. Maduro appeared at an army base to praise the loyalty of the forces. On 4 May, Guaid√≥ organized a peaceful march that was aimed to encourage more FANB defectors. The opposition leader later acknowledged that this march (including previous protests) did not have a sufficient outcome, and that he had \\"overestimated military support\\". During an interview with The Washington Post, Guaid√≥ stated that he would consider a U.S. military intervention should the time arise. On 11 May, Guaid√≥ organized another march in Caracas, with a turnout of around a thousand Venezuelans. During the rally, Guaid√≥ asked his ambassador appointed to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, to start a dialog with the US Southern Command. The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict (OVCS - ), registered 1541 protests in the country during the month of May. As of June, OCVS and Provea have registered 60 protesters killed in rallies in the last five months. = June‚ÄìJuly = Hundreds protested in front of the United Nations office in Caracas during the 22 June, the last day of the visit of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) chief, Michelle Bachelet. Mostly denouncing the human rights abuses carried out by Maduro administration, including extrajudicial killings, political arrests and detained journalists. Gilber Caro‚Äìa National Assembly member who was arrested in April and was released two days before the visit‚Äìjoined the crowd. Protesters invited Bachelet to visit Maracaibo, a city that has collapsed under constant blackouts, fuel shortages and problems with security and health services. One of the chants during the protests included ‚ÄúMaduro is Pinochet‚Äù, referring to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who jailed and tortured Bachelet and members of her family, killing her father. Some protesters held signs calling for the release of Juan Requesens, arrested in August 2018. After three months of cooking gas shortages in La Fr√≠a, T√°chira, a local protest broke out on 2 July. According to witnesses, officers fired at the crowd without warning. The 16-year-old Rufo Chac√≥n, a bystander, was permanently blinded after being hit by over 52 buckshot pellets to his face at point blank range. Two police officers are being investigated for injuring Chac√≥n and attacking other protesters. Guaid√≥ called for nationwide protests to challenge Maduro's military parade on the Fifth of July, the independence day of Venezuela. A few thousands joined the rally in Caracas and marched to the DGCIM headquarters where days later a navy captain Rafael Acosta Ar√©valo was tortured to death. According to Guaid√≥'s team, security forces were present on 15% of the 89 anti-Maduro demonstrations. No clashes were reported. Students, family and members of the clergy were present. The president of the 2017 Constituent National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, held a rally in Caracas in opposition to the OCHR report. His supporters describe the report is inaccurate and biased. A small demonstration was carried out in front of the UN office in Caracas on 15 July, to protest against the DGCIM for their torture against detainees. = November = In November, Guaid√≥ called for the return of the protests. On 16 November, nationwide rallies were carried out with a turnout of thousands of supporters in Caracas and in Maracaibo. \\"Today, tomorrow and Monday ‚Äî we will be in the streets\\", said Guaid√≥ in his speech in the Altamira district in Caracas, mentioning the 18 days of protests that prompted Bolivian president Evo Morales to resign during 2019 Bolivian political crisis. Guaid√≥ guided his supporters to the Bolivian embassy. The rallies were peaceful, anti-riot security forces covered the perimeter without throwing any tear gas canisters. According to reports, protest participation had a low turnout compared to earlier in the year. The Maduro administration organized a counter-protest in the center of Caracas in solidarity to Evo Morales. Thousands of Morales' Venezuelan supporters wearing red shirts arrived in buses. Maduro did not participate and only addressed the crowd through state TV. = December = In a December poll by Venezuelan pollster Meganalisis, those surveyed were asked if they would go to the streets if Guaid√≥ or the National Assembly called for protests. According to respondents, 84.8% would not protest, 10.9% would protest and 4.2% were unsure if they would protest.  Abroad  During the presidential crisis, the United States government ended diplomatic relations with the Nicol√°s Maduro administration and recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as the acting president of Venezuela. On 10 April, after the Maduro administration retired his diplomats from the embassy of Venezuela in Washington, activists from Code Pink, an US anti-war group, received keycards from the diplomats and moved into the building. The group secured all entrances with chains and locks. Carlos Vecchio, Guaid√≥'s ambassador appointed to the US, tried to gain access to the building. The US government considers the embassy as property of Guaid√≥'s interim government. For several days, pro-Guaid√≥ protesters gathered outside the building trying to prevent the US activists from continuing to occupy the building. Clashes in May 2019 between US activists of the group and Venezuelan demonstrators resulted in arrests on both sides. US authorities issued an eviction notice on the group on May 14. The four remaining activists were removed from the embassy by US authorities on 16 May. At the end of July 2019, some members of Code Pink that occupied the embassy visited Venezuela during the Foro de S√£o Paulo. Maduro posed for pictures with the group and rewarded them with gifts, including a book on Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and a replica of Bolivar's sword.

Syria Planum, Solis Planum, Sinai Planum, and Thaumasia Planum are the constituent sectors of the plateau, which sits between 8 km and 4 km above the surrounding southern highlands. It is bounded by vestigial basement terrains that predate the formation of Tharsis. This area has been proposed to be a drainage basin that sourced the floodwaters forming the outflow channels surrounding Chryse Planitia. Context The Thaumasia Plateau lies at the heart of the Tharsis Rise, and is framed to the northwest by the Noctis Labyrinthus fracture zone and the Valles Marineris chasmata (particularly, Ius Chasma, Melas Chasma, and Coprates Chasma, from northwest to northeast). Older Noachian basement crust, likely predating the formation of Tharsis, bound the Thaumasia Plateau to the west (Claritas Rise and the Claritas Fossae), the south (Thaumasia highlands), and the east (Coprates Rise and the Nectaris Fossae). The plateau stretches over 2900 km across the surface of Mars and sits at around a 4 km relief relative to the southern highland terrains immediately surrounding the Tharsis Rise. There are two general provinces composing the Thaumasia Plateau. The northwestern section of the plateau is composed of high plains of Syria Planum, Solis Planum, and Sinai Planum. Thaumasia Planum forms a lower elevation region in the east, abutting the Coprates Rise. In general, the plateau's highest elevation rests in its northwest corner, closest to its hinge between Noctis Labyrinthus and the Claritas Fossae at the approach of Syria Planum to Pavonis Mons. At this location, the relief of the Thaumasia Plateau reaches up to 8 km relative to the surrounding highlands terrain. The topography diminishes to the southeast towards Argyre Planitia. Geology Some authors have suggested that the Thaumasia Plateau was once a large, ancient drainage basin pre-dating the extensive volcanic formation of the Tharsis Rise. At this time, it was likely bounded by the same structures (the Claritas Rise to the west, the Thaumasia highlands to the south, and the Coprates Rise to the east). During Tharsis' Stage 2 (centered over the central section of the Valles Marineris) and Stage 3 volcanotectonic activity (in which tectonic activity became radially centered over the northwestern portion of Syria Planum), significant volcanic activity is understood to have infilled this basin, forming the modern plains terrains observed in the modern period. The burial of this putative drainage basin has been proposed as a source of the catastrophic floodwaters that are hypothesized to have formed the circum-Chryse outflow channels, and the northwestern slope valleys (NSVs) to the northwest of the Tharsis Rise. A number of highly dissected features with summit depressions are present as isolated mountains across the Coprates Rise, the Thaumasia highlands, Daedalia Planum, and Terra Sirenum and are thought to be the ancient edifices of highland volcanic activity. Despite their location and morphology, they have been stratigraphically found to cross-cut younger terrains (ranging from Noachian to early Hesperian age) and thus are probably not the remnant massifs of a putative Tharsis impact basin. These putative ancient volcanoes are morphologically distinct from the Hesperian period Tharsis shield volcanoes; they have been hypothesized to be composed of interbedded layers of lava and pyroclastic rock comparable to terrestrial stratovolcanoes. If this analogy holds, it is possible that these explosions were explosive, and possibly even phreatomagmatic (water ice/magma interaction-driven). These volcanoes are observed to approximate features observed elsewhere on Mars, including Hecates Tholus on the Elysium Rise; Tyrrhena Patera; Hadriaca Patera; and Apollinaris Patera. Later volcanic activity on the Thaumasia Plateau occurred in the Hesperian in association with a profusion of sheet lavas covering Syria Planum, Solis Planum, Sinai Planum, and Thaumasia Planum, emanating from the eastern flanks of the Arsia Mons region. In Thaumasia Planum and against the Coprates Rise, these sheet lavas were observed to onlap underlying plains materials and their associated ridged morphologies. Further volcanism occurred to the south of the Thaumasia highlands in Daedalia Planum. Some authors have analogized the Thaumasia Plateau to instances of intraplate regional-scale plateau uplifts, including the Colorado Plateau (southwestern United States), the Rhenish shield (western Germany), and the Deccan Plateau and Karnataka Plateau (southern India). A proposed mechanism for the formation of the Thaumasia Plateau invokes mantle convection eroding the crustal root underlying the province, rapidly inducing a regional-scale uplift. Erosional valleys in the southern margins of the Thaumasia Plateau are conspicuous and common, and are often sourced from deeply dissected terrains, volcanoes, or large (50 km+ diameter) impact craters (such as Lowell Crater and Voeykov Crater.). Although it is unlikely that precipitation recharged the fluid systems that eroded these valleys, hydrothermal systems have been invoked as a source. The shock of impact cratering events in water-saturated target rock is thought to cause either the catastrophic release of groundwater or the induction of a subsurface hydrothermal system. Alternatively, this heat may be supplied by magmatic intrusions that underlie rifts, or by magmatic piping supplying volcanic surface activity. Intrusive activity of this sort has been proposed to have sourced the Warrego Valles in the Thaumasia Highlands. It has also been proposed in the southern Coprates Rise and in a rift in the southwestern sector of the plateau proper.

Career Ma's debut novel, Severance is described as \\"a biting indictment of late-stage capitalism and a chilling vision of what comes after, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a Marxist screed or a dry Hobbesian thought experiment.\\" Severance is a novel that is partially post-apocalyptic horror, and partially office satire. It follows the novel's narrator in the aftermath of the outbreak of a deadly fever that has killed almost everyone in the US. An earlier chapter from the book won a 2015 Disquiet Literary Prize, the Graywolf Prize. Ma began the novel while working as a fact checker for Playboy, a job she held from 2009 to 2012. It began as a short story, written in her office during her last few months there; after her layoff, it became a novel which she wrote while living on severance pay. She took four years to write it, and finished the novel at Cornell as part of the work in her MFA program. She said that she watched George Romero films while working on Severance, and also The Walking Dead. Ma said she \\"felt pressured to write a traditional immigration novel\\" while in the MFA program at Cornell, but instead decided to write about otherness and alienation via the trope of zombie apocalypse. Ma's main character is, like her, a first generation immigrant. The New York Times review states that \\"laced within its dystopian narrative is an encapsulation of a first-generation immigrant‚Äôs nostalgia for New York.\\" Ma has also published short stories in Granta, Playboy, and the Chicago Reader.Day, Madeline (2018-08-22). \\"Apocalyptic Office Novel: An Interview with Ling Ma\\".

He is credited for reasserting Umayyad authority over the Arab tribesmen who garrisoned the province and ensuring the flow of Khurasan‚Äôs revenues and tribute to the Umayyad treasury in Damascus. Life Abd al- Rahman was an elder son of Ziyad ibn Abihi the Umayyad governor of Iraq and virtual viceroy of the eastern parts of the caliphate. Abd al-Rahman was appointed by Caliph Mu'awiya I as governor of Khurasan, at a time concurrent with his brother Ubayd Allah‚Äôs governorship of Iraq and its eastern dependencies, which included Khurasan.Shaban 1979, p. 39. Abd al-Rahman was tasked with restoring order to the Arab tribesmen who garrisoned the province and bringing them into line with the Umayyads‚Äô plans for eastward expansion. Under the virtual governorship of Aslam ibn Zura‚Äôa, the Arabs had not launched any military expeditions for two years. Abd al-Rahman dispatched one of his commanders, Qays ibn Haytham al-Sulami, to confront Aslam and the latter was consequently imprisoned and forced to surrender 300,000 silver dirhams to the authorities. Abd al-Rahman remained in office for two years until being replaced with his brother Salm in 681 shortly after the accession of Caliph Yazid I. In the course of his governorship, Abd al-Rahman did not launch any expeditions but succeeded in asserting control over the Arab troops of Khurasan and collecting unpaid tribute and revenues on behalf of Damascus. In a testament to his success, he was able to set aside from the collected sums twenty millions dirhams for himself, though this figure is likely an exaggeration by the sources, according to historian Muhammad Abdulhayy Shaban. According to 9th-century historian al-Baladhuri, Abd al-Rahman retired to Basra, where he maintained a daily spending of 1,000 dirhams and died at the age of 100.Al-Tabari, ed.

The interaction between teenaged high school student Nicholas Sandmann and Native American activist Nathan Phillips was captured on photos and videos. Videos released days later showed that initial media reports had omitted key details of the incident. Reports of the incident triggered outrage in the United States, including calls to doxx the students. Outrage arose after many stories falsely portrayed the Catholic students as the aggressors. The students received death threats and the Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, Kentucky temporarily closed due to fears for its students' safety. The short videos of the encounter that were uploaded to social media platforms Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube received millions of views and were widely shared. At first, the anger focused on the students and the school; some of the students were the subject of death threats, and the school received threats of violence. As more videos were released, diverging views about what had really happened polarized Americans. The incident was described by The New York Times as an \\"explosive convergence of race, religion and ideological beliefs\\" and a Vox editorial called it the \\"nation's biggest story\\". In February 2019, the Covington Diocese released the investigation report of a private detective agency hired by the diocese and the high school, stating that the report exonerated the students. Due to media coverage arising from the incident, Covington students have filed a number of multi-million dollar defamation lawsuits against American news agencies. Nicholas Sandmann, the Covington student featured in most media coverage of the incident, has received settlements for undisclosed amounts from both CNN and The Washington Post.CNN settles lawsuit with Nick Sandmann stemming from viral video controversy CNN, January 7, 2020 Incident The stairs of the Lincoln Memorial, the site of the incident, seen in July 2004 The incident took place in the late afternoon of January 18, 2019, on the Plaza of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. at the conclusion of a day of rallies for two groups, Indigenous Peoples March, and the March for Life. The marches had represented entirely separate purposes: raising awareness of indigenous peoples issues and raising awareness of pro-life/abortion issues respectively. For about ten minutes, there was an overlap on the Plaza of a small group from the Indigenous Peoples March and a larger group of students from the all-male Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills, Kentucky, who were gathering at their appointed meeting place at the steps of the Plaza to wait for their buses to return home. Before the students arrived, a group of five Black Hebrew Israelites stood in a row \\"shouting scripture from red books\\" and taunting passers-by.The March For Life also had a permit for First Amendment demonstrations on the National Mall on that day. According to The Cut, CovCath sends an annual delegation of its students to attend the pro-life March For Life in Washington. As the 15- and 16-year-old students began to arrive, the Black Hebrew Israelites began to taunt them directly, and shouted racially combative insults and slurs at them. As more Covington students arrived, and in response to these taunts, the students performed school spirit sports chants, including their version of a MƒÅori haka.A haka is a type of traditional ceremonial dance or challenge in MƒÅori culture. They have been adopted in popular culture, often in sports. One of the Native Americans who was there for the March said that he felt \\"the students were mocking the dance.\\" According to a January 23 New York Times article, Indigenous Peoples March participants said they had interpreted the \\"loud chanting\\" and the size of the group, as well as their MAGA apparel, as \\"aggressive and disruptive to their demonstration\\" which had just concluded. Nathan Phillips, a member of the Omaha tribe who had participated in the March, listened to the chants for what he said was about ten minutes. He said he thought that there was a confrontation between the students and the street preachers that he believed had reached a \\"boiling point\\". In his early press interviews, Phillips accused the Covington students of hate and racism.https://www.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/21/us/nathan-phillips-maga-teens- interview/index.html He later said that he had intended to defuse what he perceived as escalating tension between the students and the preachers. According to the Detroit Free Press, Phillips said, \\"They were in the process of attacking these four black individuals.... These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey, and I stood in between them and so they needed their pounds of flesh and they were looking at me for that.\\" According to CNN's Sara Sidner, two minutes after one of the students took off his shirt to lead the haka, the \\"drum beat of Phillips and another Native American drummer [was audible] in the video\\". They sang the AIM Song, a Native American intertribal song. Phillips and a second Native American, both with ceremonial drums, walked towards the students grouped along the stairs. Sidner said that while some of the students danced to Phillips' drum beat and chanted along with him for a while, they were not \\"enjoying each other's company\\". Soon, Phillips was \\"encircled\\" by about 30 students, \\"many of them white and wearing apparel bearing the slogan of President Trump\\", red baseball hats with the phrase \\"Make America Great Again\\" (MAGA). Phillips continued to beat his ceremonial drum and sing for nearly two minutes as a boy wearing the red MAGA hat chose not to retreat with what some interpreted as a smirk on his face. The student later explained that he smiled because he wanted Phillips to know \\"that I was not going to become angry, intimidated or be provoked into a larger confrontation.\\" =Black Hebrew Israelites= Earlier footage that was released did not include the presence of a group of five Black Hebrew Israelites on the Plaza near the Reflecting Pond, part of a One West Camp offshoot believing in the \\"12 tribes\\" doctrine. They stood in a row \\"shouting scripture from red books\\" and taunting passers-by. According to CNN's Sara Sidner they were \\"taunting ... people of all colors, other black visitors, natives, and a Catholic priest\\" shortly after the end of the Indigenous Peoples March, and before the students arrived on the scene. As the students began to arrive to wait for their bus, the Black Hebrew Israelites began to shout insults directly at them. According to witnesses and video subsequently appearing on social media, the Black Hebrew Israelite men shouted combative and racist slurs at the high school students as well as Native Americans. They called the students \\"a bunch of incest babies\\", future \\"school shooters\\", and \\"dirty ass little crackers\\", and said \\"you give faggots rights\\". Many students reacted by saying things such as \\"whoa\\" and \\"easy\\". The Hebrew Israelites also called a passing black man who tried to disagree with them a \\"coon\\", told indigenous activists that the word Indian means \\"savage\\", and said to a woman who had stopped to argue with them: \\"Where's your husband? Bring your husband. Let me speak to him.\\"  Response  News media started covering the story on the evening of January 18, 2019, in response to the viral spread of initial videos posted to social media. Within days of their first coverage of the incident, many news media outlets had revisited their reports and revised the narrative, as more information became available. (January 21 was the annual commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday). This included longer videos which contextualized the incident, in-depth analyses and statements from spokesmen for the participants directly involved. The media were sharply criticized for basing their initial reporting on social media, particularly the user-generated short videos, that did not include the minutes before and after the incident. These new sources, which included interviews with participants, revealed the chronology of events, showing how the students had become excited by the taunts of the Hebrew Israelites before Phillips came on the scene. Participants at the Indigenous Peoples March posted the first videos of the incident in the evening of Friday, January 18, 2019, following the events. These first videos were roughly only a minute long, when Phillips was drumming, closely encircled by a large group of interested students. They did not include the minutes before and after that contextualized the incident. As described by Vox, the short videos gave the impression \\"that the boys were harassing the Native American elder\\". One of these was a one-minute clip posted by Guam resident Kaya Taitano, a student at the University of the District of Columbia, who was with the small group of other participants at the Memorial late afternoon when the incident took place. She filmed the moment that CNN later described as \\"a smiling young man in a red Make America Great Again hat standing directly in front of the man, who was playing a drum and chanting. Other kids could be seen laughing, jumping around and seemingly making fun of the chants.\\"David Williams and Emanuella Grinberg, 'Teen in confrontation with Native American elder says he was trying to defuse the situation', CNN January 19, 2019, updated January 23, 2019. Taitano uploaded it to Instagram at 7:33 pm, and her video was later reposted that day to Twitter via user \\"2020fight\\" under the title \\"This MAGA loser gleefully bothering a Native American protester at the Indigenous Peoples March\\"; it received over 2.5 million views by January 21. The second video, posted to YouTube by KC Noland, reached two million viewers in two hours Saturday morning, January 19, and over four and a half million by January 24. The first social media video clips were short and focused on this moment, leading to initial harsh criticism of the high school students, who some described as mocking and harassing the elder. Some people affiliated with the March described the boys as appearing threatening due to their numbers, actions, and the \\"Make America Great Again\\" caps and clothing that some wore. By January 20, longer videos had been uploaded. Phillips clarified that it was he who had approached the crowd of students, in what he said was an attempt to defuse what Phillips perceived to be a brewing conflict between the students and a third group of five men who identified as Black Hebrew Israelites who had been taunting the white students with racist and homophobic slurs. Strong reactions to the event prompted an immediate backlash against the school, the students, and their chaperones. The Washington Post described the incident as a \\"tense encounter\\" that \\"prompted outrage\\". One of the featured speakers at the Indigenous Peoples March, Ruth Buffalo, a North Dakota Representative and member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation, said the students' disrespect of what was meant to have been a \\"celebration of all cultures\\" saddened her. She added, \\"The behaviour shown in that video is just a snapshot of what Indigenous people have faced and are continuing to face.\\" Buffalo suggested \\"some kind of meeting with the students to provide education on issues facing Native Americans.\\" House Representative Deb Haaland wrote, \\"The students' display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.\\" Actress Alyssa Milano wrote: ‚ÄúThis is Trump‚Äôs America. And it brought me to tears. What are we teaching our young people? Why is this ok? How is this ok? Please help me understand. Because right now I feel like my heart is living outside of my body‚Äù. Over the next several days statements from a spokesperson for the March, an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, from Nicholas Sandmann, and other officials, offered different perspectives on the incident. In the wake of the widespread sharing of more detailed video clips, media analyses of the videos, and statements, public opinion became polarized, with some saying the students were completely absolved of all wrongdoing and others saying the students were disrespectful of a Native American elder on a day that should have been a celebration of the first Indigenous Peoples March. = Further coverage = Still of a second video Shortly after the event took place, the Covington Catholic communications director released a statement expressing regret that the event had happened. In a joint statement on January 19, the Diocese of Covington and the Covington Catholic High School extended apologies to Phillips, condemned the students' behavior, and said that after they reviewed the situation they would \\"take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.\\" However, in a following letter dated January 25, 2019, the bishop of the Covington Diocese apologized to Sandmann, saying they \\"should not have allowed ourselves to be bullied and pressured into making a statement prematurely\\".Bishop apologizes to teen who faced off with Native American, NBC News, January 26, 2018 According to The New York Times, death threats had been reported by some of the Covington students' families and the school was closed for a day due to threats of violence.\\" On January 20, The New York Times described the encounter as an \\"explosive convergence of race, religion and ideological beliefs‚Äîagainst a national backdrop of political tension... [It] became the latest touch point for racial and political tensions in America, with diverging views about what really had happened.\\" A Vox editorial called it the \\"nation's biggest story\\" and \\"American politics in microcosm\\" based on the competing interpretations, \\"identity-focused politics,\\" and intractable back and forth between left-leaning and right- leaning media organizations \\"despite the inherent uncertainty in the footage itself.\\" As the backlash intensified, the parents of Covington High School junior Nicholas Sandmann, the one CNN described as \\"smiling young man in a red Make America Great Again hat,\\" retained the services of Louisville-based RunSwitch Public Relations, a company that specializes in crisis management. They released a January 21 statement on behalf of Sandmann, in which he said misinformation and \\"outright lies\\" were being spread about the incident. According to him, the situation began when a group of African-American protesters directed insults at the students, and the students responded with school spirit chants. Sandmann said that he was confused when Phillips and other Native Americans subsequently approached him and the other students, and that he tried to remain calm to avoid trouble. He said he \\"did not witness or hear any students chant 'build that wall' or anything hateful or racist at any time.\\" Taitano said she also heard the students chant \\"build that wall\\" and \\"Trump 2020\\", but such chants were not audible in videos reviewed by CNN. The January 21 PR statement denied that the students chanted \\"Build the wall\\". Phillips said that he had heard the students chanting \\"build that wall\\" which was one of the principal concerns of the Indigenous Peoples March. In a brief interview on Twitter, he said \\"This is Indigenous Land you know, we're not supposed to have walls here. We never did for millenniums before anybody else came here we never had walls. We never had a prison. We always took care of our elders and took care of our children. We always provided for them, we taught them right from wrong. I wish I could see that energy in that young mass of young men down there. To put that energy into making this country really great‚Äîhelping those that are hungry...\\" Some others affiliated with the March described the group of boys surrounding Phillips as appearing threatening due to their numbers, actions, and \\"Make America Great Again\\" attire. Alison Lundergan Grimes, Secretary of State of Kentucky, described the scene as \\"horrific\\" and said the students' actions did not reflect Kentucky's values. She wrote, \\"I refuse to shame these children. Instead I turn to the adults that are teaching them and those that are silently letting others promote this behavior. This is not the Kentucky I know and love. We can do better and it starts with better leadership.\\" The Washington Post described the Indigenous Peoples March as \\"meaningful\\", and an example of how Native Americans will not be silenced. The article drew attention to Donald Trump's joking about the Wounded Knee Massacre to mock the senior United States Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren. Vulture writer Erik Abriss, who tweeted that he wanted the Covington students and their parents to die, was fired from his second job at INE Entertainment. Film producer Jack Morrissey, who had suggested the \\"MAGAkids go screaming, hats first, into the woodchipper,\\" later apologized for his \\"fast, profoundly stupid tweet\\". Author and professor at UC Riverside Reza Aslan tweeted about Sandmann: \\"Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid‚Äôs?\\". The tweet was deleted roughly one year later. = Following full video release = A longer hour- and-a-half-long video was made public on Sunday, January 20. The longer video revealed more information about the incident, including the five Hebrew Israelites and their taunting of the students. The New York Times January 22 compilation shows that the whole interaction only lasted ten minutes. In the wake of the publication of the longer video, CNN Business reporter Donie O'Sullivan described 2020fight's video as the one that \\"helped frame the news cycle\\" of the previous days, and characterized the video as a \\"deliberate attempt\\" to mislead and \\"manipulate the public conversation on Twitter\\"‚Äîa violation of Twitter rules. According to Molly McKew, an information warfare researcher, the tweet had been boosted by a network of anonymous Twitter accounts to amplify the story. The newly revealed information of the whole incident shown through the longer videos created confusion in the ongoing reporting: while some still believed the students were partially responsible for poor attitudes, others felt that the students had been maligned by the initial coverage and that several other actors in the event were to blame for the net result. The organizers of the March for Life initially released a statement criticizing the students' \\"reprehensible\\" behavior. But the organizers rescinded the statement on January 20, saying \\"It is clear from new footage and additional accounts that there is more to this story than the original video captured.\\" Chase Iron Eyes, a spokesperson for the March and an attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project who witnessed the incident, said that \\"Conservative people are fearful now‚Äîwith the election to [C]ongress of our first two Native American women, Deb Haaland and Sharice Davids, and so many other powerful women... But yesterday the world saw, whether it was live media or social media, the fight ahead of us can be won‚Äîif we are united.\\" Another march organizer, Nathalie Farfan, said, \\"The good news is, that connection to the sacred may have resonated with some of the Catholic youths. What is not being shown on [the KC Noland February 18 video ] is that the same youth and a few others became emotional because of the power, resilience and love we inherently carry in our DNA. Our day on those steps ended with a round dance, while we chanted, 'We are still here. On January 21, The New York Times report from Covington said that the local community had focused its energy on \\"absolving the students of any wrongdoing\\" in the incident, having begun \\"to see itself as facing a politically motivated siege\\". Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie wrote that after watching videos from four different cameras he believed the media had misrepresented the incident, and that \\"In the context of everything that was going on (which the media hasn't shown) the parents and mentors of these boys should be proud, not ashamed, of their kids' behavior.\\" The House Intelligence Committee on January 22 asked Twitter to provide information on the reason why the first video went viral.Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel, 'Who Posted Viral Video of Covington Students and Protester? Congress Wants to Know', The New York Times January 23, 2019. On January 22, shortly after tweeting it, Kathy Griffin deleted a Twitter message in which she accused Covington basketball players making a 3-pointer sign of \\"throwing up the new nazi sign\\". The same day Jim Carrey tweeted an art work labeling the Covington students as \\"baby snakes\\". In a January 22 tweet, President Trump said the Covington students \\"have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be.\\" After several conflicting media interviews were given by Nathan Phillips, NBC's Savannah Guthrie interviewed Covington High School junior Nicholas Sandmann, airing on the Today Show on the morning of January 23. While Sandmann did not feel a need to apologize for his actions, he expressed respect for Phillips and a desire to talk to him. In hindsight, he wished that he had simply walked away.Janelle Griffith, 'Covington Catholic student in D.C. march video says he wishes had 'avoided the whole thing'', NBCNews.com January 23, 2019. In his interview with NBC, Phillips said that while \\"Sandmann owes many people an apology\\", as he continues to believe the \\"students were 'mocking' Native Americans, and Sandmann 'was the leader of that, he forgives those involved. Phillips also acknowledged that both of them had received death threats since the incident. Guthrie was criticized for giving Sandmann a national platform and for asking Sandmann if he should apologize to Phillips.Joe Concha, 'NBC's Guthrie slammed by left, right over interview with Covington student Sandmann', The Hill January 23, 2019. On January 23, CNN's Kirsten Powers deleted her Twitter app after she was criticized and, in her own words, \\"harassed\\" on Twitter after stating a day prior that \\"watching all the videos (which I did) does not change the fundamental problem: the boys disrespecting an Indigenous elder.\\"Joe Concha, 'CNN's Powers deletes Twitter app after harassment claim over Covington criticism', The Hill January 23, 2019. The same day, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders gave a statement saying, \\"the idea that anybody could take joy in the destruction of young kids is absolutely outrageous to me\\"; her remarks were criticized, with critics pointing to the Trump administration's family separation policy.  Analysis of media coverage  The news media has been criticized for how it covered the incident, specifically for their initial reporting of the story based on various social media posts without fully investigating what occurred and subsequently fueling controversy and outrage over the incident.Robby Soave, 'The Media Wildly Mischaracterized That Video of Covington Catholic Students Confronting a Native American Veteran', Reason January 20, 2019. The media began to cover the story after it received a massive amount of attention on social media. At first, most media coverage neglected to provide key details to the story. Two days later, after a longer video was released, media outlets began to withdraw from their initial analysis and made edits clarifying the changes. For example, CNN titled an article \\"Teens in Make America Great Again hats taunted a Native American elder at the Lincoln Memorial\\", but upon revision, the new headline read \\"Teen in confrontation with Native American elder says he was trying to defuse the situation\\". The New York Times's original coverage was titled \\"Boys in ‚ÄòMake America Great Again‚Äô Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March\\" before following up the next day with \\"Fuller Picture Emerges of Viral Video of Native American Man and Catholic Students\\". Some organizations did not change their original writings, but added a notice directing users to newer articles with a more complete account.

After Sandmann's lawyers amended the complaint, the suit was reopened on October 28, 2019. The judge stood by his earlier decision that 30 of the Post's 33 statements targeted by the complaint were not libelous, but agreed that a further review was required for three statements that \\"state that (Sandmann) 'blocked' Nathan Phillips and 'would not allow him to retreat'\\".

The book opposed the partition of India and in it Madani advocated for \\"the ideal of a 'composite nationalism' within an united India, which he thought would be more conducive to the spread and prosperity of his community over the entire subcontinent than any religious partition.\\" The book was translated into English in 2005 by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind. The idea of composite nationalism was and remains influential among the Muslims living in British India, with the majority of them staying in India despite the partition, rather than migrating to the areas that separated to become Pakistan.  Arguments  Asgar Ali summarized a key point of Muttahida Qaumiyat Aur Islam: Composite Nationalism and Islam put forth the idea that different religions do not constitute different nationalities. Rather, \\"Nationality is co-terminus with territory and both believers and non-believers in Islam can share the same territory and hence the same nationality. Nations, the book argued, are formed on the basis of \\"a common motherland, language, ethnicity or colour, which brings together Muslims and non-Muslims sharing one or more of these attributes in common.\\" The proposition for a partition of India, therefore, did not have any religious justification, but was \\"purely political.\\" The text emphasized that those who wished to partition India were among the secular elite, rather than religious leaders. Composite Nationalism and Islam opines that the reason the separatists wished to create a new state is because they \\"were aspiring for power and hence wanted their exclusive domain\\". Composite Nationalism and Islam therefore urged its readers to join the Indian National Congress, as its aims were in accordance with Islamic teaching. It implored Muslims not to join the pro-separatist All India Muslim League, which it called hypocritical. The book emphasized that keeping India united would allow Muslims to illumine non- Muslims with what they saw as the true faith.  Influence  The ideas presented in Composite Nationalism and Islam were upheld by the Deobandi Ulema, whose \\"priority was an independent India where they could practice Islam without fear or hindrance.\\" Madani traveled across British India spreading the idea of composite nationalism, which opposed the concept of a partition of India. While he was doing this, members of the pro-separatist Muslim League tried to intimidate Madani and disturb his rallies. The idea of composite nationalism was nevertheless influential among the Muslims living in British India, with the majority of them staying in India after the partition, rather than migrating to the areas that separated to become Pakistan.

She was the secretary and later president of the radical bourgeois Comitato lombardo pro suffragio (Lombard Suffrage Committee) and member of the Italian branch of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). One of the leaders of the Italian women's suffrage campaigns, she was the only Italian woman to serve in her era on the board of the IWSA and was as a delegate to the Inter-Allied Women's Conference of 1919. Early life Margherita Ancona was born, as a twin with her sister Luisa, on 3 September 1881 in Palermo, on the island of Sicily in the Kingdom of Italy to Maria (n√©e Basevi) and Camillo Ancona. Her family were of Jewish heritage. After attending gymnasium studying the classics in Messina in 1901, the twins relocated to Milan to further their education and became some of the first women graduates in Italy. Luisa was the second woman to enter university studies in Italy, behind Maria Montessori, and would become an eye doctor. Career Ancona became a teacher of letters at the and was a strong advocate for women's suffrage, belonging to the Comitato Pro-Voto Milanese (Milanese Pro-Voting Committee). Lombardy was the center of the early feminist movement in Italy, as after the Italian unification, women who had previously had the right to vote under Austrian rule of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, lost their enfranchisement. In 1906, when Montessori wrote a proclamation favoring women's suffrage, committees in favor sprung up throughout the country, Maria Cabrini, Carlotta Clerici, , Linda Malnati, and Nina Rignano were some of the founding members of the Comitato Pro-Voto Milanese, for which Ancona would become secretary. She also joined the Associazione per la donna (Association for Women), attending the conference hosted by the organization in Rome in October 1917, where she presented a paper on the state of suffrage in Italy. Ancona believed that the vote was essential for women to attain social and economic reforms and expressed her views in the January 1919 edition of the journal Attivit√† femminile sociale (Women's Social Activity). In February 1919, she attended the Inter-Allied Women's Conference hosted in Paris, which opened on the 10th, to develop women's topics for the Paris Peace Conference. By June 1919, she was serving as president of the Lombard Suffrage Committee and urging lawmakers to amend the law on women's emancipation. Publishing articles in the journal Voce nuova (New Voice), Ancona espoused a liberal suffragism, which rejected nationalism and racism. When the paper began publishing articles by Teresa Labriola, a feminist in favor of Italian national expansion and racial superiority, Ancona withdrew from further collaboration with the publication. Ancona was the opening speaker of the Suffrage Conference hosted in Milan between 23 and 29 April 1920, which called together prominent men from all of Italy's political parties to discuss women's enfranchisement. At the Eighth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, hosted in June 1920 in Geneva, Ancona became the first Italian woman elected to serve on the IWSA board. That same year, when the International Federation of University Women was founded in London, she pressed for the Italians to organize a chapter. The first three organizational meetings were held in Rome, another in 1922 and by 1923, first federal assembly of the ' (Federation of Italian Women Graduates and Diplomates) was held and bylaws adopted. The group was an affiliate of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Donne Italiane (National Council of Italian Women) and worked both to promote women's professionalism and to open educational and employment opportunities to women. In 1923, Ancona was elected to the post of vice president on the international board and was the only Italian woman to have held such a high post in the IWSA. Her influence and regular correspondence on the vigorous campaign for enfranchisement in Italy, led to the selection of Rome as host for the 9th IWSA Conference. Ancona and Alice Schiavoni Bosio of the Federazione Nazionale Pro-Suffragio Femminile (National Federation in favor of Women's Suffrage) in Rome opened the conference of 2,000 women and welcomed Benito Mussolini, who was in attendance. She was re-elected to the international board of the IWSA in 1924, serving with Germaine Malaterre- Sellier, Franti≈°ka Plam√≠nkov√°, and Adela Schreiber, among others. After conflicts arose between Ancona and Ada Sacchi Simonetti, in 1928, who became president of the Federazione Nazionale pro Suffragio (National Federation in favor of Suffrage) which would become the Federazione Italiana per il Suffragio e i Diritti delle Donne (Italian Federation for Suffrage and Women's Rights), Ancona withdrew from active participation in the struggle for the vote. Later life and death Through 1938, Ancona taught Latin and Greek in the upper grades at the Liceo Cesare Beccaria. Her family was affected by Italian racial laws, passed in that year by the Fascist regime and little else is known of her history. She died in Milan in 1966.

Early life and education  Gertrud Caspari was born in Chemnitz in 1873 as the fourth of five children of the merchant Robert Caspari. After the death of her father in 1888, the family moved to Dresden in 1894. Gertrud Caspari worked as a governess for a year, and then studied at the Dresden School of Applied Arts from 1895 to 1898, training to be a teacher. However, she fell seriously ill in 1897 from Graves' disease, which kept her bedridden for many years. It was during that time that she had the idea for a first illustrated children's book. Career  Her first picture book appeared in 1903 under the title The Living Toy. The following year, she successfully participated in the Arts and Crafts Exhibition in Leipzig, where she showed frieze designs in appliqu√©. She regularly received orders to illustrate children's books, and also illustrated textbooks and songbooks. Gertrud Caspari, 'Wind', Children's Humor (1906) Gertrud Caspari, Our Child is King! (1915) In 1906, she and her brother Walther Caspari, who worked as a graphic designer for political magazines, were commissioned by the Leipzig teacher's association to create the picture book Kinderhumor f√ºr Auge und Ohr (Children's Humor for Eye and Ear). The book was published in 1906 by Verlag Alfred Hahn in Leipzig and established a 40-year cooperation between the publisher and Gertrud Caspari. The author Adolf Holst wrote verses for many of the illustrations. Her brother Walther died in 1913 at the age of 44, leaving Gertrud Caspari to carry on the work alone. The following year she moved from one part of Dresden, B√ºhlau, to another, Klotzsche, where she lived until the end of the Second World War. During the time of Nazi Germany, she illustrated educational books for the Ministry of Propaganda. After the war, she was charged with collaboration. Caspari lost her apartment in Klotzsche and spent her last years in L√∂√ünitz in the Erzgebirge, where she lived in poverty. Caspari published over 50 of her own children's books with illustrations, and illustrated more than 20 other works by other authors. In addition, she designed postcards, games, calendars and even porcelain figures. In 1927, she created murals and stained glass windows for a children's rest home in Jet≈ôichovice (German: Dittersbach) in the district of Tetschen (now in the Czech Republic). Her illustrations of baby animals and their parents formed the basis of early arithmetic for many children in the 1920s. Caspari is considered the creator of a \\"modern toddler style\\", which is also referred to as \\"Caspari style\\". \\"Her painting is characterized by large areas, often monochrome backgrounds, simple perspectives, sharp contours, simple figures and a bright-warm color.\\" She also drew scenes of her Saxon homeland.

It is also known as the Sunda white-eye. It is found on the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali. It lives in forest, in Java it is typically found in altitudes from , and sometimes lower than that. This species was formerly treated as a subspecies of the Indian white-eye (previously the Oriental white-eye, Zosterops palpebrosus) but based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2018, it was promoted to species rank. In western Java its range overlaps with the Indian white-eye subspecies buxtoni, which is a recent colonist from Sumatra. The two species interbreed where they co-occur. The Sangkar white-eye is similar in plumage to the Indian white-eye, but differs in having much yellower plumage, particularly the underparts which are entirely yellow instead of grey. It forages for insects, and favours the introduced Sesbania grandiflora when hunting. The breeding season for the Sangkar white-eye is from January to October, with a peak in May and June.

The term posits the primacy of storytelling over, for example, language or reasoning, in differentiating Homo sapiens from other species of the genus Homo. History Scholarly use of the term may originate with the German ethnologist Kurt Ranke in a paper published in 1967.Karl Ranke, 'Kategorienprobleme der Volksprosa', Fabula, 9(1-3) (1967), 4‚Äì12 (p. 6) ; Kurt Ranke, 'Problems of Categories in Folk Prose', trans. by Carl Lindahl, Folklore Forum 14(1) (1981), 1-17 (p. 5).Cf.

Geburtstag, ed. by Rolf Wilhelm Brednich (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2009), pp. 59-70 (p. 59) . Another prominent coining of the term, apparently independent of Ranke's, was by the communications theorist Walter R. Fisher, who is often credited with originating the term.Rhodes, C. and Brown, A. D. (2005) Narrative, organizations and research.

Fisher wrote that 'many different root metaphors have been put forth to represent the essential nature of human beings: homo faber, homo economicous, homo politicus, homo sociologicus, \\"psychological man\\", \\"ecclesiastical man\\", homo sapiens, and, of course, \\"rational man\\". I now propose homo narrans to be added to the list.'Walter R. Fisher, 'Narration as a Human Communication paradigm: The Case of Public Moral Argument', Communication Monographs, 51 (1984), 1-20 (p. 6) repr. in Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader, ed. by John Louis Lucaites, Celeste Michelle Condit, and Sally Caudill (New York: The Guilford Press, 1999) pp. 265-87 (p. 270)].Cf.

The album had a modestly different sound than the band's previous releases, somewhat due to the fact that long-time drummer (and original Tullycraft member) Jeff Fell, did not make an appearance on the album, but also because of the new approach the members of the band took to the recording process. Much of the album was improvised during the recording sessions. This was an untried approach for Tullycraft. Equipped with lyrics and vocal melodies (provided by Tollefson) the band composed many of the new songs from the ground up in the studio.

It uses a pair of luminous organs to camouflage itself from predators at night. Description In this species, females grow larger than males. The maximum mantle length is about , the width of the mantle being about 30% of the length. The fins are rounded and the posterior of the mantle is heart-shaped. The eight arms are short and there are rings of suckers on each arm, each sucker having four to seven teeth. The male has the fourth left arm hectocotylised over its entire length. The two tentacles are short and robust, with broad paddle-shaped clubs. There are two photophores on the underside of the ink sac. Populations in the north of the range differ from those in the south in the arrangement of the suckers on the male's right ventral arms. This squid has a colourless cuticle with a pattern of orange, black and brown dots. Distribution and habitat Uroteuthis noctiluca is found in shallow waters on the eastern coast of Australia, its range extending from southern Queensland to Tasmania. It is often in seagrass meadows at a maximum depth of about . Biology This small squid is short-lived, surviving for about seventy days in tropical waters but rather longer than this in the temperate south of its range. It is tolerant of low salinity and is often found in brackish water, bays and estuaries. It is active at night, foraging for crustaceans and small fish. The photophores on its underside can be partially revealed to provide camouflage at night by concealing the squid's silhouette from below, the light output being varied to match the moonlight or starlight. The light organs of squid contain luminescent bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae; a number of different species of bacteria are involved, and some squid species host multiple strains. Little is known of the reproductive behaviour of this squid. The male's specially adapted hectocotylis arm is likely to be used to deposit a spermatophore in the female's mantle, or to clear out sperm from a previous mating.

He was a founding member of the Convention People's Party and minister of state in the first republic. He was briefly resident minister of Ghana in Guinea and also resident minister of Ghana in Congo. Early life and education Welbeck was born at Cape Coast on 25 September 1915 to Madam Adwoa Twi and Nomo Welbeck who migrated to Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. His father was of Ewe and Ga descent and his mother was Fanti, Welbeck identified as a Fanti, a Ga and also an Ewe however, due to Akan (of which Fantis constitute) customs and tradition which places more emphasis on one's maternal background, Welbeck was a Fanti from Cape Coast. His father died in a house fire at Abidjan where the family resided. Welbeck was sleeping in the same room with his father. His grandmother first saw the fire and blew the alarm. His father on hearing the alarm, picked him up and took him to a safe place. He then went back to the flaming house to rescue another child by throwing it out of the window into safety but he was overcome by the flames and could not find the door to get out of the burning house. Welbeck was too young to know his father. His mother was a bead trader. She decided to stay after her husband's death, she had established herself as a successful bead trader in Abidjan. Welbeck had his early education at a school in Abidjan. The French language being the medium of communication in schools in the area, Welbeck became well versed in the French language. Welbeck's mother decided to send Welbeck to his native Gold Coast to stay with his paternal uncle; Mr. Joseph Mensah Attabrah. He lived with his family in Swedru where he continued schooling, this time in the English Language. He sat for his standard seven school leaving certificate in 1932 and entered Wesley College in 1933 to train as a teacher. Career and politics He qualified as a teacher in 1936. He taught in many institutions, the last school he was posted to before he brought his teaching career to a close was Takoradi Methodist School. He entered politics before quitting the teaching profession. He had joined the newly formed United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC); a political party that had begun as a movement to usher the Gold Coast into political independence. In 1949 he was appointed the secretary to the Local Education Committee. That same year, he decided to quit teaching completely to focus on politics. Kwame Nkrumah left the UGCC to form the Convention People's Party(CPP) on 12 June 1949 and Welbeck joined the party that same day as one of its founding members. A year later, he was arrested during an unrest which followed Nkrumah's declaration of \\"Positive Action Without Violence.\\" He was tried and charged with sedition leading to his 12-month incarceration. This propelled his political career as he was viewed as a hero after his release. In 1951 he was appointed the national propaganda secretary for the CPP. After the death of Kwesi Plange in 1953 he was selected by his party the CPP to stand elections in his home town Cape Coast as a municipal member of the legislative assembly. He contested for the Cape Coast seat with Amponsah Dadzie of the United Party. Welbeck won the election but the results were contested by his opponent; Amponsah Dadzie. The general elections for Cape Coast was rescheduled for 1954 and this time Welbeck was elected and he kept the seat without any court proceedings. That same year he was appointed minister for works. He was elected in office in 1956 and in 1958 he was appointed a resident minister to Guinea. In 1960 he was retained in parliament and appointed minister of state for Defence. That same year he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary and Ambassador Extraordinary posted to Congo as resident minister representing Ghana. He was returned to Ghana in November 1960 after his residence was besieged by the Congo military for allegedly plotting with the then deposed Patrice Lumumba against Mobutu's regime. In September 1962, he became acting executive secretary of the CPP due to Hugh Horatio Coffie Crabbe's detention. He was appointed Executive Secretary of the party in 1963 while Nkrumah was the general secretary. In 1965 Welbeck was appointed Minister of information (a non cabinet post) and party propaganda secretary. Personal life He was the great grandson of Philip Quaque of Cape Coast. He first married Ms. Sarah Andrews and they had a daughter together. The marriage lasted from 1942 to 1950. He married Ms. Esther Quarm in 1954. Welbeck's hobbies included lawn tennis and stamps collection. Death Welbeck died in 1972 after a protracted illness.

Early years  When Anna was four years old, her mother Jadwiga Stankiewicz left her and her father, wealthy industrialist Stanis≈Çaw Wilhelm Lilpop, for the pianist J√≥zef ≈öliwi≈Ñski. From then on, her father and aunt Aniela Pilawitz brought her up, while her mother was denied any contact with Anna. From 1915 to 1918, she stayed with her father in Russia, particularly in Moscow and Kiev. Her time in Russia contributed to the formation of her literary talent as she studied at the Moscow Polish University, learned foreign languages, and became interested in music and theater. In Russia, she acquired knowledge about the work of Scriabin, who later became her favorite composer and whose music she would promote in Poland by organizing his concerts in Warsaw.  Marriage  Anna Iwaszkiewicz with a daughter (1924) On September 12, 1922, after overcoming the initial resistance of her father, she married poet Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz. For this marriage, she broke off an engagement to Prince Krzysztof Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, arranged several years earlier. Through her marriage she gained the opportunity to establish contacts with the artistic and literary community. She gave birth to daughters: Maria and Teresa.  Literary activity  Anna published essays, mainly on the works of Marcel Proust, Joseph Conrad and Thomas Mann (partly under a pseudonym). She translated French literature (Marcel Proust, Michel Butor, Alain-Fournier, Jules Verne) and English-language literature (Thomas Marton and Alfred North Whitehead). At the end of her life, she published the book Nasze zwierzƒôta (Our Animals) (1978). Her most outstanding work is Dzienniki i wspomnienia (Diaries and Memoirs) (published in 2000), containing valuable descriptions of life in the interwar period and memories of, among others, Karol Szymanowski, a relative of her husband.  Personality  Anna and Jaros≈Çaw's grave in Brwin√≥w Anna was a sensitive and difficult person. Her husband did not hide his sexual orientation or male lovers from her, while Anna herself was bisexual. Nonetheless, the couple considered their marriage happy and successful. Anna had mental health issues, including depression. She coped with it by being a devoted Catholic. Anna wrote for journals for many years, which demonstrate her literary talent and personality. During the German occupation, she helped Polish Jews by organizing their escape from the Ghetto and hiding them in Stawisko. For this activity, on January 21, 1988, she and her husband were honored with the award of Righteous Among the Nations.
