The center is a member of the Council of American Overseas Research Centers. General information The American offices of the school, located at 6-8 Charlton St, Princeton, New Jersey Founded in 1892, the ASCSA is the most significant resource in Greece for American scholars in the fields of ancient and post-classical studies in Greek language, literature, history, archaeology, philosophy, and art. The mission of the School is to advance knowledge of Greece in all periods, as well as other areas of the classical world, by training young scholars, sponsoring and promoting archaeological fieldwork, providing resources for scholarly work, and disseminating research. The ASCSA is also charged by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism with primary responsibility for all American archaeological research, and seeks to support the investigation, preservation, and presentation of Greece's cultural heritage. The School offers two major research libraries: the Blegen Library, with 94,000 volumes dedicated to the ancient Mediterranean world; and the Gennadius Library, with over 120,000 volumes and archives devoted to post-classical Hellenic civilization and, more broadly, the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. The School also sponsors excavations and provides centers for advanced research in archaeological and related topics at its excavations in the Athenian Agora and Ancient Corinth, and it houses an archaeological laboratory (the Wiener Laboratory) at the main building complex in Athens. Resources and Services The ASCSA offers graduate students enrolled in member universities an unparalleled immersion into the sites and monuments of Greek civilization. Although there are many activities and programs at the School, its core programs are: The Academic Year or 'Regular' Program, which runs from early September to early June, offers advanced graduate students from a variety of fields an intensive survey of the art, archaeology, history, and topography of Greece, from antiquity to the present. The program for Regular Members is an integrated participatory program over nine months. Regular Members are expected to be in attendance for the full nine-month program. Students receive comprehensive training through visits to the principal archaeological sites and museums of Greece as well as in seminars led by resident and visiting scholars. They also take part in the training program at the Corinth excavations. The School accepts 15 to 20 students in this program. The Summer Sessions, which run for two six-week periods each, are open to North American graduate and advanced undergraduate students and to high school and college instructors of classics and related fields. In these sessions, the School condenses its academic year program into an intensive introduction to the sites, museums, and monuments of Greece. The Summer programs are open to 20 participants each session. The School welcomes scholars to its libraries year- round for research. In addition, the School is a recognized leader in digital resources, providing an ever-expanding collection of books, journals, photographs, excavation notebooks, personal papers, maps, and scientific data sets online. Archaeological fieldwork Finds from the ASCSA excavations on the Athenian Agora are displayed in the reconstructed Stoa of Attalos. =ASCSA Projects= Throughout its existence, the ASCSA has been involved in a large number of archaeological projects, as well as a major programme of primary archaeological publications. It is responsible for two of the most important archaeological sites in Greece, the Athenian Agora and Ancient Corinth. The Corinth Excavations commenced in 1896 and have continued to present day with little interruption, and the Athenian Agora excavations first broke ground in 1932. At both sites, the ASCSA operates important museums and extensive facilities for the study of the archaeological record. Excavation records and artifacts are made available to wider audiences via ASCSA.net =ASCSA Affiliated Projects= Other archaeological projects with ASCSA involvement, past and present, include surveys in the Southern Argolid, in Messenia and at Vrokastro (Crete) and excavations at Olynthus (Greek Macedonia), Samothrace (North Aegean), the islet of Mitrou (Central Greece), Halai (Phthiotis), Isthmia, Kenchreai, Nemea, Sicyon (all in Corinthia), Lerna, Argos, Franchthi cave and Halieis (Argolid), Mt. Lykaion (Acadia), Nichoria and the Palace of Nestor at Pylos (Messenia), Haghia Irini (Keos), as well as Azoria, Mochlos, Gournia, Kavousi and Kommos on Crete. Publications ASCSA publishes the peer-reviewed journal Hesperia quarterly as well as monographs for final reports of archaeological fieldwork conducted under School auspices, supplements to Hesperia, Gennadeion monographs; and miscellaneous volumes relating to the work of the School. These books range in format from large hardbacks to slim paperback guides. List of Directors * William W. Goodwin (1882 to 1883); first director * Lewis R. Packard (1883 to 1884) * Frank B.

Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and red meat with rice a typical accompaniment. Chillies, curry leaves, coconut, mustard seeds, turmeric, tamarind, and asafoetida are all frequently used. Kerala is known as the \\"Land of Spices\\" because it traded spices with Europe as well as with many ancient civilizations with the oldest historical records of the Sumerians from 3000 BCE.Striving for sustainability, environmental stress and democratic initiatives in Kerala, p. 79; , Srikumar Chattopadhyay, Richard W. Franke; Year: 2006. Historical and cultural influences In addition to historical diversity, cultural influences, particularly the large percentages of Muslims and Christians, have also contributed unique dishes and styles to Kerala cuisine, especially non-vegetarian dishes. The meat eating habits of the people were historically limited by religious taboos. Brahmins eschew non vegetarian items. However, most modern-day Hindus do not observe any dietary taboos, except a few of those belonging to upper castes who do not consume beef or pork.Social mobility in Kerala Kanjirathara Chandy Alexander Most Muslims do not eat pork and other items forbidden by Islamic law. Alcohol is available in Kerala in many hotels and over a thousand bars and liquor stores, but state authorities plan to close the vast majority of these outlets in a ten-year plan, beginning in 2014, to combat alcoholism. Overview A restaurant menu in Kerala One of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala Sadya, which is an elaborate banquet prepared for festivals and ceremonies. A full-course Sadya, which consists of rice with about twenty different accompaniments and desserts is the ceremonial meal of Kerala eaten usually on celebratory occasions including marriages, Onam and Vishu. It is served on a plantain leaf. Because of its rich trading heritage, over time various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with foreign dishes to adapt them to local tastes. Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring. Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca. It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food. Having been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Kerala also has a variety of breakfast dishes like idli, dosa, appam, idiyappam, puttu, and pathiri. Hindu cuisine A typical sadya, where banana leaves are used as plates Sadya items ready to be served. Clockwise from top: paayasam, bitter gourd thoran, aviyal, kaalan, lime pickle, sambar, buttermilk with boiled rice in center The vast majority of Kerala's Hindus, except certain communities and ovo-lacto vegetarians, eat fish, and chicken. Some communities, on the other hand, are famed for their vegetarian cuisine consisting of milk and dairy-based dishes, especially various varieties of sambar and rasam. In most Kerala households, a typical meal consists of rice, fish, and vegetables. Beef (Buffalo), contrary to the outlook of the remaining Indian Hindu society, also plays a prominent role in Kerala cuisine. The meat is featured in Hindu, Christian and Islamic communities of Kerala. =Sadya= Sadya is a traditional rice and vegetable curry platter in banana leaf. It is served on auspicious days in Kerala cuisine. Christian cuisine Kozhukkatta is prepared by Saint Thomas Christians on the Saturday prior to Palm Sunday and the day is hence called Kozhukatta Saturday. Christians especially Mar Thoma Nasranis (St Thomas Christians), of Kerala have their own cuisine which is a blend of Indian, Middle Eastern and Western styles and flavours of cooking. Particularly well- developed are the snacks and savouries of Christians such as \\"achappam\\" and \\"kuzhalappam\\". A favourite dish of Kerala Christians is \\"mappas\\", or chicken stew. For this dish, chicken, potatoes and onions are simmered gently in a creamy white sauce flavoured with black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green chillies, lime juice, shallots and coconut milk. In Central Kerala this is made only with Beef or lamb, the usage of Chicken in stew is very rare.Marks, Gil (2010), Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley and sons Lamb and duck can replace chicken in the stew recipe. Biriyani (mutton, chicken, Beef, lamb or prawn) made as ‚Äòdum‚Äô tops the list of delicacies. Thalassery Biriyani the only version of biriyani in Kerala. Other dishes include piralen (chicken stir- fries), meat thoran (dry curry with shredded coconut), sardine and duck curries, and meen molee (spicy stewed fish). This is eaten with parotta or appam. \\"Meen Mulakittathu\\" or \\"Meen vevichathu\\" (fish in fiery red chilly sauce) is another favourite item. \\"Pidi\\", a type of rice dumplings in thick gravy, is a famous Christian delicacy. \\"Pidi\\" is paired best with chicken curry. In addition to chicken and fish, Christians along with a section of Hindus and all Muslims in Kerala eat red meat. \\"Irachi ularthiathu\\" is a beef dish cooked with spices. Additionally among the Anglo Indian and Latin Communities, they have their own dishes in which we can see a lot of Portuguese influence. Notable ones include Vindaloo( sometimes Vindali) which is a beef based red dish made with chillies and Vinegar. It has a goan counterpart with similar name. Vivinga is a coconut cake, made with wheat flour, coconut and spices. Popular across coastal regions of Ernakulam and Alapuzha. The millet and wheat based Lethiri which is similar to Idiyapam is also another major delicacy. Kappa biriyani is another delicacy among the Christians of Central kerala. Mainly among Christians of Coastal Ernakulam and Alapuzha, the black duck curry is one among the popular dishes. It is made with a liberal amount of black pepper and coconut milk with the accompaniment of pieces of big cuts of Duck meat. Muslim cuisine Muslim cuisine or Mappila cuisine is a blend of traditional Kerala, Persian and Arab food culture. This confluence of culinary cultures is best seen in the preparation of most dishes. Kallummakkaya (mussels) curry, erachi puttu (erachi means meat), parottas (soft flatbread), pathiris (a type of rice pancake) and ghee rice are some of the other specialties. The characteristic use of spices is the hallmark of Mappila cuisine. spices like black pepper, cardamom and clove are used profusely. The snacks include unnakkaya (deep-fried, boiled ripe banana paste covering a mixture of cashew, raisins and sugar), pazham nirachathu (ripe banana filled with coconut grating, molasses or sugar), muttamala made of eggs, chattipathiri, a dessert made of flour, like baked, layered chappatis with rich filling, arikadukka and so on Gallery File:Sadhya DSW.jpgSadhya File:Rice Puttu with Gram Curry.jpgPuttu with gram curry File:Appam with kadala curry from kerala.jpgAppam served with chickpea curry from Kerala File:Idiyappam with Egg Masala Curry.jpgIdiyappam with Egg Masala Curry File:Karimeen Pappas.JPGthumbKarimeen Pappas, Green chromide Fish baked in banana leaf File:Pathiri.jpgPathiri File:Unnakai (‡¥â‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥Ø‡µç‚Äå).jpgUnnakai is a spindle shaped sweet dessert made chiefly of plantain.

Owing to his concern about the threat of nuclear war, he played a leading role in the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. He also wrote major studies of American federalism, in which he criticized the idea that the federal, state, and local governments operated distinctly from one another. He argued that the governments resembled a marble cake where the different flavors blended together rather than remaining in layers. This concept of cooperative federalism was distinct from dual federalism. Works *Americans Betrayed: Politics and the Japanese Evacuation, 1949.

They currently play in the at their home ground of Alvington Lane. The club is affiliated to the Somerset County FA. History The club was founded in 1939, but the second world war prevented regular competitive football. After the war though in 1946, the club was able to field two sides, one Yeovil and District League team, and one youth side. However the club did not achieve any success until the Yeovil League charity cup win in the 1962/63. In 1964‚Äì65 the club withdrew from the Yeovil and District League due to loss of players to Yeovil Town. The situation was short-lived, and the club reformed under the guidance of Dave Topping in the Yeovil League in the 1966‚Äì67 season with the intention of entering senior football as soon as possible. This happened the following year when the club was elected to the Somerset Senior League. In its second year since reformation the club, now fielding a reserve side, had an exceptional year. The Somerset Senior League was won with a record 70 points (2 points for a win), with only one defeat. The Somerset Charity cup was won, and also the Yeovil Hospital cup against Bristol City. Senior league runners up was to follow in the next two seasons. In 1974 the club, known at that time as Westland-Yeovil, realised their ambition by gaining admittance to the Western Football League on a semi professional basis under the management of Roy Lambden. The club made its debut in the FA trophy competition in the 1975‚Äì76 season and three season later in 1978 also made their debut in the FA Vase. After several seasons in the Western league with little success, except for the notable win against Yeovil Town over two legs in the Somerset Professional Cup, mounting financial concerns forced the club to fold once again. In 1980 the club reformed again in the Yeovil and District League. One season later the club was elected into the Dorset Premier League. In 1987 they made the Somerset Senior cup final, for the first time under the guidance of manager Stuart Housley. Phil Chant took over the management of the club at the start of the 1988‚Äì89 season, and four years later saw them win the double, of the Dorset Combination league title and the Dorset Combination cup. This was almost repeated the following season but they finished as runners up in the league whilst lifting the cup again. In 1999 Pete Watts took over as manager, and the club had to move from its home of Westbourne Grove, as it had been sold for redevelopment. For a couple of seasons, the Club played at Bunford Lane before moving to its present home of Alvington Lane for the 2003‚Äì04 campaign. A season after moving to their new home the club won the Somerset Senior Cup for the first time in their history following a 2‚Äì1 victory against Hengrove Athletic. At the start of the 2006‚Äì07 season Neil Waddleton and Pete Tutton were appointed as joint managers and they saw the team lift the league title at the end of the season. Three Seasons later with Stuart Smith becoming joint manager with Neil Waddleton the club again won the Somerset Senior Cup. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, a new manager, ex Westlands player Kevin Leigh, was appointed with Neil Waddleton staying on as assistant manager. The following season 2011/12 proved to be a memorable one in the history of the club when they won a 'treble' of Dorset Premier League Championship, Dorset Premier League Cup and Somerset Senior Cup.

Arrested by the NKVD, he was sentenced in the Trial of the Sixteen and murdered in a Soviet prison. Jankowski was born in the village of Krasowo Wielkie in ≈Åom≈ºa Governorate (now in Wysokie Mazowieckie County), some 60 kilometres from Warsaw. Born to a family of local szlachta, he received an education in Austro-Hungarian Galicia. Early in his youth he became involved in politics. As a Socialist, in 1906 he was among the co-founders of the National Workers' Union. In 1912 he entered the KTSSN, a Galicia-based confederation of all the political factions supporting Austria-Hungary as the only state to be able to reunite and liberate Poland after roughly a century of partitions. In 1915, at the outbreak of the Great War, he joined the Polish Legions. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, he remained an active politician. In 1920 he co-founded the National Workers' Party (NPR), which he headed until 1923 and of which he remained a deputy chairman until 1933. As the most prominent politician of the NPR, between 1921 and the May coup d'√©tat of 1926 he was the minister of labour and social policies in the government of Poland. In 1928 he was elected a member of the Sejm, a seat he held until 1935. In 1937 he moved to the Labor Party and became one of its leaders. After the Polish Defensive War of 1939 he remained in Poland and helped in the reconstruction of his party in new, underground conditions. After the foundations for the Polish Secret State had been laid, in 1941 Jankowski became the Director of Labour and Social Care (a de facto minister) of the Government Delegate's Office at Home. After Jan Pieka≈Çkiewicz was arrested by the Gestapo in February 1943, Jankowski replaced him as the Government Delegate at Home, under the formal rank of the deputy Prime Minister of Poland. On 31 July 1944 he approved the decision to start the Warsaw Uprising. During the fighting in Warsaw, he remained close to the headquarters of the Armia Krajowa, but lost any contact with most of the cells of the Government Delegate's Office in other parts of Poland. After the capitulation of Warsaw to the Germans, he left the city along with civilians and managed to hide in the countryside, from where he continued his duties. In summer 1944 Jankowski criticized the \\"overtly philosemitic\\" policies of the Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk government. While stating he recognizes some pro-Jewish actions are required to advance Polish foreign relations, Jankowski advised restraining these tendencies writing in a report that the government should \\"bear in mind that inside the country Jews are disliked\\".Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present, Joanna Michlic, University of Nebraska Press, page 154 In March 1945 he was arrested by the NKVD and taken to Moscow, where he was put on trial together with 15 other representatives of the Polish authorities. After three months of brutal interrogation and torture he was presented with the forged accusations of collaboration with Nazi Germany, sabotage, terrorism, planning a military alliance with Nazi Germany, owning a radio transmitter and several other trumped-up charges. He was sentenced to eight years in a Soviet prison and died there, probably murdered there on March 13, 1953, two weeks before the end of his sentence. His body was probably buried in the prison in Vladimir on Klyazma, though the whereabouts of his death, as well as the place of his burial remain classified. In addition to the Virtuti Militari (5th class) he received for his service in the Warsaw Uprising, in 1995 Jankowski was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Eagle.

It was founded on April 9, 1990, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa by five collegiate women who wanted an organization to empower Latina women. The sorority focuses on five principles: academics, community service, cultural awareness, social interaction, and morals and ethics. National programming includes the Young Women's Leadership Program, Emotional Intelligence, and their philanthropic \\"Drive to 25.\\" They have also partnered up with other organizations to raise awareness about different issues, such as the American Heart Association for heart disease, Voto Latino to encourage youth of color to vote, and the American Red Cross for water safety. With over 10,000 members, the sorority has a diverse membership, claiming to represent over 110 nationalities. Having expanded to more than 100 universities in less than 20 years, membership in the organization is open to any woman who meets the membership requirements, regardless of religion, race, or nationality. Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university, or after acquiring a college degree through an alumnae association. History In fall of 1989, a group of women met to form an organization that would provide empowerment to Latina women. By April 9, 1990, the University of Iowa Panhellenic Council officially recognized the organization as a sorority, which Sigma Lambda Gamma celebrates as their founding date. The five women who were instrumental in establishing the organization‚ÄìGloria Cuevas, Julieta Maria Miller, Maria Ester Pineda, Danell Marie Riojas, and Guadalupe Temiquel‚Äìare collectively referred to as the Five Founding Mothers. A national headquarters was initially established at 900 West Penn Street, North Liberty, Iowa. They later moved to their current address at 1295 Jordan St., Suite 3, P.O. Box 395, North Liberty, IA 52317. Along with housing national records and staff, it was once also home to the sorority's national biannual publication, La Mensajera. The Omega Chapter was later established to recognize and pay respect to deceased sisters. As the sorority grew, Sigma Lambda Gamma's membership became more multicultural. In acknowledging this, the organization, which was a part of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO) from January 2001 to May 2010, left due to a desire for autonomy and due to their increasing multicultural membership. The sorority celebrated their 100th and 101st chapters simultaneously with the addition of the Theta Delta chapter at Columbia University and the Iota Delta chapter at Millikin University in 2010, having expanded to more than 100 chapters in 20 years. While chapters have always organized local programming on their respective campuses, Sigma Lambda Gamma later created the Education Foundation, where national programs were birthed. The Young Women‚Äôs Leadership program was designed to promote confidence and leadership skills for middle-school aged girls. An Emotional Intelligence education program was also started up. Scholarships were later added to support members in higher education. In 2012, the Panther Dash For Education was developed to generate funds that will support scholastic achievement and leadership training. A virtual race, sisters are encouraged to participate in any run/walk event of their choice and then later upload it to media sites. For their 2013 National Sisterhood Retreat, Sigma Lambda Gamma was honored by the Diosa Nail & Polish company with their colors to commemorate the Educate. Engage. Empower. theme. Sisters suggested names and voted on it. The two colors are: ‚ÄúWomen of Dis-PINK-tion‚Äù to reflect their color shocking pink and ‚ÄúOn the Prowl‚Äù to reflect their color majestic purple as well as their stone, amethyst. It was made available exclusively to sisters only and has since been sold out. To commemorate their 25th anniversary, the sorority launched their philanthropic campaign, ‚ÄúDrive to 25,‚Äù focusing on empowering women and spreading cultural awareness. Sisters across the nation took part in hosting and participating in community-based events, whether it is coordinating a book drive or volunteering in a local women's shelter. Founders snapshot of the five Founding Mothers of the sorority The Five Founding Mothers of Sigma Lambda Gamma are: *Gloria Cuevas *Julieta Maria Miller *Maria Ester Pineda *Danell Marie Riojas *Guadalupe Cruz Temiquel Philanthropic and social awareness = Philanthropy = Sigma Lambda Gamma's first philanthropy is to raise awareness about breast cancer. Although Sigma Lambda Gamma's website once stated support for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, they currently do not affiliate with either one. In 2013, one member shaved her head to raise money for cancer research, eventually topping $2650, while the Theta Gamma Chapter organized a fashion show and raised over $800 in 2014. The following year, the Xi Beta Chapter organized a ball with the men of Phi Beta Sigma to raise funds for breast cancer and the March of Dimes. In 2014, the sorority raised over $14,000 collectively to donate to 20 different breast cancer research organizations. The sorority also support the Federal TRiO Programs, which are programs in the United States designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similar to breast cancer awareness, chapters have organized local fundraisers to donate to the programs: the Beta Epsilon Chapter hosted a bake sale in 2017 while the Tau Delta Chapter organized a volleyball tournament in 2018. = Social issues awareness = The sorority have also partnered with different organizations to raise awareness about different societal issues. In hopes of encouraging their members and youth of color to promote positive change in their community, they began a partnership with Voto Latino in 2012, a nonpartisan organization that empowers Latino Millennials to claim a better future for themselves and their community by voting and learning how to make a difference. In the 2014 Voto Latino's RepUrLetters Challenge, in which historically Latino Greek-lettered organizations competed to register voters on their campuses and in their communities, Sigma Lambda Gamma's voter registration efforts accounted for 36% of the total number of voters registered, with the highest number of voters registered. In 2014, the sorority launched their \\"Gammas Go Red\\" campaign in partnership with the American Heart Association on social media in an effort to raise awareness about heart disease in women. Additionally, they launched a partnership with the American Red Cross after attending the 2017 Diversity in Aquatics Symposium, focusing on educating about the importance of water safety. In 2020, they publicly voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement after Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, an unarmed 25-year-old African-American man, was pursued and fatally shot while jogging near Brunswick in Glynn County, Georgia. Additionally, chapters also organize local philanthropic projects and have hosted events about other social issues. The Chi Gamma Chapter raised funds for the 2013 Oklahoma tornado disaster the same year it occurred, the Beta Gamma Chapter adopted a highway in 2015, the Gamma Chapter held a fundraiser for animal shelters in 2015, the Kappa Gamma Chapter hosted a panel about LGBTQ identities in 2017, and the Epsilon Zeta Chapter raised awareness about male sexual assault with the men of Alpha Phi Alpha in 2019. National programs These programs are under the Sigma Lambda Gamma Education Foundation, an umbrella philanthropic entity. =Young Women‚Äôs Leadership Program= An eight-week program, the Young Women's Leadership Program is a series of exercises and activities for school-age girls. Members serve as facilitators of these activities, in addition to mentors. The Sigma Lambda Gamma Education Foundation assist programs across the country to provide materials, transportation, food and other program costs for facilitators and participants. =Panther Dash for Education= To encourage members to mobilize their body as well as give back to the community, Sigma Lambda Gamma created the Panther Dash for Education in 2012. Members can participate in any 5K race of their choice and purchase Sigma Lambda Gamma packages, such as bib, T-shirt, or water bottle with the sorority's letters and logo, to raise funds. =Emotional Intelligence= This Emotional Intelligence program focuses on members addressing the needs of the sisterhood in the most timely and effective way. All members complete the EI Profile: An Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment. Based on the results of this self- assessment, members will have the chance during the academic year to learn more about the nineteen different skills of emotional intelligence. =Scholarships= Annual scholarships are given to members who have been initiated into the organization and are in good-standing, as defined by Sigma Lambda Gamma policy, who are enrolled as degree-seeking student during the academic year. Sisters who are studying abroad are not eligible. The two offered are the Mary L. Peterson Scholarship and the Esther Materon-Arum Scholarship, named after the two women who helped the Founding Mothers in creating the sorority. Membership A criterion for membership into Sigma Lambda Gamma is that a woman must have exceptional morals and ethics with a demonstrated commitment to academic excellence, and is pursuing or has completed courses leading to a degree in an accredited college or university. Memberships are categorized as undergrad or alumnae. According to Sigma Lambda Gamma's national constitution, they believe that a multicultural experience during the college years enhances each member's ability to function in a pluralistic society. They do not discriminate on the basis of age, race, national origin, religious preference, sexual orientation or disability. They encourage their members to celebrate the diverse backgrounds of all the members of the sorority, and currently claim to have over 110 nationalities. =Stance on hazing= Sigma Lambda Gamma does not condone hazing, and defines it as ‚Äúany act or tradition that endangers the physical, mental or emotional well-being of an associate and/or initiated member.‚Äù Believing that it is their ‚Äúresponsibility to treat all women with the respect and dignity they deserve,‚Äù the sorority strive to ‚Äúmaintain a healthy culture that uplifts and supports one another and our community.‚Äù Despite this, several chapters have been shut down for breaching Sigma Lambda Gamma's anti-hazing policy. The University of Florida chapter, Rho Alpha, was suspended in 2009 after it was found out that they required their members to run and do push-ups, and they also had rules and restrictions regarding eating, make-up, and how to get to classes. The University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln's chapter of Sigma Lambda Gamma, Nu Beta, was placed under one academic year suspension in 2012 for violating the national chapter's \\"human dignity policy\\" and \\"national hazing policy.‚Äù =Notable members= *Tamika Henry, Alpha Gamma Chapter: Miss Guyana Universe 2010 *Jilisa Milton, Tau Gamma Chapter: Miss Alabama U.S. International 2013 *Vannessa Vasquez, Chi Alpha Chapter: Actress *Claudia Sandoval, Pi Chapter, and SLG Education Foundation Trustee: Cockrell Hill City Councilwoman, Place 2 *Monica Lira Bravo, Pi Chapter: Dallas County Community College District Trustee, District 4 *Cindy Polo, Iota Alpha Chapter: Florida State House Representative *Destiny Navaira, Xi Chapter: Tejano Singer, Vocalist for Grupo Remedio See also *List of Sigma Lambda Gamma chapters *List of social fraternities and sororities References External links * Official website * Sigma Lambda Gamma Education Foundation Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Hispanic and Latino organizations Category:Fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:Latino fraternities and sororities Category:Women's rights organizations Category:Student organizations established in 1990 Category:1990 establishments in Iowa ","title":"Sigma Lambda Gamma"},{"id":"3904981","text":"Robert Wilbur Morgan (July 23, 1937 - May 22, 1998) was an American radio personality best known for his work at several stations in Los Angeles, California, in particular KHJ-AM. Morgan also did morning drive at KMPC-AM, KIQQ-FM and KMGG-FM, and finished his career at KRTH-FM, where he retired for health reasons in 1997. He died from lung cancer on May 22, 1998. Biography =Early years= As a youth growing up in Galion, Ohio, Morgan's interest was piqued while listening to his favorite DJs on Cleveland's top forty giant KYW (then on 1100 AM before they moved to Philadelphia) which would eventually lead to his first on-air job at Wooster College in 1955 on WWST & WWST-FM, for an initial salary of $1 per hour. In 1959 Morgan moved from college radio to KACY Port Hueneme (Ventura), California where he hosted the overnight show called Kegler's Spare Time with Bob Morgan live from the Wagon Wheel Bowl before moving on to a succession of brief stints beginning in 1961 at KTEE Carmel as the second half of a two-man classical music program with Bob Elliott, a Marine Corps Heavyweight Champion who later went on to radio fame as \\"K.O. Bailey,\\" then a short time later as the morning drive DJ and mid-day board-op for the Arthur Godfrey Show at KMBY, Monterey, then a jump to KOMY Watsonville, then back to KMBY Monterey followed in 1962 with a stint at \\"K-MAKE\\", KMAK, Fresno where he first worked with program director Ron Jacobs. This was followed in 1963 by an eight-month stay at KROY Sacramento before finally landing his first major-market job in 1964 at KEWB, Oakland-San Francisco. It was here that he met and worked with his lifelong friend \\"The Real\\" Don Steele. On April 27, 1965 the careers of Morgan, Steele and programmer Ron Jacobs would gain superstar status almost overnight when they joined the staff of KHJ-AM, Los Angeles. Programming genius Bill Drake along with a staff of talented DJs called \\"Boss Jocks\\" had transformed a sleepy giant into the city's most dominant radio station. It was here that Morgan enjoyed his greatest on-air success as one of the original \\"Boss Jocks\\" on 93/KHJ which dominated the Top 40 radio market in Southern California from 1965 to 1973. Morgan's signature slogans, \\"Good Morgan Boss Angeles!\\" and \\"Arise and Morganize\\" would become familiar to his devoted morning drive time audience until the end of his career. It was also Morgan that voiced many of the \\"Boss Radio/93 KHJ station promos and imagery. It was also during this time that Morgan co-produced and narrated the 48-hour History of Rock and Roll in 1969, a definitive on-air encyclopedia of Rock & Roll. It was the first-ever \\"rock-umentary\\" aired worldwide as a definitive history of the Rock & Roll genre‚Äîa \\"rockumentary,\\" as producers Drake and Gene Chenault would call it‚Äîthat would stretch from the early 1950s to 1989. In 1969-70, Morgan hosted the final year of The Groovy Show on KHJ‚Äôs sister television station KHJ, Channel 9, in Los Angeles. In 1970 Morgan made a surprise move from Los Angeles to WIND Radio Chicago where he remained in the morning slot until finally being enticed back to his KHJ morning show in 1972. Until his departure from KHJ in October 1970, Morgan had commanded unparalleled radio ratings in Los Angeles. Morgan's return to his former time slot in L.A., saw a significant spike upward for KHJ until he departed just a year later. Post KHJ In 1973, Morgan and Steele walked out of KHJ and joined Bill Drake six months later at KIQQ-FM, Los Angeles. The ratings were sub-par, though, causing Morgan to leave the morning slot a year and a half later for weekends and fill-in slots at the prestigious KMPC Los Angeles. He did that for four years before legendary morning man Dick Whittinghill retired in 1980, allowing Morgan to go back to mornings. He stayed at KMPC until 1984. After a short stint at KMGG, Morgan returned to KMPC. Morgan also appeared on television as host of several variety shows, including Morgan‚Äôs Alley, ABC‚Äôs In Concert, NBC‚Äôs The Helen Reddy Show, and KHJ-TV‚Äôs Groovy Show, which he co-hosted with teen model Kam Nelson. Morgan was also the announcer for Solid Gold throughout most of the 1980s. Morgan was heard in 1973 on Saturday night segments of the long-running NBC Radio program Monitor, an attempt to freshen that program's image. During the mid to late 70s, Morgan also did his own one-hour radio weekly special highlighting one artist or group per show. \\"Robert W. Morgan's Special of the Week\\" was often played on radio stations that also carried Casey Kasem's American Top 40 as the same company, Watermark, distributed both. In fact, on the weekends of February 8, 1975 and September 29, 1979, he hosted both shows on the same weekend as he subbed for Casey on AT40 in addition to hosting his own SOTW. Morgan is one of only two substitute hosts to have filled in on both a three-hour and a four-hour AT40 (Morgan's fellow ex-KHJ jock Mark Elliot is the other.); in fact he recorded his 1979 AT40 episode in over 40 minutes, faster than any episode hosted by a regular or substitute host. End of a legendary career The year 1992 would signal the twilight years of Morgan's distinguished radio broadcast career when he signed on as morning show host of \\"oldies\\" K-EARTH 101, where he again enjoyed solid ratings in the Los Angeles market before announcing in May 1997 that he was suffering from lung cancer. According to L.A. radio personality Bob Shannon, Morgan told his listeners, \\"It could have something to do with the two-packs- a-day cigarette habit I had for the last 35 years.\\" In an emotional on-air statement, Morgan stated that he was taking some time off to fight the disease full-time.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Other-Documments/LA- Radio-Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1997-07.pdf His friend and colleague Don Steele died of lung cancer in August 1997.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Other-Documments/LA-Radio- Guide/LA-Radio-Guide-1997-10-11.pdf Morgan continued to do broadcasts from his home studio until 1998. On January 9, 1998, K-EARTH 101 held a retirement tribute for Morgan at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills. The tribute included a re-dedication of his Star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame, and a three-hour broadcast from the museum‚Äôs theater, hosted by Gary Owens and Morgan's KRTH co-host, Joni Caryl.Zap! Morgan immortalized at the Museum of Television and Radio It concluded with a thirty-minute retrospective on Morgan‚Äôs career, narrated by Dick Clark. Morgan died on May 22, 1998. He was 60 years old. Morgan was married twice and was survived by a daughter. Awards In addition to receiving Billboard magazine's Air Personality of the Year award in 1967, Morgan was awarded the Gavin Professional Programmer's Man of the Year Award, a citation from the National Association of Broadcasters for \\"Significant Achievement in American Broadcasting,\\" and unanimous election to the Ohio Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. Samples of his work are on permanent display at the Museum of Broadcasting in New York City, the Museum of Television & Radio in Beverly Hills and the International Broadcasting Congress archives in Brussels. He also has a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, just outside the Dolby Theatre complex on the corner of Hollywood and Highland. References External links *Robert W. Morgan Boss-Ography * *Robert W.

It was intended to appear at the Aviator stand at the Motor Show of 1910-1911, and especially to take part in the Circuit of Belgium in 1911. Construction began at the time of Baron de Caters' trip to India. The Bollekens Brothers, advised by the count d' Hespel and Lieutenant Sarteel, succeeded in presenting the aircraft at the Motor Show, where it was noticed by experts. In spring of 1911 the aeroplane again became the property of the Bollekens brothers. The Bollekens brothers painted the text 'J√©ro-Anvers' on all the rudders at this time. The J√©ro N¬∞ 9 was equipped with a cockpit protected by a hood which carried the armorial of the town of Antwerp. The pilot Parisot, flying the J√©ro N¬∞9 (with fuselage but with no hooding), finished in second place at the Circuit of Belgium, and won several awards. Back to Sint-Job-in't-Goor, the J√©ro N¬∞ 9 was the preferred aircraft of student pilots, with Henri Molla as instructor. Modified with a triangular tail in 1913 and equipped with a Gn√¥me 80 CV engine, the Jero N¬∞9 was used for training at Saint-Job and Kiewit.

It became a beacon for the park during this time. The ride was dismantled and removed from the park in 2005. History The Great Gasp in operation When it opened in 1976, the ride was a masterpiece of engineering. The Great Gasp was derived from the Parachute Jump ride at the Coney Island in New York. Ride engineers from Intamin (also referred to as Ride Trade) developed the ride at their headquarters in Switzerland, and when the management from Six Flags Over Georgia visited, they knew the ride would be a great addition to their park. The ride was constructed for $1.5 million, a huge investment at the time. Similar Parachute Drop rides were also built at Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Over Mid-America. The Great Gasp opened with 12 chutes; later the ride was modified to include four stations in which the passengers rode in the standing position. Over the years, the stand-up chutes were removed, and as popularity dwindled, the number of chutes in use also fell. As the popularity of the ride fell and spare parts became increasingly difficult to obtain, the era of the Great Gasp was doomed to end. On August 14, 2005, Six Flags Over Georgia announced that the Great Gasp would cease operation forever. On the final weekend, riders were given \\"Last Gasp\\" pins in commemoration of the legendary ride's last days. Within three weeks of \\"Last Gasp\\", the Great Gasp was dismantled and removed from the park. Operational features A \\"Last Gasp\\" pin Pieces of the Great Gasp when the tower was in the midst of disassembly Gasp opened with 12 chutes, although as the ride control system was upgraded and popularity decreased, that number was reduced to 8 chutes. Each seat held two riders, and was equipped with a seat belt and restraint bar. Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute. The control system could detect empty seats as well as overloaded seats and would prevent cycling them. The control system hardware was located in the small ring housing at the base of the tower. An anemometer was mounted at the top of the ride, and was tied into the control system as to prevent operation when wind gusted above a preset limit. A small elevator inside the tower allowed access to the winch and motor housing at the top. The tower also held antennas for in-park radio communications. The Gasp served as a focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations in 1990. A huge \\"1991\\" sign was mounted, and fireworks were actually launched from the top ring of the Gasp while a \\"Peach\\" was dropped, much like the one still dropped in Atlanta, during the Holiday in the Park New Year's Eve celebration on December 31, 1990. It has been said that pieces of the Great Gasp were sent to Six Flags Over Texas for spare parts on the Texas Chute Out ensuring it could stay in operation for the next few years. The Texas Chute Out closed on September 3, 2012, and was demolished by Dallas Demolition on October 10, 2012. It was replaced with the Texas Sky Screamer which is nearly twice as tall as the Texas Chute Out.

It is situated in a village of Kampung Makam near Kota Tinggi town. Its main feature is the Tomb of Sultan Mahmud Shah II, who was the last ruler of Johor descended from the Sultans of Malacca. History The tomb's legend is found in the book Tuhfat al-Nafis. In 1699, during the reign of Mahmud Shah II, pirates were storming the shores of southern Johor, from Mersing to Pulau Penyengat and Riau. Laksamana (Admiral) Megat Seri Rama, known as Laksamana Bentan, ‚Äî named after his island of origin Bintan ‚Äî was ordered to stop the menace. He left behind his beloved wife, Dang Anum, who was pregnant, while he went to stop the pirate attacks. His absence presented an opportunity to a former palace officer, who was jealous of Megat Seri Rama, to plot against him. Dang Anum craved a piece of jackfruit, taken from the palace orchard, that was on its way to be presented to the Sultan. The penghulu or the head of a sub-district, who was sending the fruit to the palace sympathised with Dang Anum. He stole a piece of jackfruit and gave it to Dang Anum. The Sultan, who noticed that the fruit had been cut, before he tasted the fruit, was so angered with the penghulu's action. His thoughts were also poisoned by the jealous palace officer who said that Dang Anum's action had obviously brought shame to the Sultan, leaving the Sultan to eat the rest of the fruit after her. The sultan ordered the women to the palace for punishment. Desperate for her life and the child she bore in her belly, Dang Anum told the sultan that the fruit that she ate was for her child. The Sultan asked for proof and the woman's belly was cut, and the child was seen with the piece of the jackfruit. The murder was kept secret to all the palace inhabitants. As Megat Seri Rama discovered the murder of his wife and unborn child after returning from the war, he decided to seek revenge. On one Friday afternoon, during the Friday prayers, while the Sultan was being carried up (dijulang) by his men, he was ambushed and stabbed to death by Rama. As the sultan heaved his last breath, he cast a curse which forbade all sons of Bintan to touch the grounds of Kota Tinggi for eternity or they shall vomit blood to death. Rama died as well as the sultan. The sultan, known later as the \\"one died in his palanquin\\" (Sultan Mahmud Mangkat Dijulang) was buried in Kampung Makam, Kota Tinggi, while Laksamana Megat Seri Rama at Kampung Kelantan, also in Kota Tinggi. To this day, there are people still believe that the curse exists and most Bintanese feared to come to Kota Tinggi. Other versions of this story state that the curse lasts seven generations.

It is his largest body of work after his time as regular penciler on Top Cow's The Darkness. Wraithborn was published by WildStorm under its Wildstorm Signature imprint, which replaced the Cliffhanger imprint. Story The Wraithborn power is normally given to a specially chosen warrior, someone who has trained for decades to wield the power and fight the Immortals. But, due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\", the power is passed on to an ordinary high school girl who doesn't know anything about what's going on, but she's got to figure things out fast because a lot of \\"people\\" (including the Immortals) are coming after her. At the heart of things, Wraithborn is about the transformation of a sweet, timid, innocent girl into a tough, badass, seemingly cold and heartless warrior who has to do a lot of things that she may not like to do. And we follow her on this journey, through the many trials she has to face, the mistakes she'll make, and the grievous consequences of those mistakes. In addition, it‚Äôs also about the journey made by Valin, the male lead of the story, who is the young man who was supposed to be given the Wraithborn power. But the mini-series, which is an origin story, focuses more on Melanie. We‚Äôll get more into Valin‚Äôs story in future story arcs. Concept The book is a supernatural, dark fantasy story inspired by folklore and mythologies from around the world. The idea being that all these legends were based on some truth, that gods and demons and angels and so forth really do exist, and once walked this earth. But one day, they all seemed to vanish, and eventually we just wrote them off as fiction. But they're still around, and they're trying really hard to get back and reclaim their former \\"lordship and dominion\\" over all humankind. The Wraithborn are special individuals who have the only power that can fight these \\"Immortals\\", and throughout the ages, they've been protecting us and preventing the Immortals from returning. Issues Issue #1: The story starts out with the tough and fearless Wraithborn. Seemingly, the Immortals are powerless unless someone \\"invites them in,\\" and when that happens, she has to deal with the consequences (the Immortals take possession of the mortal's body). Wraithborn seems to have a terrible past; the story alludes the total loss of her family and friends as a result of some foolish mistake. Then the story switches to Melanie Moore‚Äîan ordinary teenage girl cooking breakfast for her dad (to lower his cholesterol) so he won't go out and buy crap on the way to work. It's apparent that Melanie's starved for fatherly attention and affection. At school she's not that great at sports and the other girls are hard on her. But she has a conscious for helping out other people. She sweet and caring, nerdy and likable. As the story progresses, it starts to become clear why she is the way she is. . . then the plot begins to unravel as to why Melanie became Wraithborn. Issue #2: The hunt begins! Rival parties, both mortal and Immortal, race to find and capture the new Wraithborn. Meanwhile, Melanie continues her everyday routine, oblivious to both her new powers and \\"popularity\\". Who, or what, will find her first? Issue #3: The hounds of Brijit have found Melanie but she doesn't know that she has powers, much less how to use them! How will she escape? Plus a mysterious stranger shows up, but is he a friend... or a foe? Issue #4: The calm before the storm. Melanie begins to realize she's involved in something she doesn't understand‚Äîsomething dangerous‚Äîand she needs help. Is there anyone she can turn to? Meanwhile, Brijit and Kiara each plot their next moves in the race to obtain the power of the Wraithborn. Issue #5: Secrets are revealed as Melanie continues her quest to understand the Wraithborn and what role she plays with them! Despite all the hidden agendas and challenges she must face, one thing appears certain: She will be in constant danger as long as she wields the Wraithborn power! Issue #6: Melanie is captured by Brijit and is having the Wraithborn power taken from her, she must fight or she must die in this thriller end of the mini-series!

Biography Portrait of Bendemann by Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein, chalk on paper, 1838 Bendemann was born in Berlin. His father, Anton Heinrich Bendemann, was a Jewish banker. His mother, Fanny Eleonore Bendemann n√©e von Halle, was a daughter of the Jewish banker Joel Samuel von Halle. His father monitored his education closely and it would have naturally led him to some sort of technical occupation, but his talent and propensity towards art resulted in his being allowed to pursue other interests. After he completed elementary school, he enrolled in the Wilhelm von Schadow's school in D√ºsseldorf. In 1828 he painted a portrait of his grandmother which attracted some attention. In 1830 he went on a school trip to Italy where he remained for a year. After a series of jobs, among them with Boas and Ruth, his talent as an artist began to show, especially with his very large 1832 painting titled, The Jews Mourning in Exile which was featured in the Berlin art exhibition. The picture garnered a great deal of attention, which was in part due to the deep and simple feeling and the noble composition of the piece, and finally went to the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne. Bendemann's second picture, The Two Girls at the Well (1832), was acquired by the North Rhine-Westphalia Art Association. Soon thereafter followed Jeremiah amid the Ruins of Jerusalem for which the artist received a medal in Paris in 1837. This painting was for the most part about the progress of the Jews in Babylon. (Royal Palace in Hanover). His best known work is The Harvest. The artist‚Äôs first fresco was a symbolic representation of the art at the ‚ÄúPoetry Well‚Äù at the house of his parents-in-law in Berlin. In the year 1838, Bendemann was appointed professor of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. He soon had the opportunity to paint even larger frescos. He was commissioned to decorate three halls of the Dresden royal palace with wall paintings: the throne room, the tower room, and the tower hall. In the throne room, on both sides of the throne, there are representations of important rulers and legislators in gold leaf with smaller representations in relief form below, from Moses up to Albert III, Duke of Saxony. On the wall facing the throne there are four paintings depicting events from the life of King Heinrich I each with other pictures attached which explain each of the four events. This exacting work occupied the greater part of his time for fifteen years. From 1859 to 1867, he was director of the D√ºsseldorf Academy. Bendemann died in D√ºsseldorf.

History and properties The gyroid is the unique non-trivial embedded member of the associate family of the Schwarz P and D surfaces with angle of association approximately 38.01¬∞. The gyroid is similar to the Lidinoid. The gyroid was discovered in 1970 by NASA scientist Alan Schoen. He calculated the angle of association and gave a convincing demonstration pictures of intricate plastic models, but did not provide a proof of embeddedness. Schoen noted that the gyroid contains neither straight lines nor planar symmetries. Karcher gave a different, more contemporary treatment of the surface in 1989 using conjugate surface construction. In 1996 Gro√üe-Brauckmann and Wohlgemuth proved that it is embedded, and in 1997 Gro√üe-Brauckmann provided CMC variants of the gyroid and made further numerical investigations about the volume fractions of the minimal and CMC (constant mean curvature) gyroids. The gyroid separates space into two oppositely congruent labyrinths of passages. The gyroid has space group I4132 (no. 214) . Channels run through the gyroid labyrinths in the (100) and (111) directions; passages emerge at 70.5 degree angles to any given channel as it is traversed, the direction at which they do so gyrating down the channel, giving rise to the name \\"gyroid\\". One way to visualize the surface is to picture the ‚Äúsquare catenoids‚Äù of the P surface (formed by two squares in parallel planes, with a nearly circular waist); rotation about the edges of the square generate the P surface. In the associate family, these square catenoids ‚Äúopen up‚Äù (similar to the way the catenoid ‚Äúopens up‚Äù to a helicoid) to form gyrating ribbons, then finally become the Schwarz D surface. For one value of the associate family parameter the gyrating ribbons lie in precisely the locations required to have an embedded surface. The gyroid is the only known embedded triply periodic minimal surface that possesses triple junctions and no lines of reflectional symmetry, unlike the five minimal surfaces studied in Anderson et al. (1990). The gyroid refers to the member that is in the associate family of the Schwarz P surface, but in fact the gyroid exists in several families that preserve various symmetries of the surface; a more complete discussion of families of these minimal surfaces appears in triply periodic minimal surfaces. Curiously, like some other triply periodic minimal surfaces, the gyroid surface can be trigonometrically approximated by a short equation: :\\\\sin x\\\\cos y+\\\\sin y\\\\cos z+\\\\sin z\\\\cos x=0 The gyroid structure is closely related to the K4 crystal (Laves' graph of girth ten). Applications In nature, self-assembled gyroid structures are found in certain surfactant or lipid mesophases and block copolymers. In the polymer phase diagram, the gyroid phase is between the lamellar and cylindrical phases. Such self-assembled polymer structures have found applications in experimental supercapacitors, solar cells and nanoporous membranes. Gyroid membrane structures are occasionally found inside cells.S. Hyde, Z. Blum, T. Landh, S. Lidin, B.W. Ninham, S. Andersson, K. Larsson, The Language of Shape: The Role of Curvature in Condensed Matter: Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Elsevier, 1996 Gyroid structures have photonic band gaps that make them potential photonic crystals. Gyroid structures have been observed in biological structural coloration such as butterfly wing scales, inspiring work on biomimetic materials. The gyroid mitochondrial membranes in tree shrew cones might have an optical function. In 2017, MIT researchers studied the possibility of using the gyroid shape to turn bi-dimensional materials, such as graphene, into a three-dimensional structural material with low density yet high tensile strength. Researchers from Cambridge University have shown the controlled chemical vapor deposition of sub-60 nm graphene gyroids. These interwoven structures are one of the smallest free standing graphene 3D structures. They are conductive, mechanically stable and easily transferable, and of interest for a wide range of applications. The gyroid pattern has also found use in 3D printing due to its high strength for lightweight internal structures and ease to print on a FDM 3d printer.

Techniques have been developed for buddy breathing from both twin- hose and single hose regulators, but to a large extent it has been superseded by safer and more reliable techniques using additional equipment, such as the use of a bailout cylinder or breathing through a secondary demand valve on the rescuer's regulator. Running out of breathing gas most commonly happens as a result of poor gas management. It can also happen due to unforeseen exertion or breathing equipment failure. Equipment failure resulting in the loss of all gas could be caused by failure of a pressure retaining component such as an O-ring or hose in the regulator or, in cold conditions, a freezing of water in the regulator resulting in a free flow from the demand valve. Technique I'm out of air: \\"Cutting\\" or \\"chopping\\" throat with a flat hand. Give me air now (emergency implied): pointing to the mouth with thumb and fingers together, moving hand back and forth a short distance. Buddy breathing is usually initialised by the diver with the \\"out of air\\" emergency signalling this to another diver by a standard hand signal \\"give me air\\". This signal is made by holding the fingers and thumb of one hand together, pointing them at the mouth and making repeated movements of the finger tips towards the mouth. The donor is expected to take a good breath and pass his/her demand valve (or mouthpiece in the case of a twin-hose regulator) to the recipient, who is expected to take two good breaths and pass it back. In reality the recipient will often take more than two breaths, and the donor should expect this and relax to minimize metabolic rate. The donor should retain a good grip on the demand valve throughout the buddy breathing process, as a panicked recipient may fail to give it back. A reasonably reliable way of keeping control of the demand valve is to grasp the hose firmly in the fist where it connects to the demand valve. This provides good control but allows the recipient to use the purge button if needed. A pattern of two breaths per diver should be established as soon as possible and then terminate the dive and start the ascent as soon as possible, as air consumption while buddy breathing is usually more than double the normal rate. Most demand valves will only drain correctly if the hose is to the user's right, and in these cases the divers should align themselves to allow convenient movement of the demand valve from donor to recipient and back. When the divers need to ascend or swim horizontally, it requires co-ordination and some skill, which is best practiced in a low hazard environment. =Training= A study by the UCLA Diving Safety Research Project suggests that about 20 successful repetitions of buddy breathing during training of entry level students are needed for a reasonable expectation of success without errors, and retesting after three months without reinforcing practice showed degraded performance and procedural errors. This is a higher level of training than provided by most recreational diver training organisations. For the skill to be reliable in an emergency, periodic reinforcement is necessary, and familiarisation is particularly valuable when buddies are to dive together for the first time. Hazards Buddy breathing is one of the few scuba skills in which the incompetence of one diver can threaten the life of another. Poor buddy breathing performance has resulted in the death of both divers on more than one occasion. History Buddy breathing originated from military diving following a prohibition on the training and practice of free ascents. The procedure has been used since the beginnings of recreational diving, and along with the free ascent was one of the ways a diver could respond to running out of air at depth. At this time twin-hose regulators were the norm. and it was reasonably easy for two divers in a face-to-face position to share the regulator mouthpiece. Buddy breathing was an important skill before reserve valves and submersible pressure gauges were generally available, and running out of air was so common that it was not considered an emergency. By the mid-1960s the availability of submersible pressure gauges made reliable air supply monitoring possible and running out of air became less common. In the late 1960s single-hose regulators started to take over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single hose exhaust valve position at the bottom of most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over- pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use of one hand. the other is needed to control the regulator and hold on to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure. In the 1990s there was also growing concern about the transmission of disease by sharing a mouthpiece, particularly as a better option was available at a reasonable cost. Dive Training magazine ran an article by Alex Brylske in November 1993 detailing the hazards of buddy breathing and the advantages of alternative systems, and over the following years the practice was phased out of most recreational diver training programmes in favour of the use of secondary second stages and where applicable, a controlled emergency swimming ascent.  Alternatives  Most recreational and professional diver training organisations would consider relying on buddy breathing from a single regulator as an unacceptable risk, as the use of a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, is a far more reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should never be a situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers need to share a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances. Buddy breathing is discouraged by many training agencies because other more reliable techniques and equipment exist. The technique needs training and regular practice by both divers if it is to be used successfully in a crisis; panic and task loading being the main reasons for it failing. Especially in situations in which one or both of the participants are not well-trained in the technique, the procedure has been criticised for endangering two people instead of one. Many divers fit a second demand valve, often called an \\"octopus\\", to their diving regulators, for emergency use by another diver. Some go so far as to recognise that the out-of-air diver will want the demand valve they are breathing off at the time, as it is indisputably providing breathing gas, and almost certainly a gas suitable for the current depth. These practice \\"\\" in recognition of this tendency, and often use an extra-long hose (up to 7 ft long) to facilitate the procedure in tight spaces. These divers often wear the secondary demand valve on a \\"\\" which keeps it ready for immediate use under the diver's chin, where it can be retrieved for use without the use of the hands. Divers doing deep diving, cave or wreck penetration, or decompression stops may routinely carry a complete, independent bailout scuba set for their own or their buddy's emergency use. This is particularly prevalent in professional diving operations where it is often mandatory. Use of other emergency air sources such as octopus second stage, integrated DV/BC inflator units, bailout cylinders etc. also requires the learning of appropriate skills. These procedures are as complex as buddy breathing up to the point of sharing, and the fundamental difference is that the donor and recipient are not required to alternate breathing with a period when no air is available, which can be a big advantage. These alternatives to buddy breathing also require substantial learning and reinforcement to be reliable in a stressful situation.  Avoidance  In most cases the need for buddy-breathing or other gas related emergency is avoidable. The equipment is highly reliable when in good condition, and though occasionally breakdowns will occur without warning, in most cases user inspection and testing before the dive, combined with a reasonable planned maintenance schedule carried out by a competent person will pick up potential problems before they escalate to an emergency. Realistic gas planning and monitoring of the remaining gas supply in context of the time required to surface safely will prevent almost all out-of gas emergencies. Carrying a fully redundant emergency gas supply allows the diver to bail out independently of outside assistance if in spite of all precautions, an emergency does occur.

She was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India and of the Planning Commission of India. A public activist for women's emancipation, she founded the Andhra Mahila Sabha (Andhra Women's Conference) in 1937. She was also the founder chairperson of the Central Social Welfare Board. In 1953, she married C.D. Deshmukh, the first Indian governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Finance Minister in India's Central Cabinet during 1950-1956.  Career  Bust of Durgabai Deshmukh in Rajahmundry From her early years, Durgabai had been associated with Indian politics. At age 12, she left school in protest to the imposition of English-medium education. She later started the Balika Hindi Paathshala in Rajamundry to promote Hindi education for girls. When the Indian National Congress had its conference in her hometown of Kakinada in 1923, she was a volunteer and placed in charge of the Khadi exhibition that was running side by side. Her responsibility was to ensure that visitors without tickets didn't enter. She fulfilled the responsibility given to her honestly and even forbade Jawaharlal Nehru from entering.Dedicated to cause of women, The Hindu. 4 November 2002 When the organisers of the exhibition saw what she did and angrily chided her, she replied that she was only following instructions. She allowed Nehru in only after the organisers bought a ticket for him. Nehru praised the girl for the courage with which she did her duty. She was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi in India's struggle for freedom from the British Raj. She never wore jewellery or cosmetics, and she was a satyagrahi. She was a prominent social reformer who participated in Gandhi-led Salt Satyagraha activities during the Civil Disobedience Movement. She was instrumental in organising women satyagrahis in the movement. This led to British Raj authorities imprisoning her three times between 1930 and 1933. After her release from prison, Durgabai continued her studies. She finished her B.A and her M.A in political science in the 1930s from Andhra University. She went on to obtain her Law degree from Madras University in 1942, and started practicing as an advocate in Madras High Court. Durgabai was the president of the Blind Relief Association. In that capacity, she set up a school-hostel and a light engineering workshop for the blind. Durgabai was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India. She was the only women in the panel of Chairmen in the Constituent Assembly. She was instrumental in the enactment of many social welfare laws. She failed to get elected to Parliament in 1952, and was later nominated to be a member of the Planning Commission. In that role, she mustered support for a national policy on social welfare. The policy resulted in the establishment of a Central Social Welfare Board in 1953. As the Board's first chairperson, she mobilized a large number of voluntary organizations to carry out its programs, which were aimed at education, training, and rehabilitation of needy women, children, and the handicapped. She was the first to emphasise the need to set up separate Family Courts after studying the same during her visit to China in 1953. She discussed the idea with Justice M.C. Chagla and Justice P.B. Gajendragadkar of the Bombay High Court (at that time) and also with Jawaharlal Nehru. With similar demands for speedy justice for women in familial matters from women's movement and organisations, the Family Courts Act was enacted in 1984. She was the first chairperson of the National Council on Women's Education, established by the Government of India in 1958. In 1959, the committee presented its recommendations, as follows: # \\"The Centre and State Governments should give priority to the education of girls. # In the central ministry of education, a department of women's education should be created. # For proper education of girls, a Director of Women's Education should be appointed in each state. # Co- education should be properly organised at higher level of education. # The University Grants Commission should specify a definite amount separately for the education of girls. # In the first phase of development, provision of free education should be made for girls up to Class VIII # Facilities in the choice of optional subjects should be made available for girls. # Girls should get training facilities on a liberal basis. # Education of Girls should be given due encouragement in rural areas. # A large number of seats in various services should be reserved for them. # Programmes for the development of adult women's education should be properly initiated and encouraged.\\" To commemorate her legacy, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam has named its Department of Women Studies as Dr. Durgabai Deshmukh Centre for Women's Studies. In 1963, she was sent to Washington D.C. as a member of the Indian delegation to the World Food Congress.  Contribution in Constituent Assembly  She was then elected to the Constituent Assembly from the Madras Province. She was the only woman in the panel of Chairmen in the Constituent Assembly. She proposed Hindustani (Hindi+Urdu) as the national language of India but also expressed fear about the forceful campaign for Hindi in South India. She proposed a period of fifteen years of status quo to enable all the non-Hindi speakers to adopt and learn Hindi.  Personal life  Durgabai Deshmukh was born in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, British India, in the Gummidithala family belonging to Brahmin community; Durgabai was married at the age of 8Woman, Her History and Her Struggle for Emancipation to her cousin, Subba Rao. She refused to live with him after her maturation, and her father and brother supported her decision. She later left him to pursue her education. In 1953, she married the then Finance Minister of India Chintaman Deshmukh. According to her own account, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was one of the three witnesses. C. D. Deshmukh had a daughter from a previous marriage but the couple remained otherwise childless. Though she had parted ways with Subba Rao, she supported his widow Timmaiamma after his death. Timmaiamma lived with Durgabai and Chintaman Deshmukh, and Durgabai also organised for her to get vocational training. Durgabai Deshmukh authored a book called The Stone That Speaketh. Her autobiography Chintaman and I was published one year before her death in 1981. She died in Narasannapeta, in Srikakulam district.

There are currently 13 Cappies programs in the U.S. and Canada, which range in size from five to 55 participating high schools. Within each program, every participating high school selects three to nine students for a critic team. After receiving training in theater criticism and review writing, they attend plays and musicals at other high schools in their area. They write reviews (of roughly 400 words) on deadline. Volunteer teacher-mentors lead discussions and select the critic-written reviews that are later published by area newspapers, with student bylines. The programs operate in and around Baltimore, Maryland; Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; El Paso, Texas; Ft. Lauderdale ‚Äì Palm Beach, Florida; Houston, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Melbourne, Florida; Northern New Jersey; Orange County, California; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, PA; St. Louis, Missouri; Salt Lake City, Utah; Springfield, Missouri; Washington, DC; Edmonton, Alberta; and Ottawa, Ontario.  History  The Cappies began in 1999, in response to the Columbine tragedy, as an effort to bring more positive attention to teenagers engaged in creative pursuits. Capitol Steps founder Bill Strauss approached Fairfax County, Virginia public school administrator Judy Bowns, and together they developed the plan for the program. The program began in Fairfax and immediately became popular among high school drama departments in the area, growing from 14 schools in the fall of 1999 to 23 schools by that spring. The Cappies quickly spread to encompass the entire metro Washington, D.C., area. The Washington Post and several other local papers published student-written reviews, often with photographs (They have since ceased this activity, but instead now post these reviews online in a section entitled \\"Tomorrow's Critics\\".). As a result, the Cappies became a showcase for local theater and journalism talent, with over 50 schools around Washington, the largest Cappies region. Since 2002, it has operated nationwide, with new regional groups appearing yearly.  Organization and process  To start a Cappies program, one must organize a small local meeting with students, parents, and teachers. Four schools must participate for the application to be approved. A steering committee (including a Program director, chair, treasurer, and two other members) is formed, and a charter application must be applied for. While waiting for approval, one should find local newspapers/media outlets that are willing to publish 1-2 reviews on a weekly basis. Once approved, an $300 annual application fee must be paid to Cappies, plus a $5‚Äì10 per-critic fee that is assessed in November based on critic training sessions and enrollments in the online information services. Each regional steering committee determines the per-school fee requirements. Each regional program has a steering committee, with a charter from The Cappies. These are volunteers who oversee the work done by critics and teacher-mentors (who are also volunteers), and who then produce the Cappies Gala. Participating schools select one show (a play or a musical) as their Cappies show. Some smaller Cappies programs allow schools to select two shows. The schools also select teachers to be mentors, who supervise the student critics and help maintain the integrity of the review-writing process. Before the season begins, the mentors and critics receive training from Cappies officials and are often aided by local journalists. On the night of a Cappies show, the critics arrive early, attend the performance, and hold private discussions beforehand, during intermission, and after the show. Afterward, they do a preliminary awards evaluation, selecting who will be on the Cappie awards ballot at the end of the year. After returning home, each critic writes a 200- to 600-word review. The mentors select the reviews they consider the most honest, objective, and best-written, which are then forwarded to local newspapers, many of whom publish these reviews with student bylines. Critics are encouraged to write real reviews, differentiating between shows that are outstanding and those that fall short in various ways. Cappies reviews can and usually do include criticisms, but these should be objective and fair. Also, individuals responsible for a problem should not be named. For example, if a vocalist sings off-key, a critic may state that as an issue in the show, but may not identify the vocalist. With these rules, the Cappies program reflects a consensus among theater teachers that at the high school level, criticisms are appropriate if they are constructive, but not if they are harsh, sarcastic, or personal. After awards voting, each program then holds a Cappies Gala to present Cappie awards and to celebrate the year's shows. Sometimes these galas are held at schools, and other times at major theater venues. The Cappies of the National Capital Area holds its gala in the Concert Hall of the Kennedy Center, the center's largest performance space. These galas are formal and generally include local VIP award presenters, along with performances of songs or scenes from nominated shows. They usually run from two-and-a-half to three hours, and some are televised. = Cappie Awards = # Critic (based on gender or year in school) # Critic Team # Marketing and Publicity # Sound # Make-Up # Props # Special Effects and/or Technology # Lighting # Sets # Costumes # Stage Crew # Stage Management* # Orchestra # Choreography # Creativity # Ensemble in a Play # Ensemble in a Musical # Featured Actor # Featured Actress # Female Dancer # Male Dancer # Female Vocalist # Male Vocalist # Comic Actress in a Play # Comic Actor in a Play # Comic Actress in a Musical # Comic Actor in a Musical # Supporting Actress in a Play # Supporting Actor in a Play # Supporting Actress in a Musical # Supporting Actor in a Musical # Lead Actress in a Play # Lead Actor in a Play # Lead Actress in a Musical # Lead Actor in a Musical # Song # Play # Musical * The Stage Management category is only featured in the Orange County, California chapter of Cappies. = Awards rules = At the end of the school year, within each program, critics who review the required minimum number of shows (usually five) become judges for Cappie nominations and awards. Except for critic awards (determined by a digital formula), all Cappie nominations and awards are decided by student critics. The student critics gather at a central computer site to vote. This process is carefully supervised by adult proctors, and reviewed for accuracy by a trustee and auditor. Depending on the program, there can be anywhere from three to five nominees per award category. The nominees are announced shortly after the voting. The outcome of all awards is determined by unique software developed in 2002 by two high school students from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. Awards are only given to high school students in grades 9-12. The amount of adult involvement in offstage work (building sets, sewing costumes, playing in orchestras, etc.) is strictly established in the rules. A Cappies show that has adults exceeding the allowed level of involvement is not eligible for that category, but is eligible for all other awards. A steering committee of a regional Cappies program can, if it chooses, give a Special Award for Service to a high school student who gave exceptional help, either to the Cappies or to high school theater throughout his or her region.  Cappies International Theater  Every summer, winners of Lead Actor and Actress awards from all programs are invited to attend the Cappies International Theater.Cappies International Theater This CIT company presents three shows, all written entirely by high school students: Starz! (monologues, songs, and minimusicals), Playz! (short plays), and a full-length student- written musical. The latter two are performed at the Kennedy Center Theater Lab. The Cappies International Theater is a summer program focused on the development of dramatic and musical skills. They produce several shows in different categories, and often perform the work of their peers. Students interested in the technical elements of theater also have opportunities to practice and demonstrate their skills. Cappies International Theater began in the summer of 2002 at a small theater in Hollywood. In 2003, in partnership with the Kennedy Center, it moved to Washington, D.C., under the name Cappies National Theater. When the first Canadian program (in Ottawa) joined the Cappies in 2005, the name was changed to Cappies International Theater. Starting in 2006, CIT began featuring works by high school student playwrights, including the two full-length musicals _E_ dit: _U_ ndo and Senioritis. Both were written by nine-person creative teams of student book writers, lyricists, composers, and a digital artist. = Student-written musicals = In 2006, CIT presented the student-written musical _E_ dit: _U_ ndo, which is about teenage life and relationships in the digital era. A CD and DVD of _E_ dit: _U_ ndo are available for sale on the website. In 2007, the CIT company presented the student-written musical Senioritis, which is about the anxieties of senior year. A CD and feature-length film was to be made of Senioritis, following the Kennedy Center performances. In 2008, the Cappies entered into a licensing agreement with the school's musical publisher Next Gen Publications, to represent Edit:Undo, Senioritis, Free-the-Music.com and founder Strauss' Makiddo worldwide. The Cappies International Theater has not taken place since 2009, but may resume in the future.

The county was located partially between Kaiserslautern, Sponheim and Zweibr√ºcken, partially on the Mosel in the Archbishopric of Trier. A municipality of the same name, Veldenz, and a castle, Schloss Veldenz, are located in the district of Bernkastel-Wittlich. History The Counts of Veldenz separated from the Wildgraves of Kyrburg and Schmidburg family in 1112. The direct male line of the first comital house ceased in 1260 with the death of Gerlach V of Veldenz and his daughter Agnes of Veldenz inherited the county in 1260. Her husband Heinrich of Geroldseck became the founder of the second line of Counts of Veldenz or the House of Veldenz-Geroldseck (Hohengeroldseck). In 1444 the county came under the rule of Count palatine Stefan of Pfalz-Simmern- Zweibr√ºcken by his marriage to Anna of Veldenz, the only heiress of Count Frederick III of Veldenz. In 1543, by the Marburg treaty, it was agreed that the uncle of Duke Wolfgang of Zweibr√ºcken, Ruprecht, should receive the county of Veldenz. Ruprecht died in 1544 but his son Hans Georg married Anna Maria of Sweden, a daughter of Gustav I of Sweden in 1563. This was the joining of the House of Wittelsbach with the Swedish Vasa royal family which was strengthened by a further marriage when Johann Casimir of Pfalz-Zweibr√ºcken married Catharina of Sweden, a sister of Gustavus Adolphus in the 17th century. Wolfgang had in 1553 with the Heidelberg Succession agreement regulated the mutual inheritance of all Wittelsbach lines reaching from Veldenz-Palatinate to the county L√ºtzelstein in Alsace. The grandson of Georg Hans, Leopold Ludwig von L√ºtzelstein, died in 1694 without legitimate offspring and the county-Palatinate of Veldenz reverted to the Zweibr√ºcken line. In 1801 it was incorporated into the Saardepartement of the First French Empire. The Congress of Vienna, 1815, gave the smaller part of the county lying on the Mosel to Prussia and the remainder to Bavaria.

One Hermetic maxim states, \\"While All is in The All, it is equally true that The All is in All.\\"(Three Initiates p. 95) The All can also be seen to be androgynous, possessing both masculine and feminine qualities in equal part.(The Way of Hermes p. 19 Book 1:9)  The universe understood in relation to the All  The following is commentary on possibilities about The All but not anything necessarily accepted by Hermeticists in general. According to The Kybalion, The All is a bit more complicated than simply being the sum total of the universe. Rather than The All being simply the physical universe, it is more correct to say that everything in the universe is within the mind of The All, since the ALL can be looked at as Mind itself.(Three Initiates pp. 96-7) In effect, the universe is partially existent on the Mental plane, and we may in fact all be parts of The All's psychological makeup, representing parts of The All in its dream or meditation. The Three Initiates (see The Kybalion) strongly caution that we restrain from simply declaring \\"I am God\\" for oversimplification purposes. Though you are a part of The All, you are but one small piece of that puzzle. You cannot be equated with God any more than your toenail can be equated with you. You have the potential for perfection and to rejoin God, but you are not the totality of God.(Three Initiates pp. 98-9) However stating \\"God is me/I (us)\\" is a more accurate statement. The All's mind can be seen as infinitely more powerful and vast than any of us could hope to achieve.(Three Initiates p. 99) Therefore, it may be capable of keeping track of each and every particle across the expanse of the Universe, as well as maintain symbolism that applies to many lesser entities such as that seen in astrology and numerology. Because of this view, some Hermetics also practice theurgy. If the universe is completely a mental construct, then the mind must be able to mold it and shape it, in an experience that can become closer and closer to lucid dreaming as skills improve.  Explaining why The All acts  Questions as to why God acts or doesn't act is an ancient question with many divergent answers. The same has been asked by Hermetics of the All, and many reasons have been put forth.(Three Initiates pp. 105-6) = The All has something to gain by acting = Some Hermetics believe that The All acts so that it may gain something from the action, for it must have a reason for acting, for having created the universe and our own existence. Critics of this idea argue that there is nothing outside of The All for it to gain, it is All.(Three Initiates p. 106) Meanwhile, proponents argue that the critics fail to recognize inner growth that allow the All to change by acting upon itself. = The All is compelled to act = Some Hermetics believe that The All acts because it is internally compelled to do so out of creative urge that is innate. Critics claim that The All is absolute and if this urge were to compel The All then it (the proposed urge) instead would be absolute .(Three Initiates pp. 106-7) = The All acts because it acts = The Kybalion claims simply that \\"THE ALL ACTS BECAUSE IT ACTS.\\" (cf. Actus purus) There is no reason but The All itself, therefore its action, itself, and its reason for action are all the same thing.(Three Initiates pp. 108-9)  Commentary on the All referred to as \\"The Father\\"  Though sometimes referred to as The Father, The All is not simply male. In this aspect, The All is called The Father for its active, masculine part in the creation of what is, not because of its physical sex. Similarly, that what it was created out of, is represented as The Mother, for its passive, feminine aspect in that same process. For example, we say Mother Earth and Mother Nature.  Different aspects of  The story describing The All here is not meant to be taken literally, but rather has symbolic meaning. Hermetics do not ever claim that the creation story used for this information is to be taken literally. The All has three aspects which are known as The Father and the \\"Sons of God,\\" put forth in the Corpus Hermeticum: = Nous = Nous bridges the gap between The All and its contents, and is described having taught Hermes Trismegistus his initial knowledge on God and the divine in Book 1 of the Corpus Hermeticum.(Way of Hermes p. 17) Manly P. Hall translates Nous differently, instead calling it \\"Thought (Thoth)\\", an Egyptian god generally seen as synonymous with Hermes. The terms Great Dragon, and Eternal Teacher also pop up for Nous in his translation. Nous is claimed also to be the Father of the Word, and only comes to pious and religious men.(Hall p.40) Nous claims to be God while the others are \\"sons of God\\" (Way of Hermes p. 18) It was Nous who is said to have created Man, both male and female (or hermaphroditic; some translations claiming \\"bisexual\\" used in a way to connote hermaphroditic), 7 of them, which were later broken up into separate men and women after falling in love with Nature, its shadow, and actually merging with Nature, or, in other words, incarnating.(Hall pp. 39-40) Hermes proclaims that Nous is the cause of existence and God should be worshipped by those two names, for they belong only to God. Nous, or God, is also seen as synonymous with the Supreme Good.(Way of Hermes pp. 28-9) = The Word = \\"Poimandres had spoken a Word. The Word was Reason\\" and Reason is given to The Workman, The Master-Builder, and The Maker of Things.(Hall p. 39) Nous and Reason are truly one, according to the Hermeticum, and their Union is Life. The Word is also known as The Logos.(Scott p. 3) The Word is used, by inhabiting the elements, to create destiny, the \\"seven governors\\" (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn of astrology) and was used to organize Chaos. The leaving of Reason from the elements is said to give rise to the lower creatures, who were created without Reason. See also Logos. = Anthropos = Anthropos (called the third son of God, while others see Nous‚Äîone of these sons of God‚Äîas the Father of the other two, and truly being God) is essentially the human soul which comes from God, and is destined to return to God. It is the part of man that is not material, the spiritual part of Man as opposed to the man's body (physical) or nous/mind (mental). It is further said that God is made up of innumerable souls, and if they conduct themselves properly, being true to themselves, they may become Powers of God,(Scott p. 4) which would lend credit to \\"The All has Something to Gain\\" theory for action. = Kybalion's ideas of God = The Kybalions interpretation of The ALL is that of a Substantial Reality,(Three Initiates pp. 53-5) and transcends names and terms(Three Initiates p. 55) and in essence is unknowable. It can be said that this corresponds to the ideas of or about the Tao, with respect to the interpretation of an all encompassing force above all other. There is little room in this view for a \\"god\\", for it is stated that the ALL transcends names and terms. For reasons of logic, the Kybalion goes further in stating that there can be nothing existing outside of the ALL, else the ALL would not be The ALL.(Three Initiates p. 59) Anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned cannot be The All.(Three Initiates p. 61) Possible origin Those seeking a deeper understanding of life will ask the question, \\"Where did The All come from?\\" Some Hermeticists, strong adherents of The Kybalion, go no further than to state \\"THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else to define, confine, bound, limit or restrict THE ALL. It must be infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,-- it must have always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to have ever created it ... if it had ever 'not been,' even for a moment, it would not 'be' now.\\" In 1975, Summum, an esoteric organization whose philosophy also includes the natural principles described in The Kybalion,(Ra Chap. 3) put forth an explanation behind The All's existence and claims the explanation came from \\"Summa Individuals\\",(Ra) beings who appear to be what The Kybalion describes as \\"Unseen Divinities\\" that intervene and assist with human affairs.(Three Initiates Chap. 8) Summum rewrote The Kybalion to include its explanation along with additional information.(Summum) Summum refers to The All as \\"SUMMUM,\\" a Latin term meaning \\"highest\\" or \\"greatest\\",(Mirza) and in the context of the Summum philosophy means, \\"the sum total of creation\\". The explanation Summum offers is based upon what it calls the \\"Grand Principle of Creation,\\" and via this grand principle, The All (SUMMUM) exists.(Ra Chap. 2) In summary, according to the Summum philosophy, The All is a union between Nothing and All Possibility, the ultimate opposites, and the nature of that union is without beginning or end for these two opposites automatically and simultaneously create each other. The result is a \\"cosmic copulation\\" whose effect is an infinite, living mind.

Bevan, which contained a foreword by Field Marshal William Slim. According to Bevan, the real Zarak Khan was an Afghan who spent most of his life fighting the British in the northwest frontier in the 1920s and 1930s. Among his crimes was the murder of a holy man. He eventually gave himself up and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Andaman Islands. However, when the Japanese occupied the islands he stayed in his cell. Khan was eventually given a suspended sentence and decided to work for the British in Burma. In 1943 he was leading a patrol when its British officer was killed in an ambush. He watched another British patrol be attacked by the Japanese and sent messengers to summon a Gurkha force. To stop the Japanese from escaping with their prisoners before the Gurkhas arrived, he attacked them single-handed, and killed or wounded six soldiers before being overpowered. He refused to be beheaded and insisted on being flayed alive to buy time to enable the Gurkhas to arrive. Development Warwick Films bought the film rights in 1953. Producer Irving Allen said he was more interested in the character of Zarak Khan than the events described in the book. He was contemplating changing Khan's nationality in order to offer the role to Errol Flynn. Eventually Allen decided to make a fictional account set in the 19th century. Regular Warwick writer Richard Maibaum was assigned the job of writing the script. The movie starred Victor Mature, who had signed a two-picture deal with Warwick. He made the film after making Safari for the company. Production Filming started in Morocco on 1 November 1955 with Yakima Canutt in charge of the second unit. Victor Mature joined the production on 19 November. Ted Moore, who handled some of the Technicolor/CinemaScope photography, later performed similar work on the early James Bond films, and art director John Box and costume designer Phyllis Dalton later won Oscars for their work on Doctor Zhivago. Richard Maibaum, who adapted A. J. Bevan's novel, went on to adapt such Ian Fleming novels as Dr. No, From Russia, with Love, and Goldfinger. Similarly, the director, Terence Young and co-producer, Albert R. Broccoli went on to create the Bond movies. Stuntman Bob Simmons, who performed and doubled several stars in the film, noted that Victor Mature refused to ride a horse. When his stunt double Jack Keely was killed in a horse accident on the set, Mature insisted on personally paying for his funeral.Simmons, Bob & Passingham, Kenneth Nobody Does It Better: My 25 Years of Stunts With James Bond and Other Stories Sterling Pub Co Inc (October 1987) Patrick McGoohan portrays Moor Larkin, an adjutant to Michael Wilding's character who has a penchant for billiards, as well as offering sensible, albeit ignored, advice. This role was commented on in the British cinema magazine, Picturegoer. The critic Margaret Hinxman made Patrick McGoohan her \\"Talent Spot\\". She assured readers that this new face would be \\"really something\\", given a \\"half-decent\\" part. She completely slated the film, however, describing it as \\"absurd\\".

A Grand Cross can also be viewed as two oppositions (180 degrees apart) separated from each other by a square. In a Grand Cross, there is one planet in each astrological element (fire, earth, air and water) but all the planets are in signs of the same modality or quality. Because all the aspects in a Grand Cross are considered difficult aspects, the Grand Cross is seen as a source of extreme tension whereby various aspects of the personality (represented by the planets) are working at cross purposes that serve to nullify each other. This pulls the native in many directions, ultimately leading to indecisiveness and an inability to produce concrete achievements. It is said to take extraordinary effort to overcome the conflicts in a Grand Cross. An example of a Grand Cross would be with Saturn at 15¬∞ Virgo, Uranus at 15¬∞ Sagittarius, Neptune at 15¬∞ Gemini and Pluto at 15¬∞ Pisces. This is a mutable Grand Cross, which is said to be especially difficult with respect to the problem of maintaining focus in communication. A cardinal Grand Cross is said to cause a particular difficulty in accomplishing goals because the individual wants to accomplish everything at the same time. As a result, this can cause problems in retaining the concentration needed to accomplish tasks. A fixed Grand Cross is said to lead to a person who is well organized but does not know where to direct their talents. Consequently, those with a fixed grand cross tend to be stuck in the same place. People with many squares in their horoscope, however, if they work hard enough at overcoming the conflicts thus involved, are said to be able to achieve remarkable personal growth and self-fulfillment.  T-Square  When one of the four signs of any modality or quality does not contain any planet - or only contains planets that would be out of orb for a Grand Cross - then a T-Square is said to be formed. The energy of T-Square is similar to a Grand Cross, but it is much weaker because it involves only three planets; in which two of them form an opposition and a square with the third. Due to lesser energy emitted by the T-Square, individuals with this planetary configuration feel that there is something lacking and therefore have to supply what they think is lacking for better integration of their personality. Filling the gap posed by the T-Square in their personal makeup is the solution to take control of the stressful energies of this aspect and channel them into constructive use. Many successful professionals and otherwise outstanding people often have this configuration in their chart. One particular example of a Cross, which was not a Grand Cross, came during the summer of 2010 (July 10), when Pluto (in Capricorn), Uranus and Jupiter (in Aries) and the Moon (in Gemini moving into Cancer) were at 0-3¬∞ Capricorn, Aries and Cancer, respectively, with Saturn being out of mode at 29 Virgo. This was assumed by astrologers studying mundane astrology that it would be a time with many great challenges and dramatic changes.http://www.mountainastrologer.com/planet_tracks/pt_archive/nept_pluto/nept_pluto.html As the Moon moved out of orb, this Cross quickly (within a day) became a T-Square. This aspect resembled a T-Square that occurred during the 1930s.http://www.astrologyforthesoul.com/billstreett/2010alignment.html  References  Category:Astrological aspects ","title":"Grand cross (astrology)"},{"id":"3905367","text":"Dano is a town located in the province of Ioba in Burkina Faso.

Planning for the series started in 1989, but the animation process did not start until 1991. The series was released on DVD in 2001 by Central Park Media in the United States, in 2002 by Happinet Pictures in Japan, and in 1997 by Manga Entertainment in the United Kingdom. Orgun later appeared in the Super Robot Wars W video game. Plot =Part 1 ‚Äì Birth= Tomoru Shindo, a college student from City 5, is having dreams of a mecha named Orgun and protecting a woman from an hostile mecha. A meteor enters Earth's atmosphere and heads for City 5, revealing itself to be a hostile mecha from an alien race called the Evoluder. Earth Defense Force (EDF) Professor Michi Kanzaki receives signals from the Moon that are coming from a crash-landed mecha named Orgun, and rebuilds it in her laboratory. Orgun escapes and confronts the invading mecha, inviting Tomoru to merge with him. Together, the two defeat the mecha. Tomoru learns that Orgun is a defector from the invading Evoluder, who plan to destroy Earth with the battle planet Zoma's antimatter cannon. The blind oracle Kumi Jefferson predicts the planet's destruction. =Part 2 ‚Äì Pursuit= The EDF create robotic suits based on Orgun in order to defend Earth. Orgun and Tomoru meet two of the Evoluder: Leave, who dies protecting Orgun, and Rang, who battles Orgun in anger for his treason. It is revealed that the Evoluder are the descendants of a manned space mission Earth sent to the Cygnus constellation 200 years earlier, whose crew evolved into mechanical lifeforms due to experiencing millions of years of time dilation during the journey. Some of the Evoluder are telepathically linked to certain humans, such as Tomoru with Orgun and Kumi with the Evoluder's leader, Mhiku. =Part 3 ‚Äì Showdown= Using their robotic suits, the EDF repels the Evoluder's invasion force. Kumi uses her telekinetic powers to move the Sun so Orgun can save the Earth. Zoa, the Evoluder's military commander, fires the antimatter cannon. Orgun uses his Grand Cross attack to kill Zoa and destroy the cannon. Orgun crashes onto a beach and dies while Tomoru survives. Mhiku resumes ruling the Evoluder, who peacefully leave Earth. Tomoru and Kanzaki walk off into the sunset while Orgun's remains are displayed in a museum.

Hirasawa took the role because of a wish to work with producer Satoshi Koizumi, whose personality drew Hirasawa in after requesting him to dispel the image that anime soundtracks had. The composer was asked to write the anime's main theme first, and it was presented to Koizumi and director Masami ≈åbari in late 1990, before animation had started. Hirasawa wrote and performed all the music for the OVA, in his film score composer debut (previous soundtrack work amounted to commercial jingles and pro wrestling entrance themes). Similarly to his solo albums Water in Time and Space, The Ghost in Science and Virtual Rabbit, Hirasawa mixed together electronic and symphonic sounds, using elements across a broad range of music styles, with a large focus on classical music. At the time, Hirasawa thought of anime and movie soundtracks only as enhancements and not as standalone works, and made the soundtracks considering it as \\"a job\\" and \\"entertainment\\", employing an epic tone and dramatic exaggeration in his composing. He drew songwriting elements from his solo albums throughout the soundtrack, and used already-made songs from them as ending themes and insert songs. The first soundtrack was made simultaneously with Virtual Rabbit, and was made by Hirasawa basing himself on production materials. Detonator Orgun 3 was entirely recorded on Hirasawa's private Studio Wireself. Hirasawa eventually got tired of working on the series, and considered Detonator Orgun 3 to be the worst album of his solo career, yet also considers the experience helpful in making later soundtracks, in particular the music for the Berserk series, and regards the \\"grand and delicate\\" technique for orchestral tones he developed through this soundtrack as guidance for his later works in general. Series writer enjoyed the soundtrack, later commissioning Hirasawa to compose for his fantasy manga Glory Wars; this music was later released as an image mini-album of the same name. To promote the album, the remix of \\"Bandiria Travellers\\" (used as the ending theme of episode 1) was released a month ahead as a single and a sampler Mini CD, while the opening and ending themes of episode 1 were distributed to interested parties. In addition to the episode soundtracks, a drama CD was also released, containing select music from the soundtracks and audio from the series itself. The series' main theme was included on the 2007 compilation Music For Movies: World of Susumu Hirasawa Soundtracks. Hirasawa had the soundtracks remastered for the 2012 boxset Haldyn Dome; his former record label did the same for the 2014 compilation Symphonic Code (since those were catalog-wide projects, songs that were also present on other albums were omitted to avoid duplication, being either included on earlier discs of the boxset or on the Archetype compilation). Glory Wars was bundled together with the soundtracks for these reissues. Hirasawa has seldom brought up his soundtracks for the series in his overall career. Some P-Model material originated out of the soundtrack. In his 1994 shows, the title theme was played over the PA system before they began; Hirasawa usually opened his shows with \\"Frozen Beach '94\\", a rearrangement of \\"YOHKO Mitsurugi\\" with the lyrics of \\"Frozen Beach\\". A studio recording of this version, simply titled \\"FROZEN BEACH\\", was released a year later on the Scuba Recycle album. =Personnel= *Susumu Hirasawa ‚Äì Synthesizers, Drum machine, Sampler, Sequencers, Amiga 2500, Programming, Vocals, Electric guitar, Classical guitar, Production * ‚Äì Backing Vocals on \\"Bandiria Travellers\\" *Teru Uchida Strings ‚Äì Strings on \\"Bandiria Travellers\\" and \\"SUNSET\\" *Jun Togawa ‚Äì Vocals on \\"Clear Mountain Top\\" *, Osamu Takeuchi and Ch≈´ju Yamaguchi ‚Äì Backing Vocals on \\"Clear Mountain Top\\" *Shingo Tomoda ‚Äì Drums on \\"Venus\\" *Kayo \\"Kokubo\\" Matsumoto ‚Äì Acoustic Piano on \\"Water in Time and Space (Full Size)\\" * Section ‚Äì Violins, Cellos, Violas and Contrabasses on \\"Root of Spirit\\" *Yoshiaki Kondo ‚Äì Engineering on \\"Venus\\" and \\"Root of Spirit\\" *Masanori Chinzei ‚Äì Engineering, Backing Vocals on \\"Clear Mountain Top\\" *Y≈´ichi Kenjo ‚Äì Executive Production, Backing Vocals on \\"Clear Mountain Top\\" *Michitaka Kikuchi ‚Äì Illustrations (1 & 2) *Masami ≈åbari ‚Äì Illustrations (3) Reception Detonator Orgun has received mostly mixed reception. Ben Carlton of Manga Mania praised the series' art: \\"Tomoru lives in a future world which is bright, clean, and scarily antiseptic. The military look like plastic toys in their chunky armour and craft. [...] skies are as rich and beautiful as any in Macross Plus\\". He also noted that: \\"Tomoru's world is also sharp and crisp as only anime can make it, with every edge and colour defined, giving more tension to the robot battles and dream sequences, where with every major change or impact the image loses definition in a sudden blur of brightness or shadow.\\" On the other hand, Carlton criticized the UK dub's mixing, describing it as \\"sadly, disappointing, with uneven levels and what sounds like some nice music almost drowned out.\\" Helen McCarthy in 500 Essential Anime Movies called the anime an \\"intriguingly fresh take on the traditions of giant robot shows\\", noting that three \\"hour-long episodes allow plenty of time to develop concepts and characters\\". Paul Thomas Chapman, writing retrospectively for Otaku USA, criticized the series, stating that \\"it starts off dull, proceeds to take an interesting twist and mangle it beyond recognition, and concludes in a manner that can only be described as complete and utter nonsense, even by anime standards\\". When he talks about a scene where Kumi moves the sun with telekinetic powers, Chapman states \\"I don't have enough exclamations points to describe how ridiculous that is.\\" Comparing the series to other works by its staff, he notes that \\"it's no surprise that the themes explored in Detonator Orgun‚Äîtrans-humanism, the loneliness of space, the cyclical nature of history, and the sense of futility experienced by cultures consumed by war‚Äîare so similar to those explored in Gall Force [...] But whereas Gall Force felt like a sincere work of popular science-fiction, Orgun feels like [Hideki] Kakinuma repeating himself, chewing over an idea he's already examined more thoroughly and with greater skill. As for future utopias and transformation as a metaphor for self-actualization, I've seen this kind of imagery from Masami Obari before and since,\\" comparing the series to Angel Blade.

He was suspected of being a Soviet spy and in 1974, he was charged with trying to pass New Zealand Government information to the Soviet Union. He was acquitted, an outcome that was the subject of much debate since then. Although there were subsequent disclosures from the KGB which indicated that he may have been a spy, no definitive proof that he was has ever been uncovered. Early life Sutch was born in Southport, England in 1907, but his family moved to New Zealand when he was eight months old. His father, Ebenezer (Ted) Sutch, was a journeyman carpenter, and his mother, Ellen Sutch (n√©e Ball), a dressmaker. He grew up in the Methodist faith, which was to have a strong influence on him throughout his life. He went to Wellington College, then the Wellington College of Education and Victoria University College (later Victoria University of Wellington) where he gained a MA and B.Com. His field of interest at University, particularly, was in the English Poor Law, and it is this work that led to a fellowship being offered to Columbia University, the offer effectively a prize for his work up till then. Before taking this up he had taught at Nelson College (he did much of his degrees part-time, while teaching) and Wanganui Technical College. At Columbia he was awarded a PhD in Economics in 1932 on \\"Price fixing in New Zealand. After some travel he then returned to New Zealand which was experiencing the Great Depression. The Depression, and his family's position also, deeply affected his personal philosophy. Sutch in 1931 In April 1933, Sutch was one of four people that included Morva Williams, his future wife, who were reported missing in the Tararua Range during an attempt to be the first to follow a particular route during the winter season. The trip was scheduled to take two days, but they were delayed when two of the members were injured in a fall and all were forced to travel very slowly through some of the worst weather recorded, before finally making their way out more than two weeks later. Once noticed missing, the resultant search became the largest search and rescue operation in New Zealand up until that time, involving around 200 people. Career Politically, Sutch was generally on the left, although his wide network of friends included people of all political persuasions, and perhaps the person he most admired was the centre-right politician Gordon Coates. He was involved in a number of left-leaning organisations and associations, and helped edit and publish literature connected with them. In 1939, he assisted the publication of \\"Psycho-pathology in Politics\\", written by Labour Party dissident John A. Lee which was an attack on the party's leader, Michael Joseph Savage. Sutch wrote numerous books. Among the first were: Poverty and Progress in New Zealand (1941, 1969), which echoed the work Progress and Poverty, by the Californian Henry George (1879), known as the \\"single [land] taxer\\"; and The Quest for Security in New Zealand (1942, 1966)., which to Sutch was a related topic. =Early career= In 1933, following some teaching in Palmerston North Boys' High School, Sutch took up a position in the office of Gordon Coates, who was Minister of Finance. When the government changed, he continued on in the office of Coates's successor, Walter Nash of the First Labour Government. He had considerable input into economic policy at the time. Eventually, Sutch's political activities were deemed incompatible with his official role, and he was transferred out of the economic sphere. He left the civil service to join the army, becoming an instructor. He returned to the Ministry of Supply arranging equipment and finance. =Work overseas= At the end of the war, he took up a position with the new United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), working in Sydney and then in London, covering war-devastated Europe. As a result of this work, he was selected to head the New Zealand delegation to the United Nations, where he held positions with the Economic and Social Commission and UNICEF. He played a crucial role in a UN decision to continue with UNICEF, despite a United States desire to close it down. Ben Alpers has said that some of the credit for UNICEF's Nobel Prize for Peace should go to Sutch and New Zealand. Soviet documents claim he was recruited as a spy in 1950.http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion- post/news/10369208/Fresh-twist-in-40-year-old-Cold-War-spy-mystery =Return to New Zealand= Sutch in 1958 Upon returning to New Zealand in 1951, Sutch worked for the Department of Industries and Commerce, eventually in 1958 rising to be its Secretary. The First National Government had blocked Sutch's promotion to the head of the department because of an American threat that they would regard New Zealand's security as suspect (The United States communicated secret information to its ANZUS and SEATO allies which included New Zealand). Leading National Party MPs openly regarded Sutch to be a Communist. However the Second Labour Government appointed Sutch to be permanent head of the department. Prime Minister Walter Nash, who knew Sutch well, ignored the objections of the Security Service who thought an appointment was not worth compromising allegiance to the United States. Nash's biographer described Sutch's elevation as a \\"courageous decision\\". There he promoted the development of the New Zealand economy using the policy instruments of the day, including price controls, subsidies and import controls. He concluded that pastoral exports by themselves would not generate enough foreign exchange to maintain full employment, and would continue to make the economy highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international conditions. So he sought import substitution, the further processing of agricultural production for export, and the exporting of non-pastoral agricultural exports, manufacturing and services (such as tourism). As such he foresaw, championed and laid the foundations of the great export diversifications of the 1970s. Sutch's promotion of industrialisation was anathema to much of the farming community, though many in the business community supported him. In March 1965 he was forced to retire after 40 years of public service employment and at the age of 57 he became a consultant. Among his many further publications were the books, Colony or Nation?, The Responsible Society in New Zealand, Takeover New Zealand, and Women with a Cause. His festschrift, Spirit of an Age, was published in 1975. Sutch became active in the arts and architectural communities, including the Wellington Architectural Centre. He was an early and active promoter of New Zealand design, asserting that quality design was central to economic and social development. He helped to set up the Wellington Architectural Centre, provided the intellectual framework that led to the formation of the New Zealand Industrial Design Council and chaired the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council (now Creative New Zealand).Christopher Thompson, 'Modernizing for trade: institutionalizing design promotion in New Zealand, 1958-1967', Journal of Design History, vol 24, no 3 (2011), pp. 223-239. =Legacy= Sutch's writing provides one of the most comprehensive accounts of, and visions for, New Zealand. While his views were often original and independent, many that were rejected at the time are now accepted. He was a nation-builder who wanted to see an economically strong and socially fair New Zealand, free from colonial ties, whether economic or political. He was a committed nationalist, and on many matters ahead of his times. Economist Brian Easton has argued that: \\"The events surrounding the trial overshadowed the significance of what went before, and have muted subsequent recognition of his intellectual contributions.\\" The trial also overshadowed his role in the establishment of UNICEF. Sutch's daughter, Helen Sutch, said after the declassification of New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents in 2008 said: \\"Our family hopes that justice can now be done to that historic legacy, which has been overshadowed for so long by events in the last year of his life\\". Controversy =Charges under the Official Secrets Act= In September 1974, Sutch was arrested and charged under the Official Secrets Act 1951 following a series of clandestine meetings with KGB agent Dimitri Rasgovorov, an official of the Soviet Union's embassy in Wellington. Sutch was the only New Zealander ever to stand trial under the espionage provisions of the Official Secrets Act, based on the British Act of 1951 and repealed in 1983. The SIS aimed to catch Sutch passing on information during a meeting at night in a public park, but did not detain Sutch until after Rasgovorov had left. They assumed Sutch would co-operate once caught red handed. When he did not, they could not provide specific details of what information Sutch had passed to the Soviet diplomat (hence the curious charge that he faced, under the Official Secrets Act, of passing unspecified information to the Soviet Union). Sutch claimed his meetings with Soviet officials were after the Russian ostensibly approached him in his capacity as a stalwart of the NZ Friends of Israel, for information about who were the Zionists in New Zealand, and to discuss China. At trial the SIS claimed that the retired Sutch had obtained official government information to give to the Soviets but was unable to provide details of what information. Following a high-profile trial, a jury acquitted Sutch of the charges in February 1975. Sutch began to suffer ill health at about the same time as he was arrested and died from liver cancer six months after the trial on 28 September 1975 at Wellington, shortly after holding his just-born first grandson, Piers. =Subsequent contemporary debate= Debate over his guilt or innocence continued long after his death. A book published in 2006 by C.H (Kit) Bennetts, the SIS officer who had first observed Sutch, reasserted the claim that he was guilty. In an editorial, the New Zealand Herald applauded the publication of the book, and said \\"Bennetts' unauthorised account has done the SIS a service\\". On 9 May 2008, most of the SIS file on the Sutch and the trial were declassified. The files contained no new material information. On the other hand a Top Secret 1976 report by chief ombudsman Sir Guy Powles found that SIS actions had been unlawful when they burgled and bugged his office. In August 2014, the University of Cambridge released details from the KGB files from the Wellington Embassy that they held in archives that had been provided by Soviet defector Vasili Mitrokhin in 1992 . According to Phil Kitchen of The Dominion Post, \\"The documents don't name Sutch but the details clearly identify him and state he was recruited [by the KGB] in 1950.\\" If the person was indeed Sutch, he was recruited while representing New Zealand at the United Nations, and continued contact with the KGB for 24 years, including 15 years when he was employed in high Government office. Sutch's daughter did not accept the evidence, stating: \\"It is well known that KGB agents in general were desperate to talk up any contacts they had because they were under pressure from their superiors\\". Personal life On 12 January 1934 at Wellington, Bill Sutch married Morva Milburn Williams, a schoolteacher. There were no children of the marriage. His marriage to Morva was dissolved on 2 February 1944, and he married Shirley Hilda Stanley Smith (1916‚Äì2008), a lecturer and later a lawyer, in Auckland on 2 June that year. They had one daughter, Helen, who was economic adviser to Prime Minister David Lange and rose to a prominent position with the World Bank.http://www.wellington-girls.school.nz/hall-of-fame/helen-sutch Two biographies have been published of Shirely and her marriage to Sutch; Shirley Smith: An Examined Life Sarah Gaitanos 2019 was shortlisted for the Ockhams award. In 2020 her son in law, Keith Ovenden, published \\"Bill and Shirley ‚Äì a memoir\\" which does not mention Gaitanos' biograpghy, (the family had withdrawn cooperation during the writing of it). https://www.newsroom.co.nz/book-of-the- week-aro-valley-confidential References Further reading  External links *Sutch's entry in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography (also available on Brian Easton's personal website) *Brian Easton's analysis of Sutch's alleged spying activities *SIS Target Assessment of W.

It is located on New Zealand State Highway 94, the main road linking Gore with the tourist destination of Milford Sound.  Railway  In 1880, the Waimea Plains Railway was opened; it linked Gore on the Main South Line with Lumsden on the Kingston Branch and passed through Balfour. The line was an important economic link for many years, and the original Kingston Flyers that gave their name to today's Kingston Flyer tourist train in Kingston passed through Balfour on their way to Gore or Dunedin from the 1890s through to Easter 1957. With the improvement of road transportation and changes in government regulations, the railway lost its profitability, and in 1971, most of it was closed. Balfour now became the terminus of a short branch line from Lumsden, and it was hoped that shipments of wheat from surrounding farms would provide sufficient traffic to keep the line open. Unfortunately, the quantities of traffic desired from Balfour did not eventuate and the railway was closed on 15 January 1978. Today, the old Balfour station platform has been incorporated into a children's playground.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 111-12.  Economy  The town's industry is predominantly agricultural. In the surrounding area, cattle, sheep, grain, and deer are farmed. A dairy factory once operated in the town. Dairy farming has again become economically important in recent years. A lime works, started in 1910, recently closed.Northern Southland Naturally, \\"Balfour\\" , accessed 3 November 2007.

It produces artificial wavefronts synthesized by a large number of individually driven loudspeakers. Such wavefronts seem to originate from a virtual starting point, the virtual source or notional source. Contrary to traditional spatialization techniques such as stereo or surround sound, the localization of virtual sources in WFS does not depend on or change with the listener's position.  Physical fundamentals  WFS is based on the Huygens‚ÄìFresnel principle, which states that any wavefront can be regarded as a superposition of elementary spherical waves. Therefore, any wavefront can be synthesized from such elementary waves. In practice, a computer controls a large array of individual loudspeakers and actuates each one at exactly the time when the desired virtual wavefront would pass through it. The basic procedure was developed in 1988 by Professor A.J. Berkhout at the Delft University of Technology. Its mathematical basis is the Kirchhoff‚ÄìHelmholtz integral. It states that the sound pressure is completely determined within a volume free of sources, if sound pressure and velocity are determined in all points on its surface. :\\\\boldsymbol{P}(w,z)=\\\\iint_{dA} \\\\left(G(w,z \\\\vert z') \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial n} P(w,z')- P(w,z') \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial n} G(w,z \\\\vert z') \\\\right)dz' Therefore, any sound field can be reconstructed, if sound pressure and acoustic velocity are restored on all points of the surface of its volume. This approach is the underlying principle of holophony. For reproduction, the entire surface of the volume would have to be covered with closely spaced loudspeakers, each individually driven with its own signal. Moreover, the listening area would have to be anechoic, in order to avoid sound reflections that would violate source-free volume assumption. In practice, this is hardly feasible. Because our acoustic perception is most exact in the horizontal plane, practical approaches generally reduce the problem to a horizontal loudspeaker line, circle or rectangle around the listener. The origin of the synthesized wavefront can be at any point on the horizontal plane of the loudspeakers. For sources behind the loudspeakers, the array will produce convex wavefronts. Sources in front of the speakers can be rendered by concave wavefronts that focus in the virtual source and diverge again. Hence the reproduction inside the volume is incomplete - it breaks down if the listener sits between speakers and inner virtual source. The origin represents the virtual acoustic source, which approximates an acoustic source at the same position. Unlike conventional (stereo) reproduction, the perceived position of the virtual sources is independent of listener position allowing the listener to move or giving an entire audience consistent perception of audio source location.  Procedural advantages  A sound field with very stable position of the acoustic sources can be established using wave field synthesis. In principle, it is possible to establish a virtual copy of a genuine sound field indistinguishable from the real sound. Changes of the listener position in the rendition area can produce the same impression as an appropriate change of location in the recording room. Listeners are no longer relegated to a sweet spot area within the room. The Moving Picture Expert Group standardized the object-oriented transmission standard MPEG-4 which allows a separate transmission of content (dry recorded audio signal) and form (the impulse response or the acoustic model). Each virtual acoustic source needs its own (mono) audio channel. The spatial sound field in the recording room consists of the direct wave of the acoustic source and a spatially distributed pattern of mirror acoustic sources caused by the reflections by the room surfaces. Reducing that spatial mirror source distribution onto a few transmitting channels causes a significant loss of spatial information. This spatial distribution can be synthesized much more accurately by the rendition side. Compared to conventional channel-orientated rendition procedures, WFS provides a clear advantage: Virtual acoustic sources guided by the signal content of the associated channels can be positioned far beyond the conventional material rendition area. This reduces the influence of the listener position because the relative changes in angles and levels are clearly smaller compared to conventional loudspeakers located within the rendition area. This extends the sweet spot considerably; it can now cover nearly the entire rendition area. WFS thus is not only compatible with, but potentially improves the reproduction for conventional channel-oriented methods.  Challenges  = Sensitivity to room acoustics = Since WFS attempts to simulate the acoustic characteristics of the recording space, the acoustics of the rendition area must be suppressed. One possible solution is use of acoustic damping or to otherwise arrange the walls in an absorbing and non-reflective configuration. A second possibility is playback within the near field. For this to work effectively the loudspeakers must couple very closely at the hearing zone or the diaphragm surface must be very large. In some cases, the most perceptible difference compared to the original sound field is the reduction of the sound field to two dimensions along the horizontal of the loudspeaker lines. This is particularly noticeable for reproduction of ambience. The suppression of acoustics in the rendition area does not complement playback of natural acoustic ambient sources. = Aliasing = There are undesirable spatial aliasing distortions caused by position- dependent narrow-band break-downs in the frequency response within the rendition range. Their frequency depends on the angle of the virtual acoustic source and on the angle of the listener to the loudspeaker arrangement: :f_{\\\\text{alias}}=\\\\frac{c}{\\\\Delta x \\\\left \\\\sin\\\\Theta^{\\\\text{sec}} - \\\\sin\\\\Theta^{\\\\text{v}} \\\\right} For aliasing-free rendition in the entire audio range a distance of the single emitters below 2 cm would be necessary. But fortunately our ear is not particularly sensitive to spatial aliasing. A 10‚Äì15 cm emitter distance is generally sufficient. = Truncation effect = Another cause for disturbance of the spherical wavefront is the truncation effect. Because the resulting wavefront is a composite of elementary waves, a sudden change of pressure can occur if no further speakers deliver elementary waves where the speaker row ends. This causes a 'shadow-wave' effect. For virtual acoustic sources placed in front of the loudspeaker arrangement this pressure change hurries ahead of the actual wavefront whereby it becomes clearly audible. In signal processing terms, this is spectral leakage in the spatial domain and is caused by application of a rectangular function as a window function on what would otherwise be an infinite array of speakers. The shadow wave can be reduced if the volume of the outer loudspeakers is reduced; this corresponds to using a different window function which tapers off instead of being truncated. = High cost = A further and resultant problem is high cost. A large number of individual transducers must be very close together. Reducing the number of transducers by increasing their spacing introduces spatial aliasing artifacts. Reducing the number of transducers at a given spacing reduces the size of the emitter field and limits the representation range; outside of its borders no virtual acoustic sources can be produced.  Research and market maturity  2-dimensional placement of wavefront synthesis speaker arrays. Early development of WFS began 1988 at Delft University. Further work was carried out from January 2001 to June 2003 in the context of the CARROUSO project by the European Union which included ten institutes. The WFS sound system IOSONO was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for digital media technology (IDMT) by the Technical University of Ilmenau in 2004. The first live WFS transmission took place in July 2008, recreating an organ recital at Cologne Cathedral in lecture hall 104 of the Technical University of Berlin. The room contains the world‚Äôs largest speaker system with 2700 loudspeakers on 832 independent channels. Research trends in wave field synthesis include the consideration of psychoacoustics to reduce the necessary number of loudspeakers, and to implement complicated sound radiation properties so that a virtual grand piano sounds as grand as in real life.

The club are currently members of the and play at Watton Sports Centre. History The club was established in 1888 and for over half a century played in local leagues.Blakeman, M (2010) The Official History of the Eastern Counties Football League 1935-2010, Volume II They won the Dereham & District League in 1949‚Äì50 and were elected to Division Two of the East Anglian League. They won the division at the first attempt, and were promoted to Division One. In 1952‚Äì53 they won the league cup. After the league merged into the Anglian Combination in 1964, Watton won the league and league cup double in 1966‚Äì67. They won the league again the following season and won the league cup for a second time in 1969‚Äì70. The club were relegated to Division One at the end of the 1974‚Äì75 season, but made an immediate return after finishing as runners-up the following season. They won the Premier Division again in 1985‚Äì86 and were promoted to the Eastern Counties League. In their first season in the ECL they finished eighth, and won the Norfolk Senior Cup for the first time with a 3‚Äì1 win over Poringland United. In 1989‚Äì90 they drew 19 of their 40 matches, an ECL record. After the club's floodlights failed standards tests, they were unable to meet ECL requirements and resigned from the league in April 2000. The following season they took their reserves' place in Division Two of the Anglian Combination. They finished second in their first season in the division, earning promotion to Division One. The following season they were Division One champions and were promoted to the Premier Division. They were relegated back to Division One at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, but returned after finishing as runners-up in 2007‚Äì08. They were relegated back to Division One at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. Prior to the 2013‚Äì14 season financial problems caused the club to withdraw its first team from Division One, with the first team taking over from the reserves in Division Five.Debts threaten the future of Watton United Eastern Daily Press, 8 September 2013 The club finished third in Division Five, and were promoted to Division Four at the end of the season. In 2014‚Äì15 they were promoted again after finishing fourth, and went on to win Division Three in 2015‚Äì16, earning promotion to Division Two. A third-place finish in Division Two in 2016‚Äì17 saw them win promotion to Division One. Ground The club were already playing at the Memorial Sports Field before it became the town's sports centre in 1974. A record attendance of 1,000 was set for the official switch on of new floodlights, a match against Norwich City on 30 April 1985. The ground only has three sides as it also incorporates a cricket pitch. A large extension to the sports centre resulted in the club having the largest tea bar in non- League football.

The dance involves the dancers moving one after another, shaking their bottoms and shoulders quickly. It was traditionally accompanied by the bendr√©, a gourd drum with a sheep's skin. = Nabasga Festival = Around the first week of July every year, the customary festival of Nabasga is held in the town of Zorgho to pay homage to ancestors. The festival, held by the chief of the town, the Naba Sanem of Zorgho, consists of a ritual of sacrifice to thank the ancestors for the past season and implore their blessing for the one that begins. The party begins with a secret retreat of the chief from the village for a few days. His return to the palace marks the official beginning of the festivities. On the morning of Saturday, the dance troupes set up in the vicinity of the royal palace. Warba, maranse, yarma, liwaga, ki√®gba and other dances are performed to lively music. Meanwhile, the chief, with his notables, receives hundreds of high-ranking guests arriving from across the area to his palace. On the evening of Saturday around 5 pm, the chief leaves the town on horseback, accompanied by his ministers, his notables and some women of the royal family, each carrying a basket on their head. It simulates a journey whose destination is an old market place located a few hundred meters from the palace, where he makes three laps before making the sacrifice. In the vicinity of the path leading to this place, in front of and behind the chief, thousands of people make the movement to observe the ritual. After the chief returns to the palace, some go to see the dancers, and others go to the bar to drink beer. The party officially ends with the tour of the market by the \\"queens\\", 3 days later. An appointment is then made for the festival of the next year.

Her most famous work is the Brambly Hedge series, published from 1980. Early life Jill Barklem was born as Gillian Gaze in Epping on 23 May 1951. Educated at Loughton High School, after an accident when she was thirteen resulting in a detached retina, she was unable to take part in PE or games at school and instead developed her talent for drawing and art. On leaving school, she studied illustration at St Martin's in London. Illustrator After graduating she became an illustrator for children's bibles. Her husband suggested that she turn her ideas conceived while commuting on the train journey to art school for a story about hedgerow life into a book. Barklem became a full-time illustrator, working on the expanding series of books about the mice of Brambly Hedge. She spent five years on research before she started to write her first stories about them. Family life Barklem married David Barklem in 1977; they had two children.

Amstelveen is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands and is part of the metropolitan area of Amsterdam. Confusingly, all built structures at the north-eastern end of the course fall under jurisdiction of the city of Amsterdam. The Bosbaan (literal translation: Woods Course) is the oldest artificial rowing course in the world. The course was built in 1936 as part of an employment project and originally had five lanes, but was then widened to six lanes in 1954 when Amsterdam hosted the European Rowing Championships, the first international event where women were allowed to participate as elite rowers. Following a major renovation in 2001, the Bosbaan measures 2200 metres in length, 118 metres across and features 8 lanes. In this reconstruction the boat storage facilities were also doubled in size, and the old grandstand demolished. In July 2005 the first international championships (since the expansion of 2001) took place at the Bosbaan: the WU23 (World Championships Under 23). In 2006, the rowing course hosted the World Junior Championships and in 2007, it was the site of the 2nd Rowing World Cup Regatta. In 2014 it hosted the 2014 World Rowing Championships. The Bosbaan hosts both the Olympic Training Centre for the national rowing association (KNRB) and the Vrije Universiteit student rowing club R.S.V.U. 'Okeanos'. Both are housed in a modern dedicated training and club facility, designed to be reminiscent of the former grandstand. The venue is popular for leisure activities such as recreational running (the marked perimeter path is 5 km); running events; dragonboat races and angling. The Bosbaan lies in parallel with the approach to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol's runway 09/27, at approx 2 km distance.

Broadcast on Saturday nights on Yle TV1 since 1998, the show received very high viewing figures. Uutisvuoto was aired on Yle TV1 from 1998 until May 2018, then moved to MTV3 in January 2019. Uutisvuoto mainly follows the same format as Have I Got News For You. The guests are usually celebrities, and frequently politicians. In two presidential elections, both of the second-round candidates appeared as guests: to-be-president Tarja Halonen and Esko Aho in 2000, and president Halonen and Sauli Niinist√∂ in 2006. Winning the show correlated with winning the election contest itself in both instances. In 2006, the \\"presidential show\\" broke all viewing records when it was watched by 1.4 million viewers (in a country of 5.2 million). The show was so popular in Finland that it was even parodied in the Aku Ankka (Finnish for Donald Duck) comic book as Uutiskuono (news muzzle/snout). \\"Haluatteko lukea hyv√§n vitsin jonka kuulin √§sken Yleisradion kahvilassa?\\" (\\"Do you want to read a good joke which I just heard at the Yleisradio's cafeteria?\\") () is Peter Nyman's Uutisvuoto joke book. The book's name is a reference to Nyman's way of telling jokes. He opens with the book's name, then, ignoring all answers, continues: \\"Ei se mit√§√§n, kerron sen silti.\\" (\\"Doesn't matter, I'll tell it anyway.\\") Performers The host of Uutisvuoto was originally Peter Nyman. In 2010, journalist Baba Lybeck took over. Novelist Jari Tervo was one of the permanent team captains for the entire history of the show until 2017. His pair was originally poet Tommy Tabermann, who resigned after being elected to the Finnish parliament in 2006. Tabermann was eventually replaced by comedian Stan Saanila until 2017. Both teams also included a weekly guest member, often a politician or a journalist. *Baba Lybeck (presenter 2010‚Äì2018) *Peter Nyman (presenter 1998‚Äì2010; 2019‚Äìpresent) *Jari Tervo (captain 1998‚Äì2017) *Stan Saanila (captain 2007‚Äì2017; 2019‚Äìpresent) *Tommy Tabermann (captain 1998‚Äì2007) *Ile Uusivuori (captain 2019‚Äìpresent) References External links * Official site (in Finnish) * Category:Finnish comedy television series Category:Finnish game shows Category:1990s Finnish television series Category:1998 Finnish television series debuts Category:Finnish television series based on British television series Category:2018 Finnish television series endings ","title":"Uutisvuoto"},{"id":"3905638","text":"Driller (known as Space Station Oblivion in the United States) is a 1987 puzzle video game. It was written by British developers Major Developments and published by Incentive Software for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS. It uses the Freescape 3D game engine. Plot In the far future, the human race has abandoned Earth for the reaches of outer space, having ruined the planet in the relentless quest for resources and in endless conflict. In a desperate search to find a new home, they found Evath, a life-sustaining planet with two moons, Mitral and Tricuspid. They sent a ship, named \\"Exodus\\" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath. Lesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation. His grandfather had been a member of the Federation, but he was falsely accused of murder and banished as a Ketar. Only later did the evidence contesting his guilt surface, but it was too late - the law did not allow someone banished as a Ketar to return to Evath. Lesleigh was not bitter and did not seek retribution. He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again. Called in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe. Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe \\"Last Hope\\" to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster. Things are not so simple though, with the security systems activated prior to the Ketars' departure. Gameplay The game requires the player to maneuver the excavation probe, through a first-person view, through eighteen regions (in the shape of a rhombicuboctahedron) of the moon Mitral, and place a drilling rig in each of them to allow a minimum of 50% of the gas to escape. The position is established by a mixture of clues from the landscape (including an \\"X marks the spot\\" in the first zone) and trial and error. The security systems will attack Lesleigh upon sight, and he must disable or avoid them by any means possible. Only a few can be destroyed by shooting, while the rest must be dispatched by mechanical means through switches or similar. The eighteen regions are actually platforms above the true surface of Mitral; the excavation probe cannot fly or hover (although it can rise and lower itself slightly on hydraulics), and moving off a platform causes the player to fall onto the surface and become marooned. However, in one area the player can find a garage containing a hovering vehicle that can be used to explore and attack security systems, though not to place drilling rigs. Development Driller was the first game to use the Freescape engine, which allowed the production of full three-dimensional environments using filled polygons in which the player could move around freely. It also gave the player the ability to look up and down, as well as rotate left and right, something which was rare amongst 3D games of the time. The same engine was used for Driller's sequel, Dark Side, as well as Total Eclipse, The Sphinx Jinx, Castle Master and Castle Master II: The Crypt. Reception The game received positive reviews from several sources. CRASH awarded the game 97%, stating that \\"with a stunning use of 3D graphics, very challenging gameplay, and the fascination of exploring a FreeScape world, Driller is one of the best games CRASH has seen.\\" The magazine's readers voted it the best overall game of 1987. Your Sinclair gave Driller 9/10 with reviewer Phil South stating \\"The game took a year to build, and it shows in the quality of the workmanship and the gameplay. I can tell that people are going to be sending in tips for this for months to come. Superb!\\" Zzap!64 awarded the game 96%. Amstrad Action reviewed the game in the January 1988 issue with an overall rating of 96% and earned the AA 'Mastergame' accolade. Is joint 3rd highest rated game in Amstrad Action's run.'Amstrad Action', issue 28, January 1988, pages 50-51 Orson Scott Card wrote in Compute! that \\"the lame science fiction story ... is a thinly veiled excuse for what's really a programmer's exercise in 3-D graphics. But once you stop expecting the story to make sense, this is a fun game, as you explore a strange world...a fascinating experience\\".

Her interest in natural history and traditional rural customs and crafts has spilled over into these chronicles of hedgerow life. She lived with her husband and children near Epping Forest in England. Merchandise Since the 1980s, the Brambly Hedge characters have appeared on merchandise ranging from china to chocolate, stationery to pewter miniatures. Companies such as Royal Doulton, Hantel, Crummles and Border Fine Arts have all produced collectible pieces licensed from Brambly Hedge. Adaptations All eight books have been adapted into stop motion television specials, produced by HIT Entertainment. The first season of specials titled Seasons was animated by Cosgrove Hall Films while the second season titled Classics was animated by the then-newly formed HOT Animation. \\"Winter Story\\" was first broadcast on Christmas Day 1996 on BBC1, while the specials made their U.S. debut on the Starz pay-cable network the following year.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 2, 2006. This is the first episode to have a parody title of the film Million Dollar Baby, with the second being \\"Million Dollar Maybe\\" in Season 21. It was poorly received by fans. Plot When it is announced that the commissioner of pro football Bud Armstrong wants to expand the league, Homer leads the charge to get the new franchise in Springfield. At first his family does not think he can do it, but Homer manages to put forth a surprisingly strong package for the Springfield Meltdowns and the new park, named the Duff Beer Krusty Burger Buzz Cola Costington's Department Store Kwik-E-Mart Stupid Flanders Park. The commissioner narrows down the choice of the two cities to either Springfield or Los Angeles. L.A. puts forth an anti-Springfield video hosted by Rob Reiner and features a song sung by celebrity impersonators that ends with them singing \\"Springfield Blows\\". All the owners decide that Springfield is the lesser of two evils (it does not hurt that the Rich Texan owns slums in Springfield and another owner snaps that she did not kill her husband and seize his team just to put a team in Los Angeles) and the Commissioner awards the new team to Springfield. The town gets \\"Meltmania\\" and \\"Downs syndrome\\", quickly builds Homer's new park, paints the town in the team colours (orange and purple) and changes all of the street names to football- related names (e.g. Two-Point Conversion Avenue, Off-Season Knee Surgery Blvd). On the day when Springfield is officially announced as the new team, Commissioner Armstrong gets confused by all of the new street names and gets lost. He stops for directions at the Simpsons' house and is greeted by Grampa Simpson, who welcomes him in. However, Grampa is watching a TV program about undercover burglars who act just as the Commissioner did (asking for a telephone and a bathroom and, sometimes, taking pictures of the children of the house - he was looking at one with Bart and Lisa when attacked), and sneaks up behind Armstrong and knocks him unconscious with a golf club. The rest of the family arrives home, disappointed that the commissioner did not show and is shocked to find him tied up in their living room. The commissioner furiously declares that neither he nor the League will ever return to Springfield, ending the Meltdowns' history before it began. The entire town then hates Grampa, and the expensive stadium has to be used for farmers' markets, with even his dentures refusing to smile at him. Grampa is depressed and decides to seek out a doctor called Dr. Egoyan who will help him commit suicide with a suicide booth called a \\"diePod\\". The doctor tells Grampa to reconsider, and Grampa decides that if anyone calls him in the next 24 hours, he will not go through with his plan. The call never comes and Grampa goes back to the clinic the next day. To make it a more peaceful experience they project in front of him, at his request, hippies being beaten up by police while music from the Glenn Miller Orchestra plays. Grampa comes very close to dying but Chief Wiggum ends the procedure just in time, telling the doctor that voters have overturned Springfield's assisted-suicide law. Grampa thinks he is dead and runs through the town, seeing \\"Hamburger Heaven\\" and a Charlie Chaplin impersonator. He soon learns that he is not dead, gets a new lease on life and decides to live without fear. Meanwhile, the city decides to turn the unused football stadium into an arena for bull fighting. Despite Lisa's protests, as they go against her vegetarianism, Grampa decides to become a matador. Grampa wins his first fight with a bull, but at home, Lisa tells Grampa that she wants him to stop hurting and killing animals. Grampa tells her that people are cheering him for his success, but Lisa tells him that she has always cheered for him until now. Grampa is not sure about that, but in the next fight he sees the bull that he is about to kill and decides to spare its life. He releases all the bulls, which immediately start running through the streets of Springfield, causing a great deal of destruction and injuring everyone. One bull takes the elevator up to the press box, and attacks the announcer, who is a parody of Spanish-language soccer announcer Andres Cantor. Lisa is proud of Grampa and the two reconcile in two Lawnchair Larry flight type patio chairs, but they both become in danger by two bulls flying with balloons. In the post-credits scene, a flashback shows that Abe was present at the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings. While he was only there to test out the microphone during preparation time, he names several individuals as members of the Communist Party before being escorted out of the room. Cultural references In the \\"Springfield Blows\\" music video, Jar Jar Binks, Michael Jackson, Keith Richards, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey are seen. The song \\"Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)\\" by John Lennon is featured when Grampa becomes a town pariah. When Grandpa decides to enlist medical help in an assisted suicide (via the \\"die-Pod\\"), he is given three options; 'instant death, slow-painful death & \\"Megadeath\\"', in reference to the Heavy Metal band Megadeth. The euthanasia machine, the \\"diePod\\" is named after the iPod and bears a physical resemblance to it. The scene where Grandpa seeks assisted suicide is also a reference to the scene in the film Soylent Green where the character played by Edward G. Robinson seeks a similar fate. During the montage showing Grampa's new lease on life, \\"Superman\\" by R.E.M. plays. Notes The original airing of the episode was followed by a teaser trailer for The Simpsons Movie. It featured a close-up of the famous \\"S\\" shield with the effect meant to be created that it is a trailer for the Superman movie that was to be released that summer, only to pan out to Homer wearing the shirt on his couch, then admitting \\"I don't know what to say.\\" The chalkboard gag has been used on Channel 4 for other episodes. Review SirLemming on toonzone says: \\"This one should've been axed as soon as \\"Grampa becomes a bullfighter\\" was suggested. It could've been much worse, but it was still pretty much a stinker, including one of the most tacked-on moral dilemmas of all time.\\"The Simpsons Season 17 in review References  External links  Category:The Simpsons (season 17) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about euthanasia ","title":"Million Dollar Abie"},{"id":"3905695","text":"Will Clarke (born August 13, 1970) is an American novelist who is the author of Lord Vishnu's Love Handles: A Spy Novel (sort of), The Worthy: A Ghost's Story, and The Neon Palm of Madame Melan√ßon.

Located just south of the city centre, on the westernmost tip of the Bod√∏ peninsula, it shares facilities with the military air force base Bod√∏ Main Air Station. The airport has a single concrete, runway which runs in a roughly east‚Äìwest direction. In addition to jet operations to major domestic destinations, the airport serves as a hub for regional airline flights to Helgeland, Lofoten and Vester√•len. History Postal flights to Bod√∏ started in 1921, and before 1940 Bod√∏ was served with sea planes from Wider√∏e. The first runway at Bod√∏ Airport was built during World War II by British troops, after Germany had invaded Norway. On 26 May 1940 three Royal Air Force Gloster Gladiators, led by Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull, landed and made the first airborne defence for the city. The area was swampland, and the first makeshift runway consisted of wooden planks floating on the water. Soon the German Luftwaffe seized control over the airport, and held it for the duration of the war, among other things upgrading the runway to concrete. Not much was done with the airport until after the Korean War started in 1950. The West were afraid of a Soviet attack on Western Europe, so a new military base was constructed at a new location south-west of the old one. Originally planned to be finished in 1951, the new airport did not become fully operational until 1956, though the civilian terminal opened in 1952. From then on fighter jets have been stationed at Bod√∏. In 1988, NATO injected vast amounts of money to enable the airfield to handle large air forces in the event of an emergency. The airport was used during the testing of Concorde in June 1975. In the early 1980s the current civilian terminal was discussed and planned. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance approved the project early in 1988. The construction started a few weeks after its approval and was completed in spring 1990. The terminal has 11 gates, three with jetways. Since its opening in 1990, the number of passengers increased from 820,000 to 1,700,000 in 2013. Air force base The Bod√∏ Main Air Station, situated adjacent to the airport, is the largest air station in Norway operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. This air station is the home of the 331st and the 332nd Squadrons equipped with General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons in addition to a detachment from the 330th Squadron of Westland Sea King helicopters. Airlines and destinations The airport acts as a hub for regional airports between Trondheim and Troms√∏, in addition to being served by more than ten daily return flights to Oslo‚ÄìGardermoen. Several international seasonal routes are also served.https://avinor.no/en/airport/bodo-airport/ Bod√∏ Airport main terminal The smaller General Aviation terminal at Bod√∏ Ground transport The airport is very near the city centre, about 1.5 km distance, and from the railway station 2.0 km. Travel to the airport can be done by local bus, by taxi, or by foot. There are also regional buses from the airport. Norwegian Aviation Museum The Norwegian Aviation Museum is located next to the airport in a propeller-shaped building. An aviation centre at the airport was approved by parliament on 31 March 1992, and opened 15 May 1994. The military part ‚Äì Luftfartsmuseet (the Aviation Museum) was opened in May 1995. The Norwegian Aviation Museum was formed on 1 January 1998, founded by the government, the local city council of Bod√∏ and county council of Nordland. The museum is a \\"national museum\\" and funded through the national budget. The museum exhibits several military aircraft including a Lockheed U-2, a Gloster Gladiator and a Supermarine Spitfire. There are also some civilian aircraft on display such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter, Junkers Ju 52/3m on floats, a Fokker F.28-1000 Fellowship. Accidents and incidents * Lockheed U-2 spy aircraft were stationed at Bod√∏ in 1958. On 1 May 1960, a U-2 piloted by Gary Powers was headed for Bod√∏ from Pakistan but was shot down, causing the U-2 Crisis of 1960. *On 4 December 2003, a Dornier 228 of Kato Airline operating as Flight 603 was struck by lightning, causing a fracture to the control rod that operated the elevator. The aircraft subsequently landed heavily just short of the runway at Bod√∏ and was written off. Both crew members sustained serious injuries while both passengers sustained slight injuries. * On 29 September 2004, an asylum-seeker armed with an axe attacked the pilot of a Kato Airline flight from Narvik, causing the aircraft, a Dornier 228, to go into a dive. The assailant was overpowered by passengers, including Odd Eriksen, later a member of the government (Minister of Commerce), and the aircraft made a safe landing at Bod√∏.

Robertson (1989:123) maintains a crime is nothing more than \\"an act that contravenes a law\\". Generally speaking, deviancy is criminalized when it is too disruptive and has proved uncontrollable through informal sanctions. Public order crime should be distinguished from political crime. In the former, although the identity of the \\"victim\\" may be indirect and sometimes diffuse, it is cumulatively the community that suffers, whereas in a political crime, the state perceives itself to be the victim and criminalizes the behaviour it considers threatening. Thus, public order crime includes consensual crime and victimless crime. It asserts the need to use the law to maintain order both in the legal and moral sense. Public order crime is now the preferred term by proponents as against the use of the word \\"victimless\\" based on the idea that there are secondary victims (family, friends, acquaintances, and society at large) that can be identified. For example, in cases where a criminal act subverts or undermines the commercial effectiveness of normative business practices, the negative consequences extend beyond those at whom the specific immediate harm was intended. Similarly, in environmental law, there are offences that do not have a direct, immediate and tangible victim, so crimes go largely unreported and unprosecuted because of the problem of lack of victim awareness. In short, there are no clear, unequivocal definitions of \\"consensus\\", \\"harm\\", \\"injury\\", \\"offender\\", and \\"victim\\". Such judgments are always informed by contestable, epistemological, moral, and political assumptions (de Haan, 1990: 154). A vice squad is a police division whose focus is stopping public-order crimes like gambling, narcotics, prostitution, and illegal sales of alcohol. England and Wales Note that under English and Welsh law, a \\"public order offence\\" is a different category of crime related to disorderly conduct and other breaches of the peace. See the following: Crimes without apparent victims In public order crimes, there are many instances of criminality where a person is accused because he/she has made a personal choice to engage in an activity of which society disapproves, e.g., private recreational drug use. Thus, there is continuing political debate on criminalization versus decriminalization, focusing on whether it is appropriate to use punishment to enforce the various public policies that regulate the nominated behaviours. After all, society could deal with unpopular behaviour without invoking criminal or other legal processes. Following the work of Schur (1965), the types of crime usually referred to include the sexually based offences of prostitution, paraphilia (i.e., sexual practices considered deviant), underage sex, and pornography; and the offences involving substance abuse which may or may not involve some element of public disorder or danger to the public as in driving while intoxicated. Since 1965, however, societal views have changed greatly, for example, prostitution, often considered a victimless crime, is classified by some countries as a form of exploitation of women‚Äîsuch views are held in Sweden, Norway and Iceland, where it is illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute), see Prostitution in Sweden. When deciding whether harm to innocent individuals should be prohibited, the moral and political beliefs held by those in power interact and inform the decisions to create or repeal crimes without apparent victims. These decisions change over time as moral standards change. For example, Margaret Sanger who founded the first birth control clinic in New York City was accused of distributing obscene material and violating public morals. Information about birth control is no longer considered obscene (see the U.S. case law examples). Within the context of a discussion (Feinberg: 1984) on whether governments should regulate public morals in the interest of the public good, Meier & Geis (1997) identify which social problems might be deemed appropriate for legal intervention and the extent to which the criminal law should enforce moral positions which may lack societal consensus. This reflects a more fundamental problem of legal consistency. People have the right to engage in some self- destructive activities. For all its carcinogenic qualities, tobacco is not a prohibited substance. Similarly, the excessive consumption of alcohol can have severe physical consequences, but it is not a crime to consume it. This is matched in gambling. The state and its institutions often rely on lotteries, raffles, and other legal forms of gambling for operating funds, whether directly or indirectly through the taxation of profits from casinos and other licensed outlets. Qualitatively, there is nothing to distinguish the forms of gambling deemed illegal. A side effect of turning too many people into criminals is that the concept of crime becomes blurred and genuine criminality becomes less unacceptable. If the key distinction between real crime and moral regulation is not made clearly, as more consensual activities become crimes, ordinary citizens are criminalized for tax-evasion, illegal downloading, and other voluntary rule-breaking. A further perceptual problem emerges when laws remain in force but are obviously not enforced, i.e. the police reflect the consensus view that the activity should not be a crime. Alternatively, if the activities prohibited are consensual and committed in private, this offers incentives to the organizers to offer bribes in exchange for diverting enforcement resources or to overlooking discovered activity, thereby encouraging political and police corruption. Thus, any deterrent message that the state might wish to send is distorted or lost. More generally, political parties find it easier to talk dismissively about crimes if they are classified as victimless because their abolition or amendment looks to have fewer economic and political costs, i.e., the use of the word \\"victimless\\" implies that there are no injuries caused by these crimes (Robertson 1989:125) and, if that is true, then there is no need to create or retain the criminal offences. This may reflect a limited form of reality that, in the so-called \\"victimless crimes\\", there are no immediate victims to make police reports and those who engage in the given behaviour regard the law as inappropriate, not themselves. This has two consequences: *Because these crimes often take place in private, comprehensive law enforcement (often including entrapment and the use of agent provocateurs) would consume an enormous amount of resources. It is therefore convenient for the law enforcement agencies to classify a crime as victimless because that is used as a justification for devoting fewer resources as against crimes where there are \\"real\\" victims to protect; and *These crimes usually involve something desirable where large profits can be made, e.g., drugs or sex. The hidden crime factor Because most of these crimes take place in private or with some degree of secrecy, it is difficult to establish the true extent of the crime. The \\"victims\\" are not going to report it and arrest statistics are unreliable indicators of prevalence, often varying in line with local political pressure to \\"do something\\" about a local problem rather than reflecting the true incidence of criminal activity. In addition to the issue of police resources and commitment, many aspects of these activities are controlled by organized crime and are therefore more likely to remain hidden. These factors are used to argue for decriminalization. Low or falling arrest statistics are used to assert that the incidence of the relevant crimes is low or now under control. Alternatively, keeping some of these \\"vices\\" as crimes simply keeps organized crime in business. Decriminalization of public order crimes Maguire and Radosh (1999: 146/7) accept that the public order crimes that cause the most controversy are directly related to the current perceptions of morality. To assert that the shades of behaviour represented by such \\"crimes\\" should be retained or decriminalized ignores the range of arguments that can be mustered on both sides, but the most fundamental question remains whether the government has the right to enforce laws prohibiting private behaviour. =Arguments in favor of decriminalization= Those who favor decriminalization or legalization contend that government should be concerned with matters affecting the common good, and not seek to regulate morality at an individual level. Indeed, the fact that the majority ignore many of the laws, say on drug-taking, in countries founded on democratic principles should encourage the governments elected by those majorities to repeal the laws. Failure to do so simply undermines respect for all laws, including those laws that should, and, indeed, must be followed. Indeed, when considering the range of activities prohibited, the practical policing of all these crimes would require the creation of a police state intruding into every aspect of the peoples' lives, no matter how private. It is unlikely that this application of power would be accepted even if history showed such high-profile enforcement to be effective. Prohibition did not prevent the consumption of alcohol, and the present War on Drugs is expensive and ineffective. Those who favor decriminalization also point to experience in those countries which permit activities such as recreational drug use. There is clear evidence of lower levels of substance abuse and disruptive behavior. #The presence of public order crimes encourages a climate of general disrespect for the law. Many individuals choose to violate public order laws, because they are easily violable, and there is no victim to complain. This encourages disrespect for the law, including disrespect for laws involving crimes with victims. #To criminalize behavior that harms no other or society violates individual freedom and the human/natural rights of the individual. The right of the individual to do what they will, so long as they harm no other, or society as a whole, is a generally accepted principle within free and democratic societies;John Stuart Mill, On Liberty, for a discussion of the Harm Principle criminalization of acts that others feel are immoral, but are not clearly proven to be harmful, is generally violative of that principle; although exceptions may‚Äîand do‚Äîapply. (For example, the simple possession of child pornography or engaging in animal cruelty is criminal, in most civilized nations; however, there is no direct victim (except the animal, whose rights are not cognizable by law); the reason for its criminalization is the \\"bad tendency\\" of these acts; persons who derive pleasure from acts such as these often have depraved desires‚Äîit can be inferred that people who abuse animals, rarely stop there‚Äîand that people who possess child pornography will seek more than just mere depictions.) There are questions of the victimlessness of such supposed \\"exception\\" crimes as well as criticisms of the validity of assuming \\"bad tendencies\\" though. One example of criticism of the idea of criminalizing cruelty to animals out of a bad tendency in the people who do it instead of animal suffering is that research on the ability of animals to suffer by studies of animal brains is often used to determine what animals should be covered by laws against cruelty to animals, as shown in controversies about extending such laws to fish and invertebrates in which animal brain studies (not forensic psychiatry on humans) are the main cited arguments both for and against criminalization. It is also pointed out that computer games with \\"cruelty\\" to virtual mammals are legal in most Western countries while cruelty to real mammals is not, again showing that it is inner animal suffering and not outer body language that is relevant regardless of whether or not animals are formally classified as victims in courts. The notion of cruelty to animals as a predictor of violence to other humans is also criticized for lacking consistency with the evolutionary notion of empathy being gradually extended from close relatives to more distant relatives according to which cruelty to other humans should predict cruelty to animals but not the other way, explaining the appearance of cruelty to animals being a risk factor for violence to humans as a result of criminal investigation spending more resources investigating people known to abuse animals for human violence while people with no history of animal abuse or animal neglect more easily get away with violence to other humans due to being less investigated. In the case of child pornography depicting real children (not cartoons), victimlessness is questioned as circulation of pornographic images of people taken when they were too young to consent to it may injure their personal integrity. In the case of cartoons it is pointed out that the same psychiatrists who argued for criminalization (which in most countries where it is present happened later than criminalization of pornography with real children suggesting that it was not for the same reasons) have used the same arguments to acquit or strongly reduce sentences for statutory rape in cases where they deemed the victim to \\"look older\\", which critics cite as an example of it being counterproductive to protecting children, arguing that a societal transition from visual age guessing to ID checking would reduce statutory rape. There are other arguments than depravity to ban pornographic cartoons depicting minors however, including curtailment of profit from such cartoons which explains why such laws in some European countries have exceptions for cases when the creator and the possessor are the same person in which no transaction is involved. It is also argued that passive marijuana smoking de facto constitutes victimization in some cases of drug use. More generally it is argued that civilized punishment should be based on deterrence, while basing punishment on assumptions of depravity leads to inhumane and uncivilized punishment as the assumption that some people are inherently bad leads to an appearance of persecution being \\"necessary\\". It is also argued that since higher priorities of criminal investigation of people considered depraved can find statistical correlations by higher percentages of criminals in profiled groups being caught compared to non-profiled groups no matter if there is a link or not as a self-fulfilling prophecy, preventing it from being self-correcting and making it possible for depravity arguments to lead to anyone being classified as depraved and, as a result, a general loss of freedom. It is therefore argued that depravity arguments should be categorically avoided, as any \\"exception\\" would be a mobile goal post.\\"Rational Choice and Situational Crime Prevention: Theoretical Foundations\\" Graeme Newman, Ronald V. Clarke 2016\\"Criminal Justice\\" Anthea Hucklesby, Azrini Wahidin 2013 #The cost of enforcing public order crimes is too high to individual and societal freedom, and will inevitably result in coercion, force, brutality, usurpation of the democratic process, the development of a carceral state, and finally, tyranny. Due to public order crimes not having a victim, someone aside from a victim has to be used to report public order crimes, and someone other than the sovereign people itself has to be delegated to enforce the public order laws (for examples of direct popular enforcement of laws, see hue and cry, posse comitatus, and the last vestige of democratic law enforcement today, the jury). This results in the development of an apparatus of coercion, a class of \\"law enforcers\\" within society, but separate from society, in that they are tasked with enforcing laws upon the people, rather than the people enforcing their own law. This inevitably results in violations of individual freedom, as this class of \\"law enforcers\\" seeks more and more power, and turns to more and more coercive means. #Public order crimes often pertain to behavior engaged in especially by discernible classes of individuals within society (racial minorities, women, youth, poor people), and result in the criminalization or stigmatization of those classes, as well as resentment from those classes against the laws, against the government, or against society. #Public order crimes will end up being selectively prosecuted, since it is not possible to prosecute them all. This creates or reinforces class, gender, or race based criminalization or stigmatization. It also is a very powerful tool for political persecution and suppression of dissent (see Selective enforcement). It produces a situation in which otherwise upstanding citizens are committing \\"crimes\\" but in the absence of mens rea (guilty mind) and without even being aware of the fact that their behavior is or was illegal until it becomes convenient to the state to prosecute them for it. # The natural variation in internal moral compass, which often turns out to be beneficial to society, or to stem from variations of understanding which will always be with us to some degree, leads to individuals committing \\"crimes\\" in the absence of mens rea. Individuals of all political stripes and background who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of the law are vulnerable to accidentally committing crimes and suffering punishment when they were not aware that the behavior was even considered problematic. For instance individuals who violate building or zoning codes on their own property may be stuck with large expenses, life disruptions, or fines unexpectedly. #Public enforcement of morality will inevitably lead to individuals with underdeveloped moral compasses of their own, instead resulting in external restraint substituting for internal restraint, and, thus, greater immorality, deviance, and societal decadence. Or, they may give up on their internal compass and turn to a more Machiavellian approach if they are punished for following it. =Arguments against decriminalization= Those who oppose decriminalization believe that the morality of individuals collectively affects the good of the society and, without enforcement, the society will be damaged and lead to decadence. They believe that law shapes morality and builds a national character. If laws are not enforced, that is not the fault of the law. If people knew that they were likely to be arrested, they would modify their behavior. That current laws criminalizing theft do not deter thieves is not an argument for decriminalizing theft (although theft is not in any way a victimless crime). Rather it is an argument in favor of devoting more resources into enforcement so that there is greater certainty of arrest and punishment. Thus, in public order crimes, it is simply a lack of priority in current enforcement strategies that encourages such widespread public disobedience which, in all likelihood, would increase if the behavior was to be decriminalized. Specific examples Meier and Geis (1997) contrast the view that prostitution and drug offenses are crimes without victims, with the view that the participants involved are victims without crimes. The use of the term \\"public order crime\\" grew out of the research to test the hypothesis underlying the term \\"victimless crime\\". So-called victimless crimes or crimes without victims were tested to determine whether a case could be argued that the behaviour produced harmful consequences for innocent people (p19) recognising that there was substantial disagreement both about the degree of culpability inherent in the behaviour and the proper role for the law. Consequently, the effectiveness and scope of the law has proved limited, both creating and solving problems. The following are examples of the research findings used to construct arguments that there are victims. It is accepted that there are other arguments that many consider equally convincing (as an example). =Prostitution= :For a full discussion from a criminology perspective, see Prostitution law =Drugs= The use of drugs for religious and recreational purposes is historically verified among a wide range of cultures. In more modern times, Inciardi (1992: 1‚Äì17) reports that the use of opium, cocaine, and, later, morphine were common ingredients of patent medicines, and \\"opium dens\\" were not uncommon in the larger urban areas. Extracts from the coca leaf were included in the original Coca-Cola and, in 1900, heroin was promoted as a cough medication and a treatment for lung diseases. But problems flowing from addiction led many to perceive the drug element of medications to be morally destructive. In the United States, the Supreme Court decisions of Webb et al. v U.S. 249 U.S. 96 (1919) and U.S. v Behrman 258 U.S. 280 (1922) drove the use of narcotics underground and consolidated their criminal status. In the terms adopted by Schur (1965), drug dealing is now victimless because neither the buyer nor the seller is likely to report it. The consumption of some drugs can damage the health of users causing indirect societal cost due to increased hospitalizations and, in some cases, cause death through overdose because substitution or poor quality, although this potential for harm may be operationally indistinct from the potentials for harm associated with other noncriminal behaviors, such as driving a car while tired or over-consumption of healthy foods. Some argue that if drugs were available legally, they would be less harmful (see the drug policy of the Netherlands). When drugs are illegal, the price is higher, and maintaining the habit takes the money that would otherwise be spent on food, shelter, and clothing. The resultant neglect is a contributory factor to the addict's physical deterioration. In Australia, Walker (1991) finds a strong link between substance abuse and crime. In general, making drugs illegal results in an exponential increase in their price so that addicts must indulge in theft, robbery, and burglary to support their habits. Those people who experience those crimes are indirect victims of the drug sale. The need to fund addiction also drives some into distribution where they are more prone to violent attack and murder. These findings are matched elsewhere. Meier and Geis (1997) confirm that drug dealing is an area where victims are third parties who experience harm only indirectly through, say, losses from drug- related crime, and the costs of enforcing drug laws and of treating addiction, and the public health costs for treating illness and disease consequent on the addiction, e.g., HIV infection through using the same needles. In Australia, for example, the National Campaign against Drug Abuse (see Collins & Lapsley 1991) gives a figure of just over $1.2 billion for total costs of the abuse of illicit drugs in Australia in 1988, including treatment of drug-related illness, accidents resulting from drug use/misuse, loss of productivity due to absenteeism, premature death, property crime and damage, and excluding justice system costs. Conklin (1997: 100) reports the cost of illegal drug use in the U.S. in 1989 at $60 billion a year, a 20% increase over the estimate in 1985. The rise in cost to the state can only be met out of tax revenue, but the burden is not shared equally. Income actually spent on drugs is displaced from purchases that would otherwise have generated sales tax and income tax revenue. Similarly, the substantial profits made by the dealers is not taxed. Thus, the citizens who declare income for tax purposes must pay more to offset the cost of non-capture of drug revenue in their society. As with prostitution, crime related to drug dealing also affects the amenity of a neighbourhood, destroying property values and causing the flight of the middle class to the \\"safer\\" suburbs. If the police do intervene, they may alienate law-abiding community members who are stopped and questioned, and only displace the drug dealing indoors, thus making it more resistant to police interventions. Police may also use their power to extract rents from the drug selling community. Further, Sampson (2002) comments that because intensive police enforcement is by its very nature temporary, the impact is often only short-term and dependent on the resiliency of the market and the buyers which has been shown to be strong. Some officers have argued that intensive enforcement shows the community that the police care about the problem; however, some of the unintended effects may, in fact, have the opposite result. For a more general exposition, see arguments for and against drug prohibition.

It is also the present name of a nearby modern village, known up to the early 20th century as Pavlitsa (Œ†Œ±œçŒªŒπœÑœÉŒ±). In modern geography it is located in southeastern Elis. It is situated on an elevated rocky site, among some of the highest mountains in the Peloponnese, the most conspicuous being Mt Cotylium and Mt Elaeum; the identification of the latter is uncertain. Name The name Phigalia was more ancient than that of Phialia, but the original name had again come into use in the time of Pausanias.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.39.2 The city was said to have derived its more ancient name to from Phigalus, a son of Lycaon, its legendary original founder, and its later name from Phialus, a son of Lycaon, its second founder.Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, s.v. History In 659 BC Phigalia was taken by the Lacedaemonians, but soon after recovered its independence by the help of the Oresthasians, who, according to an oracle, perished fighting against the Lacedaemonians.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.39.4-5. In 375 BC, Phigalia was rent asunder by hostile factions; and the supporters of the Lacedaemonian party, being expelled from the city, took possession of a fortress in the neighbourhood named Heraea, from which they made excursions against Phigalia.Diod. 15.40. During the struggle between the Achaean and Aetolian leagues in 221 BC it was held by Dorimachus, who left it on the approach of Philip V of Macedon. In common with the other cities of Arcadia, it appears in Strabo to have fallen into utter decay under Roman rule. Situation and remains Phigalia was surrounded by mountains, of which Pausanias mentions two by name, Cotylium or Cotilium (œÑ·Ω∏ ŒöœâœÑŒØŒªŒπŒøŒΩ) and Elaeum (œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºòŒªŒ¨œäŒøŒº), the former to the left of the city, at the distance of 30 stadia, and the latter to the right at the distance of 30 stadia. As Cotilium lies to the northeast of Phigalia, and Pausanias in this description seems to have looked towards the east, Mt. Elaeum should probably be placed on the opposite side of Phigalia, and consequently to the south of the Neda, in which case it would correspond to the lofty mountain of K√∫vela. Mt. Elaeum contained a cavern sacred to the Black Demeter, situated in a grove of oaks. Of the position of Mt. Cotilium there is no doubt. On it was situated the temple of Apollo Epicurius, which was built in the Peloponnesian War by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon at Athens. It was erected by the Phigaleans in consequence of the relief afforded by Apollo during the plague in the Peloponnesian War, whence he received the surname of Epicurius. The temple stood in a place called Bassae, and according to Pausanias excelled all the temples of Peloponnesus, except that of Athena Alea at Tegea, in the beauty of the stone and the accuracy of its masonry. He particularly mentions that the roof was of stone as well as the rest of the building.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.41.7-8. This temple still remains almost entire, and is next to the Theseum at Athens the best preserved of the temples of Greece. It stands in a glen (whence the name Œí·æ∂œÉœÉŒ±Œπ, Doric for ŒíŒÆœÉœÉŒ∑, Œí·øÜœÉœÉŒ±Œπ) near the summit of Mt. Cotilium, in the midst of a wilderness of rocks, studded with old knotty oaks. Nineteenth-century British scholar William Mure who visited the site wrote that ‚Äúthere is certainly no remnant of the architectural splendour of Greece more calculated to fascinate the imagination than this temple; whether by its own size and beauty, by the contrast it offers to the wild desolation of the surrounding scenery, or the extent and variety of the prospect from its site.‚ÄùWilliam Mure, Journal of a Tour in Greece and the Ionian Islands (1842, Edinburgh), vol. ii. p. 270. A spring rises about ten minutes walk southwest of the temple, and soon afterwards loses itself in the ground, as Pausanias has described. North of the temple was the highest summit of the mountain, which one reaches in ten minutes' time by a broad road constructed by the Greeks. This summit was called Cotilum (ŒöœéœÑŒπŒªŒøŒΩ), whence the whole mountain derived the name of Cotilian; here was a sanctuary of Aphrodite, of which there are still some traces. The grandeur of the ruins of the temple have given to the whole of the surrounding district the name of the Columns (œÉœÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ œÉœÑœçŒªŒøœÖœÇ or Œ∫ŒøŒªœåŒΩŒΩŒ±ŒπœÇ). The temple is at least two and a half hours walk from the ruins of the city, and consequently more than the 40 stadia, which Pausanias mentions as the distance from Phigalia to Cotilium; but this distance perhaps applies to the nearest part of the mountain from the city. Several curious cults were preserved near Phigalia, including that of the fishtailed goddess Eurynome and the Black Demeter with a horse's head, whose image was renewed by Onatas. Notices of it in Greek history are rare and scanty. Though its existing ruins and the description of Pausanias, who describes it as situated upon a lofty and precipitous hill, the greater part of the walls being built upon the rocks, show it to have been a place of considerable strength and importance, no autonomous coins of Phigalia are known. Nothing remained above ground of the temples of Artemis or Dionysus and the numerous statues and other works of art which existed at the time of Pausanias' visit, about AD 170. A great part of the city wall, built in fine Hellenic masonry, partly polygonal masonry and partly isodomic ashlar, and a large square central fortress with a circular projecting tower, are the only remains now traceable, at least without the aid of excavation. The walls, once nearly in circuit, are strongly placed on rocks, which slope down to the little river Neda. The rock, upon which the city stood, slopes down towards the Neda; on the western side it is bounded by a ravine and on the eastern by the torrent Lymax, which flows into the Neda. The walls are of the usual thickness, faced with masonry of the second order, and filled in the middle with rubble. On the summit of the acropolis within the walls are the remains of a detached citadel, in length, containing a round tower at the extremity, measuring in the interior diameter. In ancient times a temple of Artemis Soteira stood on the summit of the acropolis. On the slope of the mountain lay the gymnasium and the temple of Dionysus Acratophorus; and on the ground below, where the village of upper Figaleia stands, was the agora, adorned with a statue of the pancratiast Arrachion, who lost his life in the Olympic games, and with the sepulchre of the Oresthasians, who perished to restore the Phigaleans to their native city.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.39.5-6, 8.40.1. Upon a rock, difficult of access, near the union of the Lymax and the Neda, was a temple of Eurynome, supposed to be a surname of Artemis, which was opened only once a year. In the same neighbourhood, and at the distance of 12 stadia from the city, were some warm baths, traces of which are visible at the village of Trag√≥i, but the waters have long ceased to flow.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.41.4 et seq.

Randazzo () is a town and comune in the Metropolitan City of Catania, Sicily, southern Italy. It is situated at the northern foot of Mount Etna, c. northwest of Catania. It is the nearest town to the summit of Etna, and is one of the points from which the ascent may be made. Randazzo History In the 13th century the town had its own army, which fought in favor of the king against the rebels. In 1210 King Frederick II of Hohenstaufen and his young wife Constance of Aragon sheltered at Randazzo to escape the terrible plague which raged in Palermo. Randazzo became one of the most densely populated towns in the island, after Palermo and Messina. The town was also divided into three main districts: the Greeks lived in St. Nicola's quarter, the Latins in St. Mary's and the Lombards in St. Martin's. Street in Randazzo Randazzo was the scene of important action during the latter phases of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, during World War II. Nazi forces were driven from the island by a combined force of British and American troops, which also contained Canadian troops who were fighting under British command. In the course of their retreat the Nazis attempted to hold the northeastern corner of Sicily in the hopes that they would eventually be able to retake the entire island. The Nazis had to abandon this plan when the British 30th Corps forced their way into Adrano while at the same time the British 13th Corps battled the Nazis in the nearby town of Randazzo. Once Adrano and Randazzo fell to the British, the Nazis decided they had no choice but to retire to Messina and use it to evacuate the rest of their forces from Sicily.Bitter Victory: The Battle for Sicily, 1943 by Carlo D'Este pg. 508-509 Santa Maria Randazzo Sicily Italy taken in April 2013 taken from via Perciabosco Main sights * Church of Santa Maria.

After a fusion with the town of Dessau it became eponym of the newly founded town of Dessau-Ro√ülauStBA: √Ñnderungen bei den Gemeinden Deutschlands, siehe 2007 and a quarter of it. Rosslau is situated on the right bank of the Elbe, here crossed by two railway bridges, 3 mi. by rail N. of Dessau and 35 mi. S.E. of Magdeburg. It has a ducal residence, an old castle, a handsome parish church, and manufactures of machinery, paper, sealing-wax, wire goods, sugar, bricks and chemicals. Rosslau became a town in 1603. Town merger On 1 July 2007 the town Rosslau (Elbe) was consolidated with the town Dessau. Together they are named Dessau-Ro√ülau. The mayor of the new town is Klemens Koschig, who was elected on 22 April 2007. History The town ‚ÄúRozelowe‚Äú was first documented in 1215. In 1359 ‚ÄúDat borchlen zu Rozlau‚Äù was mentioned. The name is of Dutch heritage and suggests the foundation and the settlement of Rosslau by inhabitants of the Dutch town Reuzel in North Brabant. The construction of the bridge over the Elbe River occurred in 1583 and just 20 years later the town was chartered and received its right to hold markets. During the Thirty Years' War the bridge was a scene of a battle. A few years later, in 1631, the bridge was destroyed. Six years after that, imperial soldiers burned down the town; in 1717 the town was in flames again. In 1740 the town hall and castle were built. From 1765-1767 Rosslau was a point of origin for colonial crusades of the Russian Tsarina Catherine the Great, a princess of the principality of Anhalt-Zerbst. In 1806 fleeing Prussians set the Elbe-bridge on fire again. From 1836-1838 Henry, Duke of Anhalt-K√∂then prompted the renovation of the deteriorating medieval castle in a gothic and romantic fashion. In the following years the connection to the network of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company, the foundation of fabrics, newspapers and shipyards took place. In 1907 the tramline between Dessau and Rosslau was put into operation. In fall 1933 the National Socialist government of Anhalt setup one of the early concentration camps in the former Volkshaus in the Hauptstra√üe 51 in which predominantly members of the Communist Party (KPD) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) were detained and deviled. In summer 1934 the concentration camp was closed. The remaining inmates were transferred to the concentration camp in Lichtenburg. Aiding the town of Dessau in becoming the capital of the district, the town Rosslau (Elbe) became suburbanised into Dessau from 1 April 1935 to 1 April 1946 which gave the town the required number of 100,000 inhabitants. In 1952 the district of Rosslau was built out of the eastern part of the district of Zerbst. This gave Rosslau the status of a country town, which it hold until 30 Juny 1994, before it became part of the Anhalt-Zerbst district. Until 1991 Rosslau was the base of the 7th Guards Tank Division of the Soviet forces in Germany. The Elbe-flood from 2002 exceeded the Elbe-flood from 1845. Sights The moated castle of Rosslau is very popular location for Open-Air Events and Stage Plays. The annual This is Ska Festival takes part in the castle since 1997. There's also a Country Festival offering Liveacts, Linedance and a Western Casino. The Knight Dinner is a popular event too. The European village was built after an architectural competition from 1993 to 1996. Architect's offices from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Hungary, Finland and France created the plans and a few conspicuous buildings were built. Other places to see are the \\"√ñhlm√ºhle\\" (Oil Mill) and St. Mary's City Church. Traffic The \\"Bundesstrassen\\" B184 and B187 go through Rosslau. Rosslau also has a main train station with connections to Dessau, Magdeburg, Berlin, Halle, Bitterfeld and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.

She first appeared in Power Pack #1 and was created by Louise Simonson and June Brigman. Publication history Katie Power debuted as Energizer in Power Pack #1 (cover date August 1984), and used this superhero alter-ego between issues 1 and 25, then (after a power-swap) continued to star under the name Starstreak between issues 25 and 52, after which she took the name Counterweight for issues 52 to 62 (changing her costume in issue 47), before returning to her original codename (and costume) as Energizer in the Power Pack Holiday Special and subsequent 4-issue Power Pack miniseries published in 2000 ‚Äì in the latter, she wore a different costume not previously seen. Katie did not resurface in the Marvel Universe until her appearance as a potential candidate for the Great Lakes Avengers in issue #2 of the GLA: MISASSEMBLED miniseries, where she is seen wearing her Power Pack costume from the Marvel Adventures range of Power Pack titles while operating as a solo superhero, in Loners #4, she was purportedly the recipient of a phone call from her sister Julie ‚Äì though Katie was not seen during this conversation and in Fantastic Four #574, where she was among the guests for Franklin Richards' birthday party. The character has since made appearances in several of Marvel's 'alternate continuity' imprints, most notably as a recurring cast member in several Marvel Adventures and MC2 titles (see bibliography at foot of page). Fictional character biography Katie Power was born in Richmond, Virginia. Her full name is given as \\"Kate (Katie) Margret Power\\" in Power Pack #47. The youngest of the four Power siblings, she was only 5 years old when she was given her powers by Aelfyre Whitemane, a dying Kymellian noble.Power Pack #1 Katie and her siblings then form the superhero team Power Pack. When she first receives her powers, Katie is highly suggestible. She is frequently goaded into using her powers by her siblings and looks to them for instructions. Consequently, she is responsible for significant damage to both buildings and some of Power Pack's enemies. Her eldest brother, unofficial team leader Alex, bullies her to such an extent that she compares him to Power Pack's archenemy, Queen Maraud.Power Pack #25 At one point, Julie observes that Katie is bullied into using her powers even when she's scared or thinks it's wrong to hurt others, and that she later regrets the damage she does.Power Pack #23 For instance, during the team's first encounter with Kurse during Secret Wars II, Katie realizes that Kurse is completely disoriented and hesitates when she is asked to blast him. After she is finally bullied into destroying a building and crushing Kurse, she immediately worries that she has killed him.Power Pack #18 Katie grows into a much more assertive and sensitive individual. When she witnesses the physical damage she had done to Jakal and Kurse, she begins to realize the magnitude of her actions. In the Snark Wars, she saves her siblings' lives, loses her energy powers and gains the flight/acceleration abilities formerly held by her sister Julie. Katie emerges as a stronger character, ignores her siblings when they try to get her to do things she doesn't agree with, and refuses to use her powers to seriously harm people. By issue #36, Alex observes that Katie is no longer a \\"dumb little kid\\".Power Pack #36 Katie Power (as Starstreak) fights Pestilence in the Fall of the Mutants crossover. After the Snark Wars, whenever possible, Katie attempts to act as a rescuer. During The Fall of the Mutants, Katie even tries to save Pestilence, in spite of the fact that the villain had just made her ill.Power Pack #35X-Factor #25 In spite of her youth, Katie has been a key member of Power Pack, and has played major roles in most of the team's battles. In numerous instances, she has rescued the entire team, uncovered crucial information and provided critical support in missions. When the Pack encountered Master Mold, for instance, Katie saved Franklin Richards' life by flying right under the giant robot's foot. In a separate incident, Power Pack was captured by evil mutants called the Morlocks, and only Katie escaped. She managed to save her siblings with the help of some X-Men, and was given honorary status by the team.Uncanny X-Men #195 In another memorable incident, she found herself lost in a blinding snowstorm in Manhattan, where she encountered a seriously injured and disoriented Wolverine. She was able to assist him in his flight from Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers until he healed enough to neutralize his enemies.Uncanny X-Men #205 Katie also had another solo adventure at some point in which she was brought into conflict with the agents of A.I.M., whom she defeated while being 'scouted' as a potential recruit for the Great Lakes Avengers, but not being familiar with her would-be recruiter, Doorman (who was attempting to coerce her into accompanying him after approaching her in the dead of night), she refused membership.GLA: Misassembled #2 Katie is highly intelligent; at five she was literate and able to write fluently enough to compose a \\"War Journal\\", copying the Punisher.Strange Tales (vol. 2) #13‚Äì14 She is later depicted as a genius who has skipped several grades of school and can program supercomputers.Power Pack (vol. 2) #1 In the original series, Katie had a close, sibling-like relationship with the fifth Power Pack member, Franklin Richards. The two did not become friends immediately; during Franklin's first encounter with Power Pack, Katie disliked him on sight. She was jealous of the attention he received from the other members of the Pack, and perceived him as usurping her role as the \\"littlest superhero\\" and the team baby. However, after Franklin showed his courage in battle with Jakal, despite his lack of any \\"active\\" powers to defend himself, Katie's opinion of him improved considerably.Power Pack #16‚Äì17 Their relationship after their initial adventure was much more amicable, though still flavored with a pseudo-sibling rivalry. Franklin's superhero codename, \\"Tattletale\\", was taken at Katie's suggestion. Katie (along with her brothers Jack and Alex) was among the guests invited at Franklin's birthday party.Fantastic Four #574 Katie, along with Jack and Julie, were summoned by her brother Alex to help the Future Foundation deal against the threat of Sol's Anvil.FF #15 Powers and abilities Katie began her superhero career as Energizer. She could disintegrate any kind of matter, including water and air molecules, store the energy and expel it in balls of explosive energy. Katie's Energizer power was highly destructive, potentially lethal, and in various issues, was able to destroy buildings and bring down supervillains such as Kurse. Katie initially had little control over her power, and tended to use it when she was frightened or angry, but as the series progressed, she gained control over her abilities. During the Snark Wars, Katie voluntarily relinquished her energy powers to the Snark prince Jakal. Her siblings had already had their abilities forcibly taken from them by Jakal. In the ensuing battle, the powers reverted to the Power siblings one by one and Katie ended up with Julie's flight powers. While she held Julie's flight powers, Katie was known as Starstreak. She was able to fly quickly, leaving a stream of rainbow light in her wake. While Katie as Starstreak was never able to break the sound barrier as her sister Julie supposedly did, she did refine the power by developing hovering abilities.Power Pack #25‚Äì52 After Queen Mother Maraud briefly gained the abilities of Power Pack in Power Pack #52, Katie ended up with the gravity powers previously held by her brothers Alex and Jack. She took the same code name Jack had used, Counterweight. She was able to float, \\"gravitize\\" to any surface, and cancel the gravity of any object she touched. She was also able to increase her own gravity to deliver \\"Super-G\\" powerful punches and make herself extremely heavy.Power Pack #52‚Äì61 During Power Pack's mission in the Technocrat's space station, Katie regained her original energy powers.Power Pack Holiday Special She continues to use these abilities under her original name of Energizer.Power Pack (vol. 2) #1‚Äì4 Along with her siblings, Katie possessed Kymellian healing powers. Usually, she was required to work with her siblings to generate and use this ability; however, she occasionally accessed it on her own.Power Pack #24 Katie and her siblings also owned a Kymellian smartship called Friday. The ship acted as an unofficial team advisor and accompanied the Pack on several missions. Throughout her affiliation with Power Pack, Katie wears a costume of unstable molecules created by Friday. The costume exists in an extra-dimensional space known as \\"Elsewhere\\" until summoned by voice command (the wearer would say the words \\"costume on!\\"). The costume also houses a communicator which is used to communicate with Friday, and was later modified to include a mask.Power Pack (Vol.2) As with all the team's costumes, the pockets of the costume can be used as an access point to Elsewhere itself, where the cartoon-like creatures known simply as \\"The Tailors\\" reside in a colorful wonderland of talking dinosaurs, enchanted forests, mad monarchs, surreal architecture and malleable physical laws.Power Pack #47 Katie was the only member of Power Pack to actually visit Elsewhere; while there, she learned how to modify the team's costumes. Katie also owned a gold Kymellian coin, which was a present from her \\"honorary godfather\\", Lord Byrel. Both the Pack's enemies and allies were able to use the coin as a tracking device to locate the team.Power Pack #15‚Äì16 Other versions =Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius= In the out-of- continuity humor series Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius, Katie Power appears as a classmate of Franklin who comes to visit him at the Baxter Building. Though Katie seems to have a crush on Franklin, she is initially spurned by him in stereotypical young boy fashion. However, Franklin seems to reciprocate the crush when he realizes that Katie has a talent for mischief and mayhem similar to his own. In the Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius- School's Out story \\"Picnic Panic\\", she accidentally reveals her superpowers to Franklin while saving him from giant ants, which he describes as \\"so cool!\\"Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius and Franklin Richards: Son of a Genius-School's Out! =MC2= A grown up Katie, called Kate, appeared in the Avengers Next limited series.

This version of Energizer demonstrates greater control over her powers, is able to disintegrate a foot-thick wall of titanium, and launch focused energy bolts from her fingertips. This incarnation's Katie also claims Franklin was the first boy she kissed.Avengers and Power Pack Assemble! miniseries =Marvel Zombies vs Army of Darkness= Katie is seen alongside the rest of Power Pack as zombies who kill and consume several innocent bystanders before coming into conflict with Nextwave, whom Power Pack then murder several seconds later.Marvel Zombies vs Army of Darkness #3 References  External links  * Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson Category:Child superheroes Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional characters from Virginia Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing Category:Marvel Comics child superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes Category:Marvel Comics mutates Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Katie Power"},{"id":"3905811","text":"Anthony Mark Stuart (born 2 January 1970, in Newcastle, New South Wales) is a former Australian, New South Wales, and Canberran cricketer.

The Maori call it \\"Tutukiwi\\". The nominate race C. a. aucklandica (Auckland snipe) is found on the Auckland Islands (excluding the main island). Other subspecies include C. a. meinertzhagenae (Antipodes snipe) from the Antipodes Islands, and C. a. perseverance (Campbell snipe) from Campbell Island. The former subspecies from the Snares Islands has been separated as a full species, the Snares snipe (C. huegeli), as have the extinct South Island (C. iredalei) and North Island snipes (C. barrierensis). Description The Subantarctic snipe is a small wading bird with adults growing to about in length. It has cryptic brown plumage, sturdy legs and a slender beak about long. The head is striped in black and reddish brown and the body is brown, mottled with black and reddish brown. Distribution The Subantarctic snipe is endemic to certain islands to the south of New Zealand. Each island or group of islands has its own subspecies. New Zealand formerly had two mainland species of snipe, but both of these are extinct. The South Island snipe (C. iredalei) became extinct on Jacky Lee Island when the flightless weka was introduced and on Big South Cape Island(both the former and the latter muttonbird islands south of Stewart Island), its last refuge after black rats (Rattus rattus) arrived there in 1964. The last North Island Snipe (C. barrierensis) was seen in 1870 on Little Barrier Island. The Campbell Island Snipe (C. a. perseverance) were nearly extinguished but a few remained on an outlying islet and recolonised the main island when rats were exterminated there. A further two subspecies are the Antipodes snipe(C. a. meinertzhagenae) on the Antipodes Islands and the Auckland Island snipe(C. a. aucklandica) on the Auckland Islands. The Snares Island snipe (Coenocorypha huegeli) was formerly thought to be a subspecies of the Subantarctic snipe, but is now recognised as a separate species. Behaviour The Subantarctic snipe seldom flies, is relatively tame and nests on the ground and this puts it at risk of predation by land-based predators. It favours areas of dense ground cover and feeds on a range of invertebrates. It has a characteristic courtship display which takes place at night when males make vertical dives from considerable heights. Nesting takes place at different dates between August and January on the different islands. References * Miskelly, Colin M. (1987): The identity of the hakawai. Notornis 34(2): 95-116.

Metals and alloys exhibit phenomena such as stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement, liquid metal embrittlement and corrosion fatigue all coming under this category. Environments such as moist air, sea water and corrosive liquids and gases cause environmental stress fracture. Metal matrix composites are also susceptible to many of these processes. Plastics and plastic-based composites may suffer swelling, debonding and loss of strength when exposed to organic fluids and other corrosive environments, such as acids and alkalies. Under the influence of stress and environment, many structural materials, particularly the high-specific strength ones become brittle and lose their resistance to fracture. While their fracture toughness remains unaltered, their threshold stress intensity factor for crack propagation may be considerably lowered. Consequently, they become prone to premature fracture because of sub-critical crack growth. This article aims to give a brief overview of the various degradation processes mentioned above. Stress corrosion cracking A .35 Remington cartridge that has experienced season cracking Stress corrosion cracking is a phenomenon where a synergistic action of corrosion and tensile stress leads to brittle fracture of normally ductile materials at generally lower stress levels. During stress corrosion cracking, the material is relatively unattacked by the corrosive agent, but fine cracks form within it. This process has serious implications on the utility of the material because the applicable safe stress levels are drastically reduced in the corrosive medium. Season cracking and caustic embrittlement are two stress corrosion cracking processes which affected the serviceability of brass cartridge cases and riveted steel boilers respectively. Hydrogen embrittlement Small quantities of hydrogen present inside certain metallic materials make the latter brittle and susceptible to sub-critical crack growth under stress. Some materials may exhibit a marked decrease in their load carrying capacity and fail in a brittle fashion when stressed in an atmosphere containing hydrogen. Both of these processes may be called hydrogen embrittlement. Hydrogen embrittlement may occur as a side effect of electroplating processes. Delayed failure, the fracture of a component under stress after an elapsed time, is a characteristic feature of hydrogen embrittlement (2). Hydrogen entry into the material may be affected during melting, casting, welding, and service life. Corrosion during service in moist environments generates hydrogen, part of which may enter the metal and cause embrittlement. Presence of a tensile stress, either inherent or externally applied, is necessary for metals to be damaged. As in the case of stress corrosion cracking, hydrogen embrittlement may also lead to a decrease in the threshold stress intensity factor for crack propagation or an increase in the sub critical crack growth velocity of the material. The most visible effect of hydrogen in materials is a drastic reduction in ductility during tensile tests. It may increase, decrease or leave unaffected the yield strength of the material. Hydrogen may cause serrated yielding in certain metals such as niobium, nickel and some steels (3). Over the years several theories have been proposed to explain hydrogen embrittlement. Pressure theory (4) and surface adsorption theory (5) are among the earliest of these. Later, decohesion theory (6) and slip softening theory (7) were introduced to resolve defects in the earlier theories. The hydride embrittlement theory (8) explains the behavior of hydride forming metals such as magnesium, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, uranium. The collapsed Silver Bridge, as seen from the Ohio side Case studies One of the worst disasters caused by stress corrosion cracking was the fall of the Silver Bridge, WV in 1967, when a single brittle crack formed by rusting grew to criticality. The crack was on one of the tie bar links of one of the suspension chains, and the whole joint failed quickly by overload. The event escalated and the whole bridge disappeared in less than a minute, killing 46 drivers or passengers on the bridge at the time. See also  References #Mars G.

This municipality was established on 18 May 2014 by merging with existing Dharampani and Bandipur VDCs. Because of its preserved, old time cultural atmosphere, Bandipur has increasingly been coming to the attention of tourism. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of total (Bandipur and Dharampani) 15,591 people living in 3750 individual households.. It is one of the best tourist destinations of Nepal. Bandipur is famous for Newari people and their cultures. Location Bandipur is located at 27.56 N, 84.25 E and an elevation of 1030m on a mountain saddle (Mahabharat range) approximately 700m above the Marsyangdi River Valley, 143 km to the west of Kathmandu and 80 km to the east of Pokhara. Since 1998 it is connected by an 8 km access road from Dumre (Prithvi Highway). Until then there was only an unreliable road, in monsoon usually not accessible or only by tractors. The mountain saddle, just 200m long, is barely wide enough to accommodate the main street lined by 2 ‚Äì3 storey buildings on either side. At the backsides of these houses the mountainsides steeply descend and the gardens are only accessible by stairs. History Bandipur was established as a funnelling point of trade by Newar traders from Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu valley after it had been conquered in 1768 by Prithvi Narayan Shah. They took advantage of its malaria free location to develop it into an important stop along the India-Tibet trade route. With them they brought their cultural heritage and architecture which basically has remained unchanged to this day. Originally a simple Magar village in the early 19th. Century Bandipur developed into prosperous trading centre and a community with town- like features: substantial buildings, with their neoclassical fa√ßades and shuttered windows and streets paved with slabs of silverish slate. Bandipur had its heyday in the Rana times (1846-1951), when, as a measure of its power and prestige, it was granted special permission to have its own library (still existing). In the 1970s, trading fell into a steep decline with the construction of the Prithvi Highway. For technical reasons it was logically built in the Marsyangdi valley, leaving Bandipur isolated up on the mountain. In addition to that, as a result of its poor accessibility, Bandipur lost importance because the district headquarters of Tanahun were moved to Damauli. The tradesmen of Bandipur were forced to move down to Dumre and many even left for the Terai; Bandipur turned a semi-ghost town. The population declined considerably. On two occasions Bandipur has witnessed some turmoil. The people were not easily and readily sidestepped by the construction of the road and fought for a different route in the planning process. In the 1970s, when the first demonstrations for democracy took place in Nepal, the people of Bandipur stormed the little garrison. Several people were killed and the soldiers fled. Again, when the district headquarters were to be moved, the people demonstrated and occupied the administration. The civil servants fled during the night. Even the king was flown in by helicopter to calm the situation. However, the decline of the little town could not be reversed. Some relics of its wealthy past remain. Although many houses are in bad condition, the typical Newari architecture is preserved. A distinctive aspect of Bandipur's main street is a covered veranda extending along almost the entire length on the northern side. Most of the buildings still have little shops in them. The slate slabs in the main street have been destroyed by heavy vehicles, for which they were not made, but they can still be made out along the edges and in the smaller alleys. The library still exists and was carefully renovated in 2000. Another relic is a soccer-field-sized Tundikhel to the northeast of Bandipur and the villages importance as centre for schools for the surrounding villages. Municipality Bandipur Heights A cabinet meeting held at the Prime Minister's Office, Singha Durbar on May 8, 2014, Thursday announced additional 72 municipalities, including previously-proposed 37 municipalities in line with the Local Self-governance Act 1999. With this announcement Bandipur has been upgraded as one of the municipalities of Nepal, previously it was proposed municipality. Adjoining Dharampani VDC was merged with Bandipur to upgrade it to the municipality. From June 2, 2014, Monday onward with the inauguration program Bandipur village committee, formally started functioning as Bandipur Municipality. Education The educational institutes in Bandipur are Bhanu Higher Secondary School established in the 1950s, only institution offering higher education till the 1980s. Notre Dame Higher Secondary School was established in 1985, by the \\"School Sisters of Notre Dame\\" a Catholic missionary organization. It is one of the best schools in Nepal with a track record of 100% First Division pass out in the Higher Secondary Board Examination since its students appeared for Board Examination(SLC). The legacy is till today. Bandipur has only one public graduate college \\"Bandipur Campus\\" affiliate to Tribhuvan University and offering Bachelor in Education program. Bandipur has few lower secondary schools beside above mentioned namely Dil Primary School, Ratna Rajya Middle School, Believers Academy. Bandipur Campus Building Bhanu School Social Organizations Bandipur hosts number of social organizations like social youth forum, public library, child club. Padma library is one of the oldest libraries in Nepal, established in Rana regime itself. Many social organizations have arisen and faded, Tindhara Youth Cultural Group (TYC-Group) is the only active youth club (social youth forum) established in 1998. Initially it was a loose forum and was registered under District Administrative Office in 2003. Founder president of TYC-Group is Mr. Firoz Kumar Shrestha succeeded by Mr. Tara Bhattarai, Mr. Ravi Shrestha, Mr. Suman Sun Shrestha, Mr. Purendra Shrestha and current president is Mr. Rajan Bhattarai. Hoste Haise Child Development Society is another social organization working in child development and children right sector. Other social organizations to be named are Bhanu School Operation Committee, Bandipur Hospital Development Committee, Raniban Social Committee, Tindhara Development Committee. Eco-Cultural Project Bandipur Eco Cultural Tourism Project (BECT-Project) is the project that lift the face of Bandipur as one of the major tourist destinations of Nepal. BECT-Project had assistance of EuropeAid. This project was a part of a European Commission/Asia Urbs-funded partnership project with the two European partner cities: Municipality of Hydra, Greece Hydra (island) and Commune d Riomaggiore, Italy Riomaggiore. Its objectives were to develop and promote Bandipur as a unique tourist destination: enhance, upgrade and conserve the built and natural environment of Bandipur; and support local enterprises to revitalize economic activities, ultimately extending the length of tourists stay in Bandipur. Ethnicity Formerly a Magar village, Bandipur today is settled by a variety of Nepali ethnicities with different beliefs: the Bahuns, the Chhetris, the Newars, the Damais, Kamis, Sarkis, Kasais, the Magars and Gurungs. 207x207px 167x167px Its medium elevation, excellent view of the Himalayas (Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Manaslu, Ganesh, Langtang Himal, the Marsyangdi Valley, Mount Manakamana and Gorkha with its high perching palace), relatively easy accessibility and, of course, old Newari town flair, make Bandipur an interesting tourist site from which a few guesthouses and a hotel at the northern end of the Tundikhel try to benefit. It may well be that the seclusion of Bandipur saved the Newari architecture of its buildings which otherwise would have been replaced by faceless modern types found in many other towns of Nepal. The various Newari and Magar festivals, which until recently have been held for their own purposes several times a year, can be of interest to tourists too. Sorathi and Chutka dances are very popular. Due to the distance and poor accessibility of many of the home villages of pupils at Bandipur schools a number of houses have been turned into boarding houses. Many Magar and Gurung men serve as Gurkha soldiers. Thani Mai Other attractions include the Bindyabashini temple and the library in the village centre, Thani Mai, Tindhara (‚ÄúThree Taps‚Äù washing place at the southeastern outskirts), Raniban (Queen's Forest), the downhill trek to the Siddha Cave and a hike to Ramkot village. On Mukundeswari, the elevation at the western end of the saddle is a little shrine and one has a view of Bandipur itself. Lamjung Phant Some villagers have picked up growing oranges, which do quite well in the climate of that area. An hour's walk to the west of Bandipur is a silk farm.

These names are older and nearly obsolete general terms from psychiatry, referring to many physical disorders that cause impaired mental function. They are meant to exclude psychiatric disorders (mental disorders). Originally, the term was created to distinguish physical (termed \\"organic\\") causes of mental impairment from psychiatric (termed \\"functional\\") disorders, but during the era when this distinction was drawn, not enough was known about brain science (including neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and mind-brain correlation) for this cause-based classification to be more than educated guesswork labeled with misplaced certainty, which is why it has been deemphasized in current medicine. While mental or behavioural abnormalities related to the dysfunction can be permanent, treating the disease early may prevent permanent damage in addition to fully restoring mental functions. An organic cause to brain dysfunction is suspected when there is no indication of a clearly defined psychiatric or \\"inorganic\\" cause, such as a mood disorder.  Types  Organic brain syndrome can be divided into 2 major subgroups: acute (delirium or acute confusional state) and chronic (dementia). A third entity, encephalopathy (amnestic), denotes a gray zone between delirium and dementia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has broken up the diagnoses that once fell under the diagnostic category organic mental disorder into three categories: delirium, dementia, and amnestic. = Delirium = Delirium or Acute organic brain syndrome is a recently appearing state of mental impairment, as a result of intoxication, drug overdose, infection, pain, and many other physical problems affecting mental status. In medical contexts, \\"acute\\" means \\"of recent onset\\". As is the case with most acute disease problems, acute organic brain syndrome is often temporary, although this does not guarantee that it will not recur or progress to become chronic, that is, long-term. A more specific medical term for the acute subset of organic brain syndromes is delirium. Thinking, remembering, sleeping, and paying attention can become difficult during alcohol withdrawal, after surgery, or with dementia. = Dementia = Dementia or chronic organic brain syndrome is long- term. For example, some forms of chronic drug or alcohol dependence can cause organic brain syndrome due to their long-lasting or permanent toxic effects on brain function. Other common causes of chronic organic brain syndrome sometimes listed are the various types of dementia, which result from permanent brain damage due to strokes, Alzheimer's disease, or other damaging causes which are irreversible. Amnestic pertains to amnesia and is the impairment in ability to learn or recall new information, or recall previously learned information. Although similar, it is not coupled with dementia or delirium. = Amnestic = Amnestic conditions denotes a gray zone between delirium and dementia; its early course may fluctuate, but it is often persistent and progressive. Damage to brain functioning could be due not only to organic (physical) injury (a severe blow to the head, stroke, chemical and toxic exposures, organic brain disease, substance abuse, etc.) and also to non-organic means such as severe deprivation, abuse, neglect, and severe psychological trauma. Symptoms Many of the symptoms of Organic Mental Disorder depend on the cause of the disorder, but are similar and include physical or behavioral elements. Dementia and delirium are the cause of the confusion, orientation, cognition or alertness impairment. Therefore, these symptoms require more attention because hallucinations, delusions, amnesia, and personality changes are the result. These effects of the dementia and delirium are not joined with the changes of sensory or perception abilities. Memory impairment, judgment, logical function and agitation are also some extremely common symptoms. The more common symptoms of OBS are confusion; impairment of memory, judgment, and intellectual function; and agitation. Often these symptoms are attributed to psychiatric illness, which causes a difficulty in diagnosis. =Associated conditions= Disorders that are related to injury or damage to the brain and contribute to OBS include, but are not limited to: *Alcoholism *Alzheimer's disease *Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorderhttp://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2008/en#/F07.8 *Autism *Concussion *Encephalitis *Epilepsy *Fetal alcohol syndrome *Hypoxia *Parkinson's disease *Intoxication/overdose caused by drug abuse including alcoholism *Sedative hypnotic dependence and drug abuse *Intracranial hemorrhage/trauma *Korsakoff syndrome *Mastocytosis *Meningitis *Psychoorganic syndrome *Stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) *Withdrawal from drugs, especially sedative hypnotics, e.g. alcohol or benzodiazepines Other conditions that may be related to organic brain syndrome include: clinical depression, neuroses, and psychoses, which may occur simultaneously with the OBS. Treatment While the treatment depends on which particular disorder is involved in Organic Mental Disorder, a few that are possible. Treatments can include, but are not limited to, rehabilitation therapy such as physical or occupational, pharmacological modification of the neurotransmitter function, or medication. The affected parts of the brain can recover some function with the help of different types of therapy. Online therapy can be just as intense and helpful as rehabilitation therapy, in person, and can help those affected regain function in daily life.  Prognosis  Some disorders are short-term and treatable, and their prognosis is not as lengthy. Rest and medication are the most common courses of action for these treatable cases to help the patient return to proper health. Many of the cases are long-term, and there is not as much of a set and defined prognosis. The course of action can include extensive counseling and therapy. There are many reasons that the long-term cases are harder to treat and these include these cases normally get worse over time, and medication or therapy could not work. In this case, many of the prognosis tracks are to help the patient and their family become more comfortable and understand what will happen. =Associated conditions= * Brain injury caused by trauma ** Bleeding into the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage) ** Bleeding into the space around the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage) ** Blood clot inside the skull causing pressure on brain (subdural hematoma) ** Concussion * Breathing conditions ** Low oxygen in the body (hypoxia) ** High carbon dioxide levels in the body (hypercapnia) * Cardiovascular disorders ** Abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmias) ** Brain injury due to high blood pressure (hypertensive brain injury) ** Dementia due to many strokes (multi-infarct dementia) ** Heart infections (endocarditis, myocarditis) ** Stroke ** Transient ischemic attack (TIA) * Degenerative disorders ** Alzheimer's disease (also called senile dementia, Alzheimer's type) ** Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease ** Diffuse Lewy Body disease ** Huntington's disease ** Multiple sclerosis ** Normal pressure hydrocephalus ** Parkinson's disease ** Pick's disease * Dementia due to metabolic causes * Drug and alcohol-related conditions ** Alcohol withdrawal state ** Intoxication from drug or alcohol use ** Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome (a long- term effect of excessive alcohol consumption or malnutrition) ** Withdrawal from drugs (especially sedative-hypnotics and corticosteroids) * Infections ** Any sudden onset (acute) or long-term (chronic) infection ** Blood poisoning (sepsis) ** Brain infection (encephalitis) ** Meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) ** Prion infections such as mad cow disease ** Late-stage syphilis (general paresis) * Other medical disorders ** Cancer ** Kidney disease ** Liver disease ** Thyroid disease (high or low) ** Vitamin deficiency (B1, B12, or folate) * Lithium toxicity can cause permanent organic brain damage * Accumulation of heavy metals in the brains ** Aluminum ** Mercury poisoning References  External links  *AllRefer Health.com. 13 December 2006.

Significantly, it gives Ontario residents the right to participate in environmental decision-making. From 1993 to 2019 the provincial government's compliance with the EBR was monitored by the Environmental Commissioner of Ontario, a non-partisan officer of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Since the dissolution of the ECO's office in 2019, responsibility for overseeing the EBR has been the responsibility of the Auditor General of Ontario. The EBR gives citizens the right, under specific circumstances: *to be notified and to comment on environmentally significant government proposals, using the Environmental Registry; *to ask a ministry to review a law or to investigate harm to the environment *to appeal a ministry decision *to sue for harm to a public resource *to sue for public nuisance causing environmental harm *to be protected from employer reprisals for using the above rights. The EBR also lays out responsibilities for those ministries that are prescribed: *to develop and publish a Statement of Environmental Values, a statement that guides the ministry when it makes decisions that might affect the environment. The ministry must consider its SEV when it makes an environmentally significant decision.

It existed under the name New York City League for Sexual Freedom to promote and conduct sexual activity among its members and to agitate for political reform, especially for the repeal of laws against abortion and censorship, and had many female leaders.  History  = West coast formation = When Jefferson Poland moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, he started the East Bay Sexual Freedom League there, near the University of California, Berkeley in 1966. Although Poland founded the League, he did not try to establish it as a conventional organization with membership lists, dues and meetings. Instead, he went around establishing various Leagues and allowing others to run them. The League first made national news in August, 1965 with the \\"Nude Wade-in\\" led by Poland, 23, Ina Saslow, 21, and Shirley Einseidel, 21, at Aquatic Park, a public beach in San Francisco. The S.F.L. was featured in an article in Time magazine for March 11, 1966, which attracted thousands of curiosity seekers and a few active participants. In early 1966 Poland transferred the East Bay League to Richard Thorne, who proceeded to organize nude parties, which were thinly disguised sex orgies. Thorne fled to Mexico in the summer of 1966, later changed his name to Ohm and started a religion by that name. = Split = Following Thorne's departure, a rift developed. One faction wanted members to have open meetings and discussions about sex but not actually to engage in sexual relations. The other wanted to continue the tradition of orgies. The non-sex branch was headed by Linda Lindvall and the pro-sex branch by Sam Sloan, a student at the University of California at Berkeley. Sloan's faction was recognized by UC Berkeley as an official, registered on-campus student organization under the modified name \\"Campus Sexual Rights Forum,\\" because the Dean of Students would not agree to register it under the name \\"Sexual Freedom League.\\" The Sloan group set up an S.F.L. information table on campus and distributed literature, held rallies and sold buttons to finance its activities on campus, while holding orgies (mostly involving Berkeley students) off campus. It was featured in articles in Time, Playboy, and Sexology magazines as well as in numerous articles in the San Francisco Chronicle, the Berkeley Gazette, and the Berkeley Barb. Starting in 1970, through 1975, Sexual Freedom League Member Arlene Elster owned and ran the Sutter Cinema, showing quality pornographic movies \\"that consisted of more than a penis going in a vagina\\". Besides many arrests, the lack of quality films to show was one reason for the theater's demise The other faction, the East Bay S.F.L., established headquarters in Oakland. Instead of holding nude parties it formed \\"circles,\\" including the \\"Horny Men's Circle\\" and the \\"Wanton Women's Circle.\\" Even so, the Coordinator (Chairman) of these circles, Lisa Lindvall, also participated in the sex orgies of the campus group. By December, 1966, the East Bay Sexual Freedom League, forced by competition from Sam Sloan's Campus Sexual Freedom League and also by the influence of an article in the September \\"Back to School\\" issue of Playboy which Sloan helped to write, started holding nude parties and sex orgies again. = Leaving the East Bay = The Campus Sexual Freedom League disappeared when Sloan left town due to an arrest in April 1967. The last of its 28 nude parties took place on Christmas Eve of that year. By then the East Bay League had also folded and Alida Reyenga had moved to Los Angeles, where she took up Scientology.Berkeley Daily Gazette Tuesday April 25, 1967 Samuel Howard Sloan, Party host for Sexual Freedom Forum parties at 2714 Telegraph Avenue, was given 12 hours to vacate the premises by Berkeley-Albany Judge George Braun yesterday. Sloan, 22, was arrested by Berkeley police over the weekend for contributing to the delinquency of a minor and for possession of marijuana. Judge Braun ordered the bail reduced on the contributing charge to $550 from $2,200 and to $1,000 on the marijuana charge on the condition Sloan will vacate the \\"orgy house\\" across the street from Willard Junior High School and if he will avoid associating with minors at any party involving alcoholic beverages. His case was put over to Monday at 2 pm for plea. The Telegraph Avenue Party Pad was raided by Berkeley police Saturday night, armed with a warrant for Sloan's arrest and a search warrant. Both were issued on the basis of findings made by officers when they arrested two Oakland juveniles who had attended a party at the house and were caught drinking alcohol outside. Sloan told officers he may move his 'operation' to Emeryville. Source: http://www.anusha.com/orgyhost.jpg While the East Bay versions were dying out, other chapters sprouted up all over California, and the San Francisco Sexual Freedom League emerged at the forefront. It was at first headed by Margo St. James, who claimed to be a \\"former prostitute\\" and participated in social activism while she organized sex orgies, then taken over by Frank and Margo Rila, with ongoing involvement of Jefferson Poland, and members such as Mother Boats. Frank, who edited the Sexual Freedom newspaper, eventually committed suicide. Margo St. James ran for San Francisco Board of Supervisors many times but all without success. She has often been criticized by feminists such as Dorchen Leidholdt.

He was appointed to a five-year term in 2000 and was reappointed to this position in 2005 and 2010 for two consecutive five-year terms. Early life Before his appointment, he worked for the Ontario Ministry of the Environment for 14 years as a scientist, manager of training and development, and as a district manager. He also helped to set up the advocacy organization Ontario Public Interest Group Guelph.Miller received an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in Biology in 1976 and a Master of Science degree in Plant ecology in 1978, both from the University of Guelph. Tenure as environment commissioner As environment commissioner, Miller issued strongly-worded reports annually, calling the province to account on its environmental commitments. Starting in 2008, he added special reports on greenhouse gas emissions and energy conservation. Miller did not shy away from direct criticism of government decisions and longstanding abuses in law. An early example was his direct condemnation of SLAPP lawsuits for their negative effect on public advocacy. Miller's reports very strongly supported \\"environmental activists\\" who argued, \\"the practice is widespread in the development industry and used to pacify activists and environmentalists\\", that is, silence them with fear of civil liability. Ontario passed an anti-SLAPP law in 2010. In 2013 Miller called to public attention the fact that Ontario‚Äôs cabinet had allocated to itself, in the 2012 budget, the power to turn over public land to the exclusive control of private, multinational corporations. In a formal report Miller said that this, combined with cuts to staff and programs at Ministries of Natural Resources and the Environment, all \\"quietly and without public consultation\\", led to a situation with \\"no rules\\". Other actions were, Miller said, \\"gutting\\" protections for species at risk and that it was time for hydraulic fracturing regulation. In 2014 Miller warned that Ontario had done \\"very little\\" other than closing coal plants to meet its 2020 emissions targets, and had failed to build transit and other efficient infrastructure. =Appointment controversy= Miller's sharp turn on the Harper government ended a longstanding controversy. Due to his two prior candidacies, Miller's initial appointment raised the perception by the NDP and Liberal caucuses that he was a Conservative partisan. Opposition parties at Queen's Park accused the Harris government of using its majority to name a Conservative as Ontario's environment commissioner. Miller was subsequently re-appointed twice by two successive parliaments headed by Liberal governments, whom he sharply criticized. Politics Miller was, in addition to a former federal and provincial PC candidate, the president of the federal Conservative riding association in Nipissing, home riding of then-Premier Mike Harris. On May 19, 2015, Miller sought the Green Party of Canada nomination for the seat of Guelph in the upcoming Canadian federal election, and on June 8, 2015, he was selected to run. He had gone to university there in 1977-79 and helped found the Ontario Public Interest Research Group in Guelph. Miller had also previously run for provincial Progressive Conservatives in 1995 and in 1997 for Jean Charest's federal Progressive Conservatives. He said the 2015 Conservative Party of Canada \\"is not like and doesn't represent the points of view\\" of those parties: \\"We thought we were uniting the right, instead we united the wrong\\". Miller was considered a star candidate by local media. From his first public appearance he sharply criticized all the other parties for \\"committing to pursuing an economy based on bitumen from Alberta that we'll never be able to extract\\", echoing former Bank of Canada head Mark Carney's formal raising of this issue at the Financial Stability Board and Bank of England in 2014. Miller also accused the government of \\"silencing\\" scientists and called Bill C-51 \\"a terrible piece of legislation.\\" Electoral record See also *Environmental Bill of Rights References  External links * Environmental Commissioner of Ontario * Gord Miller's MP campaign page for Guelph Category:1953 births Category:20th-century Canadian civil servants Category:21st-century Canadian civil servants Category:Canadian biologists Category:Green Party of Canada candidates in the 2015 Canadian federal election Category:Green Party of Canada candidates in the 2019 Canadian federal election Category:Living people Category:University of Guelph alumni ","title":"Gord Miller (environmental commissioner)"},{"id":"3905991","text":"The white-naped tit (Machlolophus nuchalis), sometimes called white-winged tit, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is endemic to India where it is found in dry thorn scrub forest in two disjunct populations, in western India and southern India. Its specific name nuchalis means ‚Äòof the nuchal, nape‚Äô. This species is hard to mistake with its contrasting black and white patterns without the grey wing coverts and back of the partly sympatric cinereous tit (Parus cinereus). This species is very patchily distributed and has been considered to be vulnerable to extinction especially because of the scarcity of suitable habitats particularly nest cavities made by woodpeckers. Taxonomy The white-naped tit was formerly one of the many species in the genus Parus but was moved to Machlolophus after a molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 showed that the members of the new genus formed a distinct clade. Description From Jerdon's Illustrations of Indian Ornithology (1847) The only pied (black-and-white) tit in India, this species has the wing-coverts, crown, sides of head, chin, throat, a ventral band running down the breast and belly to the vent black. The cheeks below the eye, the ear-coverts and a patch on the nape are white. The wing has white on the outer primaries and the base of the secondaries. The last tertiaries are completely white. The two outer tail feathers are white while the next has the outer web white and the remaining black. The white of the flanks can be suffused with yellow. Distribution and habitat This species was discovered in the Eastern Ghats near Nellore by T C Jerdon who received a specimen from a local hunter. A specimen was later obtained in 1863 from near Bangalore and for a long time the species was not observed anywhere in southern India. A O Hume had suggested in that the two populations might represent different species. The southern population was subsequently noted when Salim Ali collected specimens from the Biligirirangan Hills. The species occurs in the nearby Kaveri valley area where Parus cinereus stupae is also found. The species has also been reported from the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. Salim Ali had claimed that the two species were mutually exclusive, however there is no support for this. The distribution in western India is larger and better known, ranging mainly in areas of Kutch and extending into parts of Rajasthan and Haryana. A specimen in the British Museum marked as being from Bootan (Bhutan) is considered to be in error. Records from Wynaad, Anshi National Park and Dharwad have also been considered doubtful. Behaviour and ecology These birds are believed to live at very low densities in small numbers. They are shy and are best detected by their calls which have been described as musical whistling notes tee-whi-whi or see pit-pit-pit-pit. They however appear to show high fidelity to favoured sites. Some roost hollows have been observed to have been known to have been used for more than six years. The birds feed on insects and the berries of Salvadora oleiodes. They may also obtain nectar from the flowers of Capparis aphylla and will sometimes visit rainwater puddles to drink. The breeding season in Rajasthan is during the monsoons, from May to August. The nest is a pad of fibre and hair placed inside a cavity typically on a tree. They choose cavities made by woodpeckers and coppersmith barbets. Nests have been found in old trees of Salvadora persica and Boswellia serrata. The clutch size is not known but adults with three young have been observed. The female develops a brood-patch and it is not known if the male incubates. Both parents take part in care of the chicks. The chicks are fed mainly with non-hairy caterpillars, the parents may bring food as late as 2000 Hrs in the evening. It is said to be dependent on old woodpeckers nest holes, especially those made by yellow-crowned woodpeckers, which are used for nesting and roosting. Suggestions that the species might migrate from western to southern India have been made but have not found support and birds (including juveniles) have been seen in southern India during summer. Birds ringed in western India have been recaptured within a radius of 5 to 7 km. Breeding has not been studied in the southern population. This species is said to have undergone a rapid population decline in the recent past. The habitat of dense Acacia scrub is severely degraded and fragmented in western India especially due to the collection of old branches with potential nest holes for firewood.

Members of Thermotoga are hyperthermophilic bacteria whose cell is wrapped in a unique sheath-like outer membrane, called a \\"toga\\". The members of the phylum stain Gram-negative as they possess a thin peptidoglycan in between two lipid bilayers, albeit both peculiar. The peptidoglycan is unusual as the crosslink is not only meso- diaminopimelate as occurs in Proteobacteria, but D-lysine.All proteinogenic amino acids have the L- configuration; in peptidoglycan some amino acids with the D- configuration are present. Lysine is synthesised from meso-diaminopimelate by Diaminopimelate decarboxylase. The species are anaerobes with varying degrees of oxygen tolerance. They are capable of reducing elemental sulphur (S0) to hydrogen sulphide, which in turn can be used. Whether thermophily is an innovation of the lineage or an ancestral trait is unclear and cannot be determined. The genome of Thermotoga maritima was sequenced in 1999, revealing several genes of archaeal origin, possibly allowing its thermophilic adaptation. The CG (cytosine-guanine) content of T. maritima is 46.2%; most thermophiles in fact have high CG content; this has led to the speculation that CG content may be a non-essential consequence to thermophily and not the driver towards thermophily. Members and relatives The type species of the genus is T. maritima, first described in 1986. At the time, it was the first species of the phylum to be described. The genus Thermotoga now contains nine official species, while the phylum contains a single family (Thermotogaceae) with ten official genera (Fervidobacterium, Geotoga, Kosmotoga, Marinitoga,Mesotoga, Petrotoga, Thermococcoides, Thermosipho, Thermotoga and Oceanotoga). T. subterranea strain SL1 was found in a 70 ¬∞C deep continental oil reservoir in the East Paris Basin, France. The precise relation of the Thermotogae to other phyla is debated (v. bacterial phyla): several studies have found it to be deep-branching (in Bergey's manual it appeared in fact in \\"Volume I: The Archaea and the deeply branching and phototrophic Bacteria\\"), while other have found Firmicutes to be deep-branching with Thermotogae clustering away from the base. Name The paper and the chapter in Bergey's manual were authored by several authors including the microbiologists Karl Stetter and Carl Woese. The new Latin feminine name \\"thermotoga\\" means \\"the hot outer garment\\", being a combination of the Greek noun Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒºŒ∑ (therme, heat) or more correctly the adjective Œ∏ŒµœÅŒºœåœÇ, ŒÆ, œåŒΩ (thermos, e, on, hot) and the Latin feminine noun toga (the Roman outer garment).

Early life Poland was born in Indiana in 1942. \\"Jefferson Poland was born in Indiana in 1942\\" He became a student at Florida State University and majored in Sociology. He was expelled from that university in 1960 for his integrationist work with the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE). He participated with the Freedom Riders in Florida and in June, 1961 was one of the \\"Tallahassee Ten\\" who were arrested for unlawful assembly at a segregated airport restaurant. A year later, he was involved in Ban the Bomb activities. Poland moved to California and worked as an agricultural labor organizer, renting a room in the home of Dolores Huerta. He worked with CORE to register black voters in Louisiana in the summer of 1963. Poland participated in one of the first known LGBT rights demonstrations in the United States. Poland, along with organizer Randy Wicker and several others, picketed the Whitehall Induction Center in New York City to protest the US military's exclusion of homosexuals from military service and the violation of confidentiality of gay men's draft records. Sources differ on the date of this demonstration, with some citing 1963 and others 1964. Sexual Freedom League In 1963, Poland founded the Sexual Freedom League in New York City with Leo Koch. He then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and focused his organizing efforts near the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University. Poland founded various chapters, including ones in the East Bay, San Francisco, Berkeley and San Diego. However, he did not run these organizations himself; he would found them and then turn them over to others. Poland was a graduate student at San Francisco State University. Poland, on August 25, 1965, conducted a \\"Nude Wade-in\\" he led with Ina Saslow and Shirley Einseidel at Aquatic Park, a public beach in San Francisco. This event was reported in the San Francisco Chronicle and Time. At least one UPI photo of this event is archived at the Library of Congress. Poland, calling himself \\"Jefferson Fuck Poland\\", had, in 1966, his name legally changed thereto and identifying as bisexual. While at San Francisco State University, Poland with Blair Paltridge, were connected with a magazine called Open Process. They were suspended for printing and writing obscene material in the November 14, 1967, issue of the magazine. Poland was a subject and contributor to the underground newspaper the Berkeley Barb. In 1968, Poland signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post In May 1968, the Diggers theater group held an event they called the \\"Free City Convention,\\" at the Fillmore West (then known as the Carousel Ballroom) when Poland held a sex orgy. Poland, after attempting to attend the Berkeley City Council meeting of September 22, 1970, was arrested and later convicted of disturbing the peace and interfering with a police officer in the line of duty. He served 90 days at Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center near Dublin. Psychedelic Venus Church In 1970, Poland founded the Psychedelic Venus Church (PsyVen or PVC), an offshoot of the Sexual Freedom League, with Mother Boats becoming President. He felt that the leadership of the Sexual Freedom League was becoming too \\"bourgeois\\". The (entheogenic) sacrament of the Psychedelic Venus Church was marijuana and, after lighting up, at each meeting a woman was chosen to be Venus. At the beginning of services, she was placed on an altar, candles were lit on each side of her, and her vulva was smeared with honey. Each of the males (and some women if so inclined) at the meeting licked the woman's vulva in order to honor the goddess Venus. Then the orgy began in earnest. Meetings continued in the San Francisco Bay Area until 1972.The Records of the San Francisco Sexual Freedom League by Jefferson F. Poland and Valerie Alison with preface by Herbert Gold, Olympia Press, 1971 The Church had 700 members by 1971 but disbanded in 1973. Jefferson Poland Archive Poland turned over his archives to the Bancroft Library of the University of California, Berkeley, where they are now available for public viewing by academic researchers. Sex offense, flight, and name change By 1980, Poland had moved to San Diego. In 1983, Poland was charged with molesting the 8 or 9 year daughter of an acquaintance whom he babysat. Poland fled the country and he lived for five years as a fugitive in India, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1988, he was arrested in Hawaii. By that time he had changed his last name legally to \\"Clitlick\\". He pled no-contest to California Penal Code 288(a), \\"lewd or lascivious act with a child under 14 years of age,\\" a felony, and was a sentenced to a year in prison and to register as a sex offender. Personal life Poland moved back to San Francisco in the 1990s and lived near the Civic Center, San Francisco.

Map of Hseni Township It is north of Lashio. It is above sea level. Page 8 After the disruption of the Dali Kingdom by Kublai Khan, Theinni seems to have been the centre of the independent Shan princely states, with various capitals in the Shweli River and Nam Tu River valleys. This kingdom of Kawsampi was ended by the Burmese about 1738, and the country was divided into various states, with appointment orders from Ava. Numerous rebellions and civil wars reduced Theinni from its position as the most powerful and populous Shan state to a condition of fearful desolation. It later regained much population since the British occupation in 1888, but is still far from its old prosperity. The ruins of what was the old capital of Hsenwi State lie at a short distance, and show it to have been a large and well-built town.} History =Historical background= It was the capital of Hsenwi State, by far the largest of the cis-Salween Shan states, and at one time included not only all the territory of the present states of North and South Hsenwi, but also Kehsi Mansam, Mong Hsu, Mong Sang, and Mong Nawng, besides having a sort of protectorate over Mang Lon and other Wa states east of the Salween. These had, however, fallen away in Burmese times, and before the British annexation, Theinni was divided into five parts by name; but there was no central authority, and the whole state was in hopeless disorder. After the pacification of the region in March 1888, the colonial administration divided Theinni into two states: North Theinni, which was assigned to a successful adventurer, Hkun Sang, of Ton Hong, and South Theinni which went to Nawmong, of the old Shan ruling house. North Theinni with an area of had a population (1901) of 118,325 persons; estimated revenue, ¬£6000. South Theinni with an area of had a population (in 1901) of 67,836; estimated revenue, ¬£4800. Mong Yai was the capital of South Theinni, with a population of about 2000. Lashio, the headquarters of the superintendent of the Northern Shan State, is in North Theinni.http://www.battle-of-qurman.com.cn/literature/Luce- BurmaJournal-1925.pdf Page 120 There were total 16 rulers in Hsenwi from 1778 to 1888.http://www.uq.net.au/~zzhsoszy/states/burma/hsenwi.html US Air Force attacked it several times during World War II.http://books.stonebooks.com/record/1000693/ \\"29 October, 1 November, 11 November and 1 December 1944\\" Kokang was part of the Hsenwi Saopha territory before Myanmar's independence from the British. Population A typical ethnic Chinese house in Theinni, Northern Shan State The ethnic groups found in Theinni comprise predominantly Shan and Jinghpaw, but there are many Chinese, Burmese, Lisu, Lahu, Wa, Palaung and Yanglam. Geography The northern part of North Theinni is a mass of hills affected by the geological fault which has produced the rift that forms the Nam Tu or Myitnge valley, and has thrown up a series of parallel ranges which extend northwards to the Shweli River (Lung Kiang), without altogether destroying the north and south trend which is the characteristic of the Shan hills as a whole. In the valleys between these hills are numerous tracts under rice cultivation, some circular or oval, some mere ribands along the river banks. The southern portion has much more flat land, along the, line of the Nam Tu, its tributaries the Nam Yao and the Nam Nim, and the Nam Yek flowing into the Salween. This was formerly densely populated, and still remains the most valuable portion of the state. A range running westwards from the Salween, and marking the southern border of the rift in the hills, divides North from South Theinni. Both north and south of the Nam Tu there are many peaks which rise to , and several over . The northern portion is almost consistent enough in its altitude of about to be called a plateau. It has large, grassy, upland downs. This part of the state has fallen almost entirely into the hands of the Kachins. The Shans are found in the Nam Mao (Shweli or Lung Kiang) valley, and in the Nam Tu and other valleys in the southern part of the state. The line of the Nam Mao is the lowest portion of North Theinni, being little over above sea-level. The southern valleys are about more than ft or higher. South Theinni is practically bisected by the huge mass of Loi Ling, nearly above sea-level, and by the spurs which that peak sends north and south. Apart from this it consists of broken hill-country of no great height, or open rolling downs, the latter chiefly in the eastern half of the state. It is watered by numerous streams, of which the chief is the Nam Pang, an affluent of the Salween. =Rivers= The chief river in the northern state, apart from the Salween, is the Nam Tu or Myitnge, which rises on the Irrawaddy- Salween watershed, not far from the latter, and flows westwards through the state into Taungbaing or Thibaw, and eventually into the Irrawaddy at Amarapura. The Nam Mao or Shweli only skirts the state, but it receives a considerable tributary, the Nam Paw, which has its entire course in Theinni territory, and is large enough to be barely fordable in the dry weather, and only passable by boats in the rains. The deforestation caused by years of upland cultivation has dried up many of the springs, but as a whole North Theinni is very well watered. Considerable deposits of coal, or rather of lignite, exist in both North and South Theinni, but do not appear to be of high quality. Gold is washed in many of the streams in a fitful way. Limestone exists in large quantities. No valuable timber exists to any considerable extent. =Vegetation= There is some teak in the Nam Yao valley, and scattered wood-oil trees exist. Pine forests cover some of the ranges, but, as elsewhere in the Shan states, varieties of the oak and chestnut are the commonest forest trees. =Climate= The climate of the state as a whole is temperate. In the plains of the uplands there are yearly frosts in January, February and March, but in the greater part of the state the thermometer rarely falls to freezing-point, and in the hot weather does not exceed ninety degrees for any length of time. The average rainfall seems to be about yearly.

The Ski-Doo personal snowmobile brand is so iconic, especially in Canada, that it was listed in 17th place on the CBC's The Greatest Canadian Invention list in 2007. Ski-Doo also has its own range of snowmobile suits. History The first ever Ski-Doo was launched in 1959. It was a new invention of Joseph Armand Bombardier. The original name was Ski-Dog, NY but a typographical error in a Bombardier brochure changed the name Ski-Dog to Ski-Doo. The first Ski- Doos found customers with missionaries, trappers, prospectors, land surveyors and others who need to travel in snowy, remote areas. The largest success for the snowmobile came from sport enthusiasts, a market that opened the door to massive production of snowmobiles. This popularity led to skidoo (sometimes ski-doo), with the derived verb skidooing (or ski-dooing), becoming the traditional generic term for snowmobile in much of Canada. In early 2016 Ski- Doo announced that they are releasing an all new snowmobile engine and chassis. Most of the 2 stroke engines from Ski-Doo as well as its competitors mainly featured 800cc motors (for the newer snowmobiles). Ski-Doo announced that in its new line of model year 2017 snowmobiles, they would have an 850cc motor. That motor (the Rotax 850 E-Tec) was designed with an all new chassis, not designed separately. The new motor and chassis makes the snowmobile more agile, responsive and powerful. Ski-Doo named this new chassis/motor combination \\"Gen-4\\" and released it in several different models (Summit, MXZ, and Renegade).

There are currently six member institutes: Panos Caribbean, Panos Europe, Panos West Africa, Panos Eastern Africa, Panos Southern Africa and Panos South Asia. The member institutes participate in a global network, through which they work on common themes. Globally and regionally, Panos Network works with media and other information actors to enable developing countries to shape and communicate their own development agendas through informed public debate. They particularly focus on amplifying the voices of poor and marginalised people.Panos Network mission statement The name Panos may have some connection with the ancient Greek word phanos (œÜŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ), which means torch. Influences may also be found from the Nepali word panas, which is a lamp lit when people gather round to discuss important issues. Origins The first institute, based in London, was founded in 1986 by journalist Jon Tinker. Tinker had been working with the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), where he ran the Earthscan programme, focused on providing unbiased, scientific data to journalists covering environmental issues. Tinker identified the need to develop resources helpful in providing information and data on a range of issues that directly affect the most marginalized voices in the developing world, to help those voices be heard, and help bridge the communications' divide. The organisation's first major project was for Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), producing studies on the sustainability of Nordic aid programmes, written by journalists based in the recipient countries. Panos subsequently followed that method, having reports written by people from the developing world. Jon Tinker described this as, \\"Providing authentic Southern voices on Southern issues\\".Tinker, Jon (2002), \\"Earthscan-Panos\\", Evidence for Hope, IIED, p.10 Since its inception, Panos has run a number of programmes relating to issues affecting developing countries. These include an environment programme, a media development programme, an AIDS/HIV programme and an oral testimony programme. It was one of the first non-governmental organisations to highlight HIV/AIDS as a development issue, producing a dossier in 1986 entitled AIDS and the Third World. Panos Pictures, a photo agency, was founded and partly owned by Panos London. Panos London ceased its activities in 2013.  Panos Institute Southern Africa  The Panos Institute Southern Africa (PSAf) is a regional communication for development non- governmental organization (NGO), with offices in Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa. PSAf promotes informed and inclusive participation of marginalised people in public and policy debates and decision-making processes that affect their lives. As a regional NGO, the vision of PSAf is to \\"empower the poor and marginalized to drive their development agenda, by ensuring that information is effectively used to foster development, by empowering communities to shape their own agenda\\". The focus is on amplifying the voices of the poor and marginalized, to ensure that their voices have influence in the development arena by stimulating informed debate, mainly through the media and ICTs. PSAf's work focuses on the following: * Media Development and ICTs * Heath and Development * Governance and Development * Environment and Natural Resources Management * Cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender and vulnerable groups are mainstreamed in all of PSAf's programme areas.

Components are plug-in code modules that are linked to produce an information flow. New components can be added and reused. Beyond simulation, Joone also has to some extent multi-platform deployment capabilities. Joone has a GUI Editor to graphically create and test any neural network, and a distributed training environment that allows for neural networks to be trained on multiple remote machines. Comparison As of 2010, Joone, Encog and Neuroph are the major free component based neural network development environment available for the Java platform. Unlike the two other (commercial) systems that are in existence, Synapse and NeuroSolutions, it is written in Java and has direct cross-platform support. A limited number of components exist and the graphical development environment is rudimentary so it has significantly fewer features than its commercial counterparts. Joone can be considered to be more of a neural network framework than a full integrated development environment. Unlike its commercial counterparts, it has a strong focus on code-based development of neural networks rather than visual construction. While in theory Joone can be used to construct a wider array of adaptive systems (including those with non-adaptive elements), its focus is on backpropagation based neural networks.

Initially 65 locomotives strong, the series was widely used on the whole French 25 kV network before losing services to TGV trains when the LGV Est went into service in 2007. History In the mid-1960s, SNCF sought a new type of dual-current electric locomotives. As thyristor technology advanced rapidly, SNCF decided to adopt the new technology for a new series of locomotives, later known as the \\"Nez Cass√©s (Broken Noses, due to their cab styling by Paul Arzens)\\" or \\"BB 4400kW\\". Given that the need for pure AC-locomotives was greatest, SNCF placed an initial order of five locomotives in 1968. In 1969 a second order of 10 locomotives followed, in 1970 a third order was made for another 10 locomotives. The remaining 40 locomotives were ordered in 1973. The first five locomotives were delivered in 1971 in the overall-green \\"Maurienne\\" livery. The rest followed between 1973 and 1978, painted in the striking TEE-Arzens livery. Initially meant to support BB16000 locomotives on eastern and northeastern lines, which could not keep up with the timetables anymore after top speed on some sections was raised to , the BB15000 series would become the most important locomotives on the northern and northeast network. Career =1970s-2007= After being tested on the Paris‚Äì√âpernay main line in 1971, they went into commercial service from 1972. They ran mostly on the northeastern network where they pulled nearly all the passenger trains, including the famous national TEE trains Kl√©ber and Stanislas. Some services extended to the northwest, with workings to Lille, Calais and the Belgian border at Qu√©vy. Services remained stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but the opening of the Ligne-a-Grande- Vitesse Nord in 1993 started a cascade of assignments in which the BB15000's lost services to either dual-voltage BB26000 locomotives or to TGV trains. Yet BB15000 locomotives remained strong in the northeast and pulled strongly- promoted Corail T√©oz services between Paris and Strasbourg from 2003 until mid-2005, when half of the loco-hauled services were converted to TGV trainsets, albeit still running on the classic line. In mid-2006 the remainder were also converted into TGV services, leaving only some TER trains for the Lorraine and Alsace regions, and the EuroCity trains between Basel and Brussels (loco change at Luxemburg) or Paris and Frankfurt (loco change at Strasbourg). The partial opening of the LGV Est in June 2007 meant the end of classic locomotive-hauled Intercity trains between Paris and the northeastern regions, with BB15000 locomotives losing a great deal of importance there. =2007-present= Although the end of locomotive-hauled Intercity trains in the northeast marked a downgrading of duties, it did not result in the withdrawal of the class. The remaining 60 locomotives are divided over the following three sectors: * Twelve locomotives were allocated to SNCF-VFE and worked Basel-Luxembourg EuroCity services, as well as DB AutoZug's night train from Paris-Nord to the Belgian border. These locomotives are fitted with the Memor II+ safety system which enables them to operate in Luxembourg. These locomotives are numbered in the 115000 series. This Basel-Luxembourg EuroCity service ended during the summer of 2016 and the locomotives assigned to it were reassigned at that time. * Twenty-eight locomotives are allocated to SNCF-CIC (Corail Intercit√©) and are working medium to long distance regional services between Paris and Amiens/Maubeuge on the one end, and Paris- Caen/Deauville/Le Havre on the other end. Twelve locomotives of this sub- series, called BB215000R (from \\"R√©versible\\"), are fitted with MUX which enables them to work in push-pull with the Corail B6Dux driving trailers and will be replacing BB216000 locomotives there. This sub-series is numbered in the 215000 series. * Twenty locomotives are allocated to SNCF-TER Champagne- Ardennes, Haute-Normandie and Picardie, working fast TER services and replacing the remaining BB516000 locomotives. Fifteen locomotives of this sub- series, called BB515000R, are fitted with MUX in able to operate in push-pull mode with V2N driving trailers on Paris-Rouen (Haute-Normandie) and Paris- Amiens (Picardie) and will be replacing BB516100 locomotives there. This sub- series is numbered in the 515000 series. Technology The locomotive's shell is shared with the other members of the \\"Nez Cass√©\\" (broken nose) family (BB7200, BB22200) and is of the monocoque type. The cabin is shared with the BB7200 and BB22200 series and have even a great deal in common with cabs of other SNCF locomotives of the 1960s. This class was also the first to introduce the VI (\\"Vitesse Impos√©e\\") cruise control system which is now standard on all SNCF locomotives delivered after 1971. The electrical part consists of a single pantograph (type AM18U) which collects 25 kV from the catenary. Power is passed through a transformer which lowers the tension to about 1500 V AC and a bridge rectifier controlled by thyristors rectify it into DC, which is then fed into the traction motors. Brake equipment consists of pneumatic, electro-pneumatic, regenerative and dynamic brakes. The monomotor bogies were derived from the Y217 bogies of BB67400 locomotives and have primary (coil springs) and secondary (\\"sandwich\\" blocs) suspension. The reliability of the locomotives is outstanding, as some locomotives have already passed the 10,000,000 km mark and have less than 2 defects per million kilometres, a number unrivaled by other similar European locomotives. Liveries BB15000 locomotives have carried at least six different liveries: Paris-Est. * The green \\"Maurienne\\" livery (so called because CC6500 locomotives also wore this livery and operated in the French Maurienne region) was worn by locomotives BB15000 - BB15005 between their delivery and 1982, when they were repainted into the TEE-Arzens livery. Paris-Est. * The TEE- Arzens livery was worn by locomotives from number BB15006 onwards by delivery; the first five green locomotives were also repainted in this livery in 1982. There were two variants of this livery: the original livery which consisted of silver, red and orange, and the modified one where the silver was replaced with opaque gray. Nowadays a number of locomotives still wear the original livery, the others having another one listed below. * The \\"b√©ton\\" (lit. concrete) livery, which was the standard livery of BB7200 and BB22200 locomotives, was tested on locomotives BB15034 and BB15040 in 1986-87 but was considered a failure as the locomotives got dirty too fast. * The \\"Multiservices\\" livery (former known as Corail+, as on the coaches) was introduced in 1995 on BB15016 and consisted of two shades of gray, silver and red. Nearly half of the class was painted in this livery by 2002, when the new \\"en voyage...\\" livery was introduced on the series. * The \\"en voyage...\\" livery was the latest livery of the class. Introduced on BB15063 in 2002. It consists of silver, purple on cab side 1 and cyan on cab side 2, and the \\"en voyage...\\" sticker with stylish motifs. The rights to use this design have expired and all locos still wearing it will be repainted in something else upon their next overhaul. * A number of BB 15000 locos have been repainted in TER liveries of the regions where they run. The version used by TER Nord-Pas de Calais (now Hauts de France) is particularly unattractive. The experimental nature of the class BB15000 locomotives were popular locomotives for conducting various experiments. A small overview: * Already in 1972 BB15001 was used for testing a potential speed raise to 200 km/h (124mph) on the Paris-Strasbourg main line (sections √âpernay - Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, Vitry-le-Fran√ßois - Bar-le-Duc and Lun√©ville - Sarrebourg). While the locomotive had no technical difficulties at those speeds, the project was not continued due to the enormous cost of the infrastructure works which had to be undertaken. * In 1973 BB15008 was used to test communication interferences on the now defunct √úberherrn-Wadgassen line in Germany, exceptionally fed with 25 kV at that time. * In 1974 BB15007 was taken out of service and transformed into BB7003, the prototype for the BB7200 locomotives. See SNCF Class BB 7003. * In 1976 BB15015 was tested on the Marseille-Nice main line in order to prepare the line for the arrival of the similar, but bicurrent BB22200 locomotives. * In 1977 BB15041 drove special demonstration rides between √âpernay and Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne at 200 km/h (124 mph) for Amtrak executives in order to convince them to buy a locomotive based on this design rather than the Swedish-based AEM-7. Eventually six-axle locomotive CC21003 was rebuilt to US standards and sent to the United States instead. * In 1978 BB15012 received the lower-geared bogies of locomotive BB22201 and was tested on various lines with heavy freight trains with weights up to , in order to test the performances against BB22000 locomotives. * In 1979 BB15063 was equipped with the bogies of BB7248 which had a modified secondary suspension for operating in the Middle East. The Iranian Railways were interested in purchasing a locomotive class based on the BB15000 design. BB15063 was tested with heavy trains up to on various 25 kV lines. BB15063 retains these special bogies even today. * In 1979 BB15030 was used for stability tests in the Marne valley region at speeds up to . * In 1980, a BB15000 locomotive pulled middle cars of a TGV Sud-Est train set at high speeds in preparation of their services on the LGV Sud-Est. * Later that year, BB15008 was sent to the Rail Tec Arsenal climatic test chamber in Vienna for thermal tests up to . * In 1981 locomotives BB15049 and BB15059 were used for testing the behaviour of the AM18U pantographs at high speeds in tunnels, related to use in the then not yet built Channel Tunnel. * In 1982 BB15055 receives synchronous motors. Later that year it is renumbered BB10004. See SNCF Class BB 10004. * Also in 1982 BB15056 received a bimotor bogie with motors similar to the ones used in TGV Sud-Est sets. * In 1983 BB7003 (original BB15007) is transformed into BB10003, a test-bed locomotive for asynchronous motors. See SNCF Class BB 10003. * In 1989 BB10004 was restored to its original configuration and taken back into service with its original number, BB15055. * In 1997 BB10003 was restored to its original configuration and taken back into service with its original number, BB15007.

Its success in the early years of professional football in both England and Scotland made Alliance the basis for a second division in both countries. The alliance attracted a number of Junior clubs to the League system to guarantee its longevity for years to come. 1891‚Äì97 Originally founded in 1891 to rival the League, the Scottish Alliance was one of a number of leagues set up a year after the Scottish Football League was formed. The original members were Airdrieonians, Ayr, East Stirlingshire, Morton F.C., Kilmarnock, King's Park, Linthouse F.C., Northern, Partick Thistle, Port Glasgow Athletic, St Bernard's F.C. and Thistle. In 1892, several clubs left and the league was reconstituted with a smaller membership. In 1893 a number of clubs returned, but during the summer, the Alliance was used as the backbone of the new Second Division of the Scottish League. The league, bolstered by the inclusion of a number of clubs from the Scottish Football Federation, continued for four more years. =Champions= Scottish Alliance (1891-1897), Scottish Football Historical Archive (archived version, 2017) *1891‚Äì92 Linthouse *1892‚Äì93 Cowlairs *1893‚Äì94 Royal Albert *1894‚Äì951894/95, Hamilton Academical Memory Bank Wishaw Thistle *1895‚Äì961895/96, Hamilton Academical Memory Bank Wishaw Thistle *1896‚Äì97 Third Lanark 'A' =Membership= *Airdrieonians 1891‚Äì94 *Albion Rovers 1893‚Äì96 *Arthurlie 1893‚Äì96 *Ayr 1891‚Äì92 *Blantyre Victoria 1895‚Äì97 *Burnbank Swifts 1895‚Äì96 *Cambuslang 1892‚Äì93, 1894‚Äì97 *Cameronians 1896‚Äì97 *Clyde 'A' 1896‚Äì97 *Cowlairs 1892‚Äì93 *Dykehead 1895‚Äì96 *East Stirlingshire 1891‚Äì92 *Hamilton Academical 1894‚Äì96 *Johnstone 1894‚Äì95 *Kilmarnock 1891‚Äì93 *King's Park 1891‚Äì92 *Linthouse 1891‚Äì93 *Morton 1891‚Äì92 *Neilston 1895‚Äì96 *Northern 1891‚Äì93, 1896‚Äì97 (resigned during the season) *Partick Thistle 1891‚Äì93 *Port Glasgow Athletic 1891‚Äì92 *Royal Albert 1893‚Äì96 *St Bernard's 1891‚Äì93 *Third Lanark 'A' 1896‚Äì97 *Thistle 1891‚Äì93 *Vale of Leven 1892‚Äì93 *Wishaw Thistle 1893‚Äì96 1905‚Äì06 The Scottish Alliance was reformed for a season in 1905‚Äì06.

In 1932-33 season they were joined by Beith, Galston and Bo'ness, who were unable to pay their opponents match guarantees.Donald Caskie, Possilpark to Ibrox: The Career of Jimmy Caskie, 1931 to 1952, Norwood publishing, 2014) From 1920, it had a policy of including at least one non-reserve team. On the collapse of the Scottish Football League Third Division in 1926, a large number of clubs found a place in the Alliance. So much so that for one season the competition was split into regional sections. This split lasted only one season, after which the Alliance was amalgamated again into one division. In 1938, the First Division clubs decided to create a formal league for reserve teams, which meant that Beith and Galston had to be expelled because they were first teams. It also meant that Dundee's reserve team were expelled; as the club had been relegated from the First Division but had still maintained a reserve team in the Alliance. =Champions= *1919‚Äì20 Kilmarock 'A' *1920‚Äì21 St Mirren 'A' *1921‚Äì22 Celtic 'A' *1922‚Äì23 Airdrieonians 'A' *1923‚Äì24 Rangers 'A' *1924‚Äì25 Heart of Midlothian 'A' *1925‚Äì26 Airdrieonians 'A' *1926‚Äì27 East ‚Äì Heart of Midlothian 'A' (Overall champions) West ‚Äì Airdrieonians 'A' *1927‚Äì28 Rangers 'A' *1928‚Äì29 Rangers 'A' *1929‚Äì30 Rangers 'A' *1930‚Äì31 Rangers 'A' *1931‚Äì32 Rangers 'A' *1932‚Äì33 Aberdeen 'A' *1933‚Äì34 Celtic 'A' *1934‚Äì35 Rangers 'A' *1935‚Äì36 Aberdeen 'A' *1936‚Äì37 Celtic 'A' *1937‚Äì38 Celtic 'A' =Membership= *Aberdeen 'A' 1920‚Äì38 *Airdrieonians 'A' 1921‚Äì34 *Albion Rovers 'A' 1920‚Äì23 *Arbroath 1920‚Äì21 *Ayr United 'A' 1919‚Äì32, 1937‚Äì38 *Beith 1926‚Äì27, 1928‚Äì38 *Bo'ness 1933‚Äì34 *Brechin City 1926‚Äì27, 1928‚Äì29 *Broxburn United 1926‚Äì27 *Celtic 'A' 1919‚Äì22, 1930‚Äì38 *Clyde 'A' 1919‚Äì21 *Clydebank 'A' 1919‚Äì20, 1921‚Äì22, 1925‚Äì26 *Cowdenbeath 'A' 1924‚Äì26, 1931‚Äì32 *Dumbarton 'A' 1921‚Äì22 *Dykehead 1926‚Äì27 *Dundee 'A' 1920‚Äì24, 1925‚Äì28, 1930‚Äì32, 1934‚Äì38 *Dundee Hibernian 1922‚Äì23 *Falkirk 'A' 1921‚Äì22, 1923‚Äì30, 1931‚Äì32, 1936‚Äì38 *Forfar Athletic 1920‚Äì21 *Galston 1932‚Äì38 *Hamilton Academical 'A' 1921‚Äì22, 1929‚Äì38 *Heart of Midlothian 'A' 1921‚Äì38 *Helensburgh 1926‚Äì27 *Hibernian 'A' 1920‚Äì22, 1925‚Äì31, 1933‚Äì38 *Johnstone 1926‚Äì27 *Kilmarnock 'A' 1919‚Äì38 *Leith Athletic 1923‚Äì24, 1926‚Äì27 *Lochgelly United 1926‚Äì27 *Mid-Annandale 1926‚Äì27 *Montrose 1926‚Äì27, 1928‚Äì29 *Morton 'A' 1920‚Äì21, 1927‚Äì28, 1930‚Äì32 *Motherwell 'A' 1919‚Äì22, 1926‚Äì38 *Nithsdale Wanderers 1928‚Äì30 *Partick Thistle 'A' 1919‚Äì38 *Peebles Rovers 1926‚Äì27 *Queen of the South 'A' 1924‚Äì27, 1933‚Äì38 *Queen's Park Strollers 1920‚Äì38 *Raith Rovers 'A' 1921‚Äì23, 1924‚Äì25, 1927‚Äì28 *Rangers 'A' 1919‚Äì38 *Royal Albert 1926‚Äì27 *St Johnstone 'A' 1925‚Äì30, 1933‚Äì38 *St Mirren 'A' 1919‚Äì24, 1925‚Äì38 *Solway Star 1926‚Äì27 *Third Lanark 'A' 1920‚Äì25, 1928‚Äì29, 1931‚Äì34, 1936‚Äì38 *Vale of Leven 1926‚Äì27 1939‚Äì40 In 1939 the Scottish Alliance was re-formed by Babcock & Wilcox, Galston, Girvan Athletic, Nithsdale Wanderers, Queen's Park Strollers, Stranraer and Vale of Leven but disbanded after only a couple of games because of World War II. 1956‚Äì57 In 1956‚Äì57, six reserve sides formed a new Alliance ‚Äì Dumbarton, St Johnstone, Clyde, Dundee United, Third Lanark, and Queen's Park Victoria XI.

Arzens was responsible for the design of French rail locomotives from the 1940s up to the 1970s. Paul Arzens: La Baleine (the whale), 1938, 3500 ccm, 160 km/h, Cit√© de l'Automobile, Mulhouse Paul Arzens: Oeuf, 125 ccm, 80 km/h, that he designed and built in 1942, a sphere of plexiglas mounted on aluminum; L'≈íuf √©lectrique (The electric egg) La Baleine, 1938 L'≈íuf √©lectrique from behind Paul Arzens (1903‚Äì1990) was a French industrial designer of railway locomotives and motor cars. Arzens was born in Paris, at an address along the on the northern side of the city. As a young man he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and soon gained recognition as a talented artist able at this stage, unusually, to live reasonably well on the sales proceeds from his paintings. This gave him enough time to pursue other interests in the realms of engineering and design. As his life progressed he accumulated a large collection of his own paintings and gained a reputation for an acute reluctance to sell any. Cars In 1935 Arzens turned his interests to automobile engineering. He designed and constructed a six-speed automatic transmission that he installed in an old Chrysler and which worked. Robert Peugeot tried the car and was impressed, although hopes that the system might be adopted for the Peugeot 402 came to nothing, possibly because Peugeot had recently signed a deal with Cotal involving their pre-selector transmission. Two years later, Arzens came up with an eye-catching and streamlined two- seater cabriolet prototype body built around the chassis of an old Buick. The car was christened \\"La Baleine\\" (the whale). With its integrated headlights, panoramic curved windscreen (of \\"plexiglas\\") and proto-ponton format styling, the design anticipated sports cars of the 1950s and 1960s. The car subsequently joined the Bugattis of the Schlumpf Collection at what has become the National Motor Museum in Mulhouse. Two years later, following the German invasion, and the virtual disappearance of petrol for civilian use, Arzens came up with a second Baleine, closely resembling the first at least from the outside, but based on the chassis of an old Fiat - much lighter than a Buick - and encumbered by 1,100 kg of accumulator batteries. This was an electric vehicle with a claimed 10 hp providing a range of more than 200 km (125 miles) at 65/70 km/h (approx 40 mph). Arzens' next automotive one-off appeared in 1942 and was instantly christened \\"L'Oeuf\\" (the egg), reflecting its egg- shape. Other eye catching features were the tiny wheels and the high proportion of the bodywork formed of curved transparent plexiglas. The body itself weighed just 60 kg, although adding the electric rear mounted motor raised this to 90 kg. Once batteries were added the vehicle weight was increased to 350 kg, allowing for a range of 100 km (63 miles) at 70 km/h (44 mph) or at 60 km/h 37 mph if two people were on board. Rail locomotives 1955 speed records for an electric locomotive stood unbroken for over 25 years. In 1947 Paul Arzens was placed on the payroll of the French National Railway Company (SNCF) and his first commission for them dates from that same year. Arzens was behind the designs of the BB and CC locomotives and their numerous derivatives which would together dominate the French railway network during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. One of his earlier designs was for the smooth fronted CC7100 series. It was one of these, the CC7107, which broke the electric train speed record in 1955. The record would stand until broken by a TGV in 1981. Arzens was also behind the reverse sloping front window characteristic of locomotives such as the BB15000, which he said had been inspired by the form of a \\"sprinter on the starting block\\".

The NVAX was a high-end single-chip VAX microprocessor. A variant of the NVAX, the NVAX+, differed in the bus interface and external cache supported, but was otherwise identical in regards to microarchitecture. The NVAX+ was designed to have the same bus as the DECchip 21064, allowing drop-in replacement. The NVAX and NVAX+ was used in late-model VAX systems released in 1991 such as the MicroVAX 3100, VAXstation 4000, VAX 4000, VAX 6000, VAX 7000/10000 and VAXft. Although Digital updated the design throughout the early 1990s, the processors and the VAX platform itself was ultimately superseded by the introduction of the DECchip 21064, an implementation of the Alpha (then Alpha AXP) architecture, and the resulting systems in November 1992. The NVAX was offered at a variety of clock speeds, 83.3 MHz (12 ns), 71 MHz (14 ns) and 62.5 MHz (16 ns), while the NVAX+ is clocked at a frequency of 90.9 MHz (11 ns). The NVAX offered about 25 VAX Unit of Performance (VUPs), while the NVAX+ was roughly 35 VUPs. This was only slightly less than the VAX 9000 mainframe's roughly 40 VUPs, but available in a desktop form factor. Description NVAX contained 1.3 million transistors on a die measuring 16.2 by 14.6 mm in size (236.52 mm¬≤). The die was fabricated in Digital's fourth- generation CMOS process, CMOS-4, a 0.75 ¬µm process with three layers of aluminium interconnect. The NVAX is packaged in a 339-pin pin grid array. The NVAX was offered at a variety of clock speeds, 83.3 MHz (12 ns), 71 MHz (14 ns) and 62.5 MHz (16 ns), while the NVAX+ is clocked at a frequency of 90.9 MHz (11 ns). The NVAX offered about 25 VAX Unit of Performance (VUPs). The NVAX+, introduced at the same time, was identical in terms of the processor design but used a different bus, cache system and its external connection was a 431-pin array. These were identical to those on the Alpha, allowing an NVAX+ machine to be upgraded to an Alpha simply by changing the CPU. These changes also allowed it to operate with slightly higher performance, and the NVAX+ ran at roughly 35 VUPs. This was only slightly less than the VAX 9000 mainframe's roughly 40 VUPs. In 1994, a variant of the NVAX+, the NVAX++ (also known as NV5) was introduced in VAX 7000 Model 7x0 and VAX 10000 Model 7x0 systems. It operated at 133 MHz (7.5 ns) and was fabricated in Digital's fifth-generation CMOS process, CMOS-5, a 0.50 ¬µm process. It improved performance to 50 VUPs. In 1996, a 170.9 MHz NV5 was introduced, used in the VAX 7000/10000 Model 8x0.  Microarchitecture  The NVAX is partitioned into the five semi-autonomous units, the I-box, E-box, F-box, M-box and C-box. The NVAX is macropipelined. Multiple VAX macroinstructions are processed in parallel by autonomous units, which have their own micropipelines. The I-box fetches and decodes VAX instructions. It also contains the 2 KB direct-mapped virtual instruction cache (VIC) and the 512-entry by 4-bit branch history table. The I-box aimed to fetch eight bytes of instruction data from the VIC during every cycle. The E-box executes most non-floating-point instructions. It is controlled by microcode from a 1,600-word control store with the capability to patch 20 words. The F-box executes floating-point instructions as well as 32-bit integer multiply instructions. It has a four-stage floating-point and integer multiply pipeline and a non-pipelined floating-point divider.

On the top the CVAX clock chip The CVAX is a microprocessor chip set developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that implemented the VAX instruction set architecture (ISA). The chip set consisted of the CVAX 78034 CPU, CFPA floating-point accelerator, CVAX clock chip, and the associated support chips, the CVAX System Support Chip (CSSC), CVAX Memory Controller (CMCTL), and CVAX Q-Bus Interface Chip (CQBIC).  CVAX 78034  The CVAX 78034, also known as the MicroVAX 78034, is a second-generation single-chip VAX microprocessor. Systems featuring the CVAX chip set became available in late 1987. It is clocked at frequencies of 12.5 MHz (80 ns) in higher-end systems such as the VAX 6000 Model 200 and at 11.11 MHz (90 ns) in lower-end systems such as the MicroVAX 3500 and 3600.Thomas F. Fox et al., \\"The CVAX 78034 Chip, a 32-bit Second-generation VAX Microprocessor\\". Digital Technical Journal, Number 7, August 1988. Digital Equipment Corporation. DEC CVAX+ 78034 CPU die shot The 78034 was the first VAX microprocessor to have internal caches, a 1 KB combined instruction and data stream cache. The cache is quite unusual as it is implemented with one-transistor DRAM, whereas the majority of microprocessors use SRAM for their internal caches. This was the first microprocessor to use one-transistor DRAM for cache. DEC chose to use DRAM for the cache to reduce the area of the cache array. The designers concluded that to implement this cache with four-transistor DRAM cells or six-transistor SRAM cells would have taken 2.4 to 3 times more area. The internal cache is located in a narrow strip along the left side of the die. An external 64 KB cache complements the 1 KB internal cache. The 78034 contains 134,000 transistors on a die measuring 9.7 by 7.4 mm (71.78 mm2). It is fabricated in DEC's first- generation CMOS process, CMOS-1, a 2.0 Œºm CMOS process with two layers of aluminium interconnect. The 78034 is packaged in an 84-pin ceramic chip carrier with a heat sink. It uses single +5 volt power supply and dissipates a maximum of 1.5 W. The microprocessor is microprogrammed and partially pipelined and consists of six major functional units, the I-Box, E-Box, M-box, bus interface unit (BIU), cache, and control store and microsequencer. The I-Box fetches VAX instructions from the cache and decodes them (parses) into macroinstructions. The I-Box has an IROM (Instruction decode ROM) that holds the information required to do so. The E-Box consists of a register file, a 32-bit program counter, a constant generator, a shifter and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The register file contains 31 single-read-port/single-write- port registers and eight dual-read-port/single-write port registers. The ALU is 32-bit and is capable of executing addition, subtraction and logic instructions. Although the E-Box contains a dedicated shifter, the ALU also features a shifter, a less powerful one, for the purpose of executing integer multiply and divide instructions. The design of the register file permits these execution units to achieve higher performance by permitting more instances of simultaneous access to the registers. The M-Box is the memory management unit. It has a 28-entry fully associative translation look-aside buffer (TLB) to translate virtual addresses into physical address. In addition to the TLB, it has registers that determine the memory address to read or write to. The M-Box works closely with the BIU, which controls access to the internal cache and interfaces the microprocessor to the 32-bit address data multiplexed external bus. The control store and microsequencer provides the means of controls of the operation of the other functional units with microcode. The control store has a ROM containing 1,600 41-bit words. Each 41-bit word is divided into two, a 28-bit field that controls the functional units, and a 13-bit field that controls the microsequencer. Unlike the MicroVAX 78032, which uses X-shaped cells, the 78034 uses conventional H-shaped cells. The microsequencer's purpose is to supply microaddresses to the control store.  CFPA  The CFPA (CVAX Floating Point Accelerator) is a floating point coprocessor for the CVAX 78034. The CFPA contains 65,000 transistors on a die measuring 7.3 by 9.1 mm (66.43 mm2). It is fabricated in DEC's first-generation CMOS process, CMOS-1, a 2.0 Œºm process with two layers of aluminium interconnect. It is packaged in a 68-pin surface mountable chip carrier.

The original design team shrunk the CVAX 78034, CFPA and CMCTL, with the other chips left unchanged. The shrunk 78034 was known as the CVAX-60, which taped out in August 1987, before the original 78034 begun volume production, and the CFPA-60 taped out in November 1987. The CVAX+ operated at 16.67 MHz, but power requirements was unchanged. The CVAX+ started to ship in late 1988, as upgrades to all entry-level CVAX-based systems and were also provided as an upgrade to the VAX 6000 when the introduction of Rigel was delayed by yield issues. = SOC = DEC CVAX SOC CPU die shot SOC referred to a microprocessor which contained the CVAX 78034, CFPA, clock chip, and an 8 KB second level cache on a single die.

They play their home fixtures at the TCA Ground on the Queens Domain, in Hobart and from 2014, the club has been a member of the Southern Football League after voting to withdraw from the Tasmanian State League at the end of the 2013 season after five seasons in that competition.  History  The Hobart Football Club was formed at a meeting at The Continental in Hobart on 19 December 1944 and became a playing member of the Tasmanian Football League (TFL) in 1945 as a direct continuation of the former Cananore Football Club which participated in the TFL from 1908-1941. The club was a playing member of the TFL from 1945-1997 when it had its license cancelled by the TFL due its perilous financial position and ongoing poor onfield performances. Hobart's finest era was from 1947-1966 when they made the finals in all bar three years, earned five minor premierships and took out six TFL premiership titles in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1960, 1963 and 1966 and the 1959 State Premiership from ten grand final appearances during that era. From 1967-1985 Hobart would find success rare, taking out an incredible win in the 1973 decider against the previously unbeaten Sandy Bay and the 1980 Winfield Statewide Cup and TFL premiership in the same season, between 1967-1985 the club finished last on eleven occasions, second last on two other occasions. In 1986 the TFL switched to a new Statewide format and this seemed to reinvigorate the club with strong recruiting and good junior players coming through the system, the Tigers were to enter another strong period in their history under legendary coaches Peter Hudson (1986-1987) and Mark Browning (1988-1992), the Tigers participated in six finals series in seven years and participated in three grand finals and earned its last major premiership title in 1990 over North Launceston. After losing the 1992 TFL Grand Final to North Hobart, Hobart would never again be a dominant force in Tasmanian football, the resignation of coach Mark Browning after the season ended saw the club have four senior coaches in twelve months and eventually Hobart were to announce in 1994 that they were servicing debts of $450,000 as the Tigers very future looked to be spiralling out of control. After five consecutive poor seasons and with continuous financial losses and poor attendances and an exodus of forty players from the club, the TFL discontinued Hobart's playing licence in 1997 to participate in the competition after that season and attempted to force the club into a three-way merger with Sandy Bay and North Hobart which ultimately failed to materialise. Hobart's final TFL match was on 23 August 1997 at North Hobart Oval when they were defeated by North Hobart by 48 points. The Tigers' participated in 1,002 TFL games (441-552-9) as well as 15 extra matches (9-5-1) involving either Tasmanian State Grand Finals, State Preliminary Finals or matches in the 1980 Winfield Statewide Cup, giving the club a total of 1,017 all-time matches at the completion of their stint as a TFL club. In 1998 Hobart were given approval to join the relatively new Southern Football League, a competition formed only two years earlier involving clubs from the defunct Southern Amateurs and Huon Football Association. As a prerequisite of entering the competition Hobart were required to cease using their Tigers emblem and black and gold playing uniform, instead opting to wear a predominantly Old Gold strip with black numbers and simple \\"HFC\\" emblem on the chest. After an initially tough start in their first season winning only four matches, Hobart were to sign former premiership player Steven Gillbee as playing coach and with a return of many former players in 1999, this would herald a return of the club as a power. Hobart went on to record minor premierships in 1999 and 2000, winning their first, and to date, only SFL premiership in 1999 along with eight finals series appearances from 1999-2008 under Steven Gillbee, Michael McGregor, Andrew Lamprill and Todd Lewis but premiership success would continuously elude them. After a fractious decision by the club to adopt the Brisbane Lions emblem, colours and playing strip for four seasons from 2005-2008, Hobart were accepted to join the new Tasmanian State League from 2009-2013 and began playing in their traditional Tigers playing strip once again but success was to elude Hobart both on and off the field in the TSL, with continuous financial losses, lack of on-field success and an AFL Tasmania decision to force a merger between them and North Hobart as a new Hobart City club, Hobart Football Club voted to withdraw from the TSL at the end of the 2013 season, the Tigers final match in the top tier of Tasmanian football saw them suffer a 35 point loss to Glenorchy in August 2013 at the TCA Ground. As a result of the Tigers resignation from the TSL and return to the SFL the club lost almost its entire playing list to other TSL clubs. With the SFL also banning the club from recruiting other players from within the SFL during their first season it resulted in a player shortage which almost sent them into extinction. After two difficult seasons returning to SFL level Hobart were able to rebound in 2016 and make their first finals appearance since 2008, attempting to win their first finals match since 26 August 2006, but were defeated by New Norfolk by 38 points in the Elimination Final at Boyer Oval, however that finals appearance proved to be a false dawn as the Tigers once again sank to the lower reaches of the SFL standings and suffered a winless 2019 season. The club has had somewhat of a nomadic existence throughout its long history having played on three home grounds at various stages. Hobart began playing at the North Hobart Oval from 1945, moving to the TCA Ground part way through the 1946 season until it moved back to North Hobart in 1955 owing to a major disagreement with the Hobart Greyhound Racing Club (the TCA Ground's more financial and dominant shareholder) over exorbitant rent costs and did not return until 1961. From 1961-1982 Hobart played the vast majority of its home matches back at the TCA Ground until the TFL's ground rationalisation plans of the early 1980s saw the club forced to relocate from a by-then sub-standard facility to Glenorchy's KGV Football Park for the start of the 1983 season and they would stay there until late in the 1986 season when the club made moves to resume playing matches at North Hobart in an effort to improve flagging attendance figures (Hobart's 1985 home attendances at KGV were the club's lowest since 1945). From the latter part of 1986 until the Tigers' final match in TFL football in 1997, the club resumed playing its home matches at North Hobart again, with the exception of four specially staged home matches back at the TCA Ground in 1995 and 1996 against North Hobart, Sandy Bay, Launceston and finally South Launceston in order to raise urgent funds for the then cash-strapped club. When Hobart were accepted into the SFL in 1998, the club resumed playing matches at the TCA Ground on a full-time basis and remains so to present.

At international level he represented Scotland winning nine caps over three seasons. Personal history Goodhue was born in London, Canada West in 1867 to Charles Frederic Goodhue, and was educated at London School before being sent to Scotland to study at Merchiston Castle School. He matriculated to Caius College, Cambridge in 1885, competing his BA in 1890. After leaving Cambridge, Goodhue followed a medical career beginning his training at St Thomas' Hospital. Goodhue later took a position as Assistant House physician at the Hospital for Women at Soho Square, then Clinical Assistant at Evelina Children's Hospital. By 1898 he was practicing in Watford. Goodhue enlisted into the Royal Fusiliers (23rd Sportsmen Battalion) in 1914 as a private. His profession was a physician being a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. He was sent to France in 1915. He was 48 years old when he enlisted having given his age as only 43. He was discharged as unfit for trench life due to his age (49) in 1916 with a 25% disability war pension. After the War he retired to Budleigh Salterton in Devon. Rugby career Goodhue first came to note as a rugby player when at Cambridge, playing for the Cambridge University team. He won two sporting 'Blues', both in rugby in 1885 and 1886. On leaving Cambridge he joined St. Thomas' own rugby team while studying there, and continued his connection with rugby by turning out for London Scottish. He played nine times for the Scottish national team and was also a founder member of the first Barbarians rugby team of 1890. He later captained both the Barbarians and London Scottish rugby teams during the 1890s.

Active stretching stimulates and prepares muscles for use during exercise. Active stretches not only stretch the muscles and tissues, but prepares the muscles for the action by activating and warming them up. Before describing the principles on which active stretching is based, the terms agonist and antagonist must be clarified. Agonist refers to the actively contracting muscle or muscles while their opposing muscles are termed antagonists. The neuromechanisms conceptualized by Sir Charles Sherrington (1857 - 1956), ‚Äúthe philosopher of the nervous system‚Äù, as applied to active stretching are: #Reciprocal inhibition ‚Äî While agonist muscles contract, contraction of the opposing antagonist muscles is inhibited. (Such as when alternately flexing and extending one's elbow.) #Muscle spindles ‚Äî Sensory nerve endings in muscle detect the change in length of the muscle and its rate of change. Force applied to a muscle stimulates the muscle spindles which activate protective reflexes resulting in contraction of that muscle. (Such as the knee jerk response of neurological testing procedures.) While necessary for sports and ordinary motions, this protective reaction is counterproductive for stretching, i.e., lengthening muscles. A history of active stretching #Sir Charles Sherrington conceptualized the principle of reciprocal innervation circa 1904 and demonstrated it circa 1913. #A. D. Munrow's work proposed these principles for ‚Äòactive‚Äô mobilizing exercises. 1962 #While H. A. DeVries, L. E. Holt and others wandered from this course, P. Williams (1937) utilized procedures for his flexion exercises back program. Peters and Peters (1975) further adapted Sherrington's principles into their program of ‚Äòactive stretching‚Äô, departing from the popular static stretching designed for specific sports, to address mobility of the entire body. #EMG (Electromyographic) studies by S. Blackburn and others have validated Sherrington's principle of reciprocal innervation. Audiovisual electromyography by Peters and Peters supports Sherrington's principle of reciprocal innervation (inhibition) and his description of the reaction of ‚Äòmuscle spindles‚Äô to force. These two principles are the basis of ‚Äòactive stretching‚Äô procedures. #There currently are other stretching methods utilizing ‚Äòactive‚Äô components in conjunction with force, the use of which Munrow does not concur. 6\\\\.

Overview  Many residents of this place were rehabilitated from Panambur, after the New Mangalore Port Trust ( NMPT ). \\"Katipalla\\" in local Tulu language literally means wild stream. 'Kati' means wild, 'palla' means stream. A stream originates from this place and flows downtoward towards the Krishnapura Matha and further down joining other streams. Before rehabilitation during the 1970s, the area was covered with forest infested with wild animals like tiger, hyna, fox etc. Perhaps name of this place may have derived because the wild animals used this water stream to quench their thirst. Here the population is mixed with three main religions Hindu, Muslim, & Christians. Furthermore, Krishnapura Matha is one of Ashta Mathas of Udupi founded by Dvaita philosopher Sri Madhvacharya. Some of the area (blocks) of Katipalla are even today known as Krishnapura, especially those near to Krishnapura matha. The Krishnapura Matha has a Mukhyaprana (Maruti or Hanuman) temple inside. The structure of the Matha is supported by wood pillars. The Matha has exquisite wooden carving. The Mangalore petroleum refinery (MRPL) and BASF plant are also nearby.

He was the subject of Alexander Luria's case study The Mind of a Mnemonist (1968). Studies Shereshevsky participated in many behavioral studies, most of them carried out by the neuropsychologist Alexander Luria over a thirty-year time span. He met Luria after an anecdotal event in which he was told off for not taking any notes while attending a work meeting in the mid-1920s.The Mystery of S., the Man with an Impossible Memory. The New Yorker, August 12, 2017. To the astonishment of everyone there (and to his own astonishment in realizing that others could apparently not do so), he could recall the speech word for word. Along the years Shereshevsky was asked to memorize complex mathematical formulas, huge matrices and even poems in foreign languages he did not master, and did so in a matter of minutes. On the basis of his studies, Luria diagnosed in Shereshevsky an extremely strong version of synaesthesia, fivefold synaesthesia, in which the stimulation of one of his senses produced a reaction in every other. For example, if Shereshevsky heard a musical tone played he would immediately see a colour, touch would trigger a taste sensation, and so on for each of the senses. The images that his synaesthesia produced usually aided him in memorizing. For example, when thinking about numbers he reported: > Take the number 1. This is a proud, well-built man; 2 is a high-spirited > woman; 3 a gloomy person; 6 a man with a swollen foot; 7 a man with a > moustache; 8 a very stout woman‚Äîa sack within a sack. As for the number 87, > what I see is a fat woman and a man twirling his moustache. The above list of images for digits is consistent with a form of synesthesia (or ideasthesia) known as ordinal linguistic personification but is also related to a well-known mnemonic technique called the number shape system where the mnemonist creates images that physically resemble the digits. Luria did not clearly distinguish between whatever natural ability Shereshevsky might have had and mnemonic techniques like the method of loci and number shapes that \\"S\\" described. Problems Shereshevsky had an active imagination, which helped him generate useful mnemonics. He claimed that his condition often produced unnecessary and distracting images or feelings. He had trouble memorizing information whose intended meaning differed from its literal one, as well as trouble recognizing faces, which he saw as \\"very changeable\\". He also occasionally had problems reading, because the written words evoked distracting sensations. Things were far worse when he, for example, ate while reading. An example of the difficulties he faced in daily life: > One time I went to buy some ice cream ... I walked over to the vendor and > asked her what kind of ice cream she had. 'Fruit ice cream,' she said. But > she answered in such a tone that a whole pile of coals, of black cinders, > came bursting out of her mouth, and I couldn't bring myself to buy any ice > cream after she had answered in that way ... His memories were so strong that he could recall them after many years. After he discovered his own abilities, he performed as a mnemonist; but this created confusion in his mind. He went as far as writing things down on paper and burning it, so that he could see the words in cinders, in a desperate attempt to forget them, though some mnemonists have speculated that this could have been a mentalist's technique for writing things down to later commit to long- term memory. Reportedly, in his late years, he realized that he could forget facts with just a conscious desire to remove them from his memory, although Luria did not test this directly. In summary, his astounding memory has been taken as example of how the development of a skill can affect others. In culture The film Away with Words by Christopher Doyle was largely inspired by Luria's descriptions of Shereshevskii's life. A BBC radio play The Memory Man by Robert Ferguson was based on Luria's book Mind of a Mnemonist. \\"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling\\" by Ted Chiang mentions Solomon Shereshevsky's remarkable memory.

(His employers argue that he took a buyout early in the company's history instead of retaining his partnership stake.) Embittered and insulted, he seeks revenge and develops a system in which ordinary bats are enlarged to massive size, training them to be drawn to a new, pungent aftershave he is testing. He cleverly distributes the lotion to his enemies as a \\"test\\" product. Once they have applied the lotion, the chemist then releases his Devil Bats in the night, targeting the families of his employer's owners. The bats succeed in attacking and killing one of the owners and two of his sons. A hot shot reporter from the Chicago Register, Johnny Layton (Dave O'Brien) gets assigned by his editor (Arthur Q. Bryan) to cover and help solve the murders. He and his bumbling photographer \\"One-Shot\\" McGuire (Donald Kerr) begin to unwind the mystery with some comic sidelights. In the climactic closing scene, Layton dumps a sample of the aftershave on Carruthers, leading the bat to attack and kill its own master. Mary, the last surviving member of her family, runs into Johnny's arms.

He developed the theory of the geodynamo, pioneered the use of seismology to study the sea floor, measured geothermal heat flow through the ocean crust, and found new evidence for the theory of continental drift. Early life Bullard was born into a wealthy brewing family in Norwich, England. He was educated at Norwich School and later studied Natural Sciences at Clare College, Cambridge.Reflections on Churchill's scientists ‚Äì the first generation He studied under Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory of University of Cambridge and in the 1930s he received his PhD degree as a nuclear physicist. As it was the Great Depression and he was married he had to find a career to survive on. In the 1930s nuclear physics did not seem to be it so he switched to geophysics. During World War II he was an experimental officer at HMS Vernon, and worked on the development of degaussing techniques to protect shipping from magnetic mines. Career Bullard held a chair at the University of Toronto from 1948 to 1950 and was head of the National Physical Laboratory between 1950 and 1955. He was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours List. He returned to Cambridge in 1955, first as an assistant in research, then as a Reader and finally to a chair created for him in 1964. He was a founding fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge Bullard became one of the most important geophysicists of his day. He also did studies of the ocean floor, even though he suffered from seasickness and could rarely take scientific trips on the ocean. He was important to dynamo theory, hence his most important work concerned the source of the Earth's magnetic field. He was often frustrated by efforts to increase geophysical interest at the University of Cambridge. In his career he won the Hughes Medal, the Vetlesen Prize and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1965, he was awarded the Alexander Agassiz Medal from the National Academy of Sciences for his significant investigations of the earth from its surface to its core. Then during the early 1960s Bullard and his associates used a computer to try to fit all of the continents together. Instead of using the shorelines, as other geophysicists had done, he used a depth of 914 meters (3000 ft) below sea level. This depth corresponds to about halfway between the shoreline and the ocean basins and represents the true edge of the continents. By doing this he discovered a near perfect fit among the continents put together. With this discovery he helped further the idea of a supercontinent that an earlier geophysicist, Alfred Wegener, had suggested calling Pangaea. It turned out a posteriori that a very similar result had been published thirty years earlier by the French geologist Boris Choubert, but this work published in French in a francophone journal of low international influence had remained virtually unknown. After retiring from Cambridge he settled to a position at the University of California, San Diego. Bullard died in La Jolla, California 1980. His papers are held by the Churchill Archives Centre.

He was the son of the Hon. George Dalrymple, brother of John Dalrymple, 5th Earl of Stair. Father of John Dalrymple, 7th Earl of Stair. Life William Dalrymple (Agamemnon a great general - Taken on the Steyne at Brighton) 1804 He was educated at Glasgow University 1749. In 1752 he joined the British Army, becoming an ensign in the 52nd Regiment of Foot. He became a lieutenant in 1759 and a captain (in the 91st Regiment of Foot) from 1760. By 1762 he was a major, and served in the campaign against the Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762). After a period on half pay in 1763, he was appointed to the 14th Regiment of Foot in 1764. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1765. Between 1766 and 1768, Dalrymple was in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1768, he was placed in command of a detachment of two regiments sent to Boston, Massachusetts, to support embattled royal officials who were having trouble enforcing the unpopular Townshend Acts. Troops in his command (although he was not directly involved) were involved in the Boston Massacre, in which five civilians were killed when those troops fired into a crowd. Amid continuing hostility, Dalrymple acceded to the request of Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson to remove his troops to Castle William, an island fortress in Boston harbour. In 1772-1773 Dalrymple received a local promotion to major general and commanded a force which captured the West Indian island of St Vincent. He returned to Britain in 1773. He continued to be in touch with his American Loyalist friends in Boston. He was saddened but not surprised by the Boston Tea Party. After the American War of Independence broke out in 1775, Dalrymple returned to North America. He served as quartermaster general 1779-1783. He was promoted to brigadier general (1779) and then major general (1782). After the end of the war Dalrymple was attacked for alleged corruption, but General William Howe stoutly defended his former subordinate and the allegations were dropped. Dalrymple then went into politics. He represented Wigtown Burghs in the British House of Commons from 1784 to 1790. Between 1796 and 1798 he sat for Duleek in the Irish House of Commons. Dalrymple was promoted to lieutenant general 1793 and general 1798. Lt. Governor of Royal Hospital Chelsea 22 Mar 1798 to 2 Apr 1804; and 19 Oct. 1804 to his death. He was Colonel of the 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot from 1794 to his death.

Slip occurs by the passage of dislocations on close packed planes which are planes containing the greatest number of atoms per area and in close-packed directions (most atoms per length). Close-packed planes are known as slip or glide planes. A slip system describes the set of symmetrically identical slip planes and associated family of slip directions for which dislocation motion can easily occur and lead to plastic deformation. The magnitude and direction of slip are represented by the Burgers vector. An external force makes parts of the crystal lattice glide along each other, changing the material's geometry. A critical resolved shear stress is required to initiate a slip., Hull D., Bacon, D.J (2001); \\"Introduction to Dislocations\\", 4th ed., Slip systems =Face centered cubic crystals= 194x194px 153x153px Slip in face centered cubic (fcc) crystals occurs along the close packed plane. Specifically, the slip plane is of type {111}, and the direction is of type <10>. In the diagram on the right, the specific plane and direction are (111) and [10], respectively. Given the permutations of the slip plane types and direction types, fcc crystals have 12 slip systems . In the fcc lattice, the norm of the Burgers vector, b, can be calculated using the following equation:Van Vliet, Krystyn J. (2006); \\"3.032 Mechanical Behavior of Materials\\" :b= \\\\frac {a}{2}\\\\langle 110\\\\rangle= \\\\frac{a\\\\sqrt 2}{2} Where a is the lattice constant of the unit cell. =Body centered cubic crystals= 197x197px 181x181px Slip in body-centered cubic (bcc) crystals occurs along the plane of shortest Burgers vector as well; however, unlike fcc, there are no truly close-packed planes in the bcc crystal structure. Thus, a slip system in bcc requires heat to activate. Some bcc materials (e.g. Œ±-Fe) can contain up to 48 slip systems. There are six slip planes of type {110}, each with two <111> directions (12 systems). There are 24 {123} and 12 {112} planes each with one <111> direction (36 systems, for a total of 48). Although the number of possible slip systems is much higher in bcc crystals than fcc crystals, the ductility is not necessarily higher due to increased lattice friction stresses. While the {123} and {112} planes are not exactly identical in activation energy to {110}, they are so close in energy that for all intents and purposes they can be treated as identical. In the diagram on the right the specific slip plane and direction are (110) and [11], respectively. :b= \\\\frac {a}{2}\\\\langle 111\\\\rangle= \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt 3a}{2} : : =Hexagonal close packed crystals= Slip in hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals is much more limited than in bcc and fcc crystal structures. Usually, hcp crystal structures allow slip on the densely packed basal {0001} planes along the <110> directions. The activation of other slip planes depends on various parameters, e.g. the c/a ratio. Since there are only 2 independent slip systems on the basal planes, for arbitrary plastic deformation additional slip or twin systems needs to be activated. This typically requires a much higher resolved shear stress and can result in the brittle behavior of some hcp polycrystals. However, other hcp materials such as pure titanium show large amounts of ductility. Cadmium, zinc, magnesium, titanium, and beryllium have a slip plane at {0001} and a slip direction of <110>. This creates a total of three slip systems, depending on orientation. Other combinations are also possible.Callister, William D., Jr. (2007); \\"Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction\\", There are two types of dislocations in crystals that can induce slip - edge dislocations and screw dislocations. Edge dislocations have the direction of the Burgers vector perpendicular to the dislocation line, while screw dislocations have the direction of the Burgers vector parallel to the dislocation line. The type of dislocations generated largely depends on the direction of the applied stress, temperature and other factors. Screw dislocations can easily cross slip from one plane to another if the other slip plane contains the direction of the Burgers vector.

Lugosi portrays a mad scientist who injects his aging wife (played by Elizabeth Russell) with fluids from virginal young brides in order to preserve her beauty. Luana Walters as a journalist and Tristram Coffin as a small town doctor investigate and solve the disappearances of the brides. The film was later the subject of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode in 1989.  Plot  On the day of Alice Wentworth's wedding, mad scientist Dr. Lorenz sends the young bride an unusual orchid, the scent of which places the young woman in a state of suspended animation resembling death. He then spirits her body away to the basement laboratory of his isolated mansion and extracts glandular fluid from behind her ears to inject into his vain and aged wife in order to renew her youth and beauty. This is only the latest in a series of brides who appear to die at the altar and whose corpses subsequently vanish en route to the hospital or mortuary, and the police are thoroughly stymied. A young journalist, Patricia Hunter, investigates the case and discovers it involves an unusual orchid. She is directed to Lorenz, a known expert on orchids, and visits his mansion where she meets with a chilly reception from his wife. She is forced to spend the night when a storm washes out the bridge to town, and discovers horror in the cellar beneath the Lorenz mansion: a crazed old woman and her two sons, one a sadistic dwarf and the other a hulking half-wit, all of whom assist Lorenz in his activities; and a mausoleum in which he keeps the bodies of his bride-victims, not all of whom may be entirely dead yet. Also staying the night is a neighboring young doctor, who attends Countess Lorenz for other medical issues. When Patricia confides in him what she is investigating and what she has witnessed in the house, he agrees to help her. She leaves the next day for the city and, with her editor, develops a plan to trap Lorenz with a staged wedding and plenty of police protection, but he outfoxes them, chloroforming Hunter and carrying her to his laboratory to now use her bodily fluids upon his wife. However, during his escape, his dwarf-accomplice is shot and captured by the police. Back at the mansion, Lorenz is stabbed by the crazed old woman, Fagah, who holds Lorenz responsible for her sons' deaths. He strangles her, then collapses and dies. Fagah rallies weakly and stabs the Countess to death. The police, and the young doctor who has led them to the mansion, arrive and Hunter is freed.

Reception  Australian film critic Marcella Papandrea of The Super Network looked beyond the B-grade nature of The Corpse Vanishes and stated this about the film in her review \\"There are some truly memorable moments in this film, as once again Bela Lugosi gives a great performance as a mad scientist, his scenes have a sense of unease and dread.\\"  Release  = Home media = The film became available in many formats beginning on VHS in the mid 1990s, then on DVD after the year 2000 by many different studios, and most recently on Blu-ray in April, 2017 from the Retromedia Entertainment Group, Inc. Mystery Science Theater 3000 showed the movie in the fifth episode of their first season. The movie was considered so bad that when Tom Servo was questioned by Joel if there was anything positive from the movie, he short circuits. The MST3K episode is available in the collectors volume 16.  Trivia  Bela Lugosi also starred in another 1942 horror film, Bowery at Midnight. In a scene in that film outside a cinema, an advertising poster for The Corpse Vanishes outside the cinema doors features Lugosi's image and name. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Colorized publicity shot. The Corpse Vanishes was featured in episode #105 of Mystery Science Theater 3000 along with Chapter 3 of Radar Men from the Moon, a Commando Cody serial.

MST3K writer Mary Jo Pehl describes the movie as \\"nonstop boredom and yawns aplenty\\" and a \\"low-key quasi-thriller.\\" Like all the other first- season MST3K episodes, The Corpse Vanishes did not make the Top 100 list of episodes as voted upon by MST3K Season 11 Kickstarter backers.Bring Back Mystery Science Theater 3000 Update #41.

Writer Jim Vogel also took a dim view of the episode, ranking it #184 (out of 191 total MST3K episodes). \\"It's not the worst movie in the world, although it is very weird,\\" Vogel says, remarking that the low energy level from the riffers makes this an MST3K episode likely to bore the audience. The MST3K version of The Corpse Vanishes was released on July 20, 2010, by Shout!

As an inhabited locality, Neryungri is classified as a town under republic jurisdiction. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Neryungrinsky District as the Town of Neryungri. As a municipal division, the Town of Neryungri is incorporated within Neryungrinsky Municipal District as Neryungri Urban Settlement.Law #173-Z #353-III Economy The town is the center of a large coal field discovered about 1970. It is located on the Amur‚ÄìYakutsk Mainline and the Lena Highway, by rail north of Tynda. Nearby, all in the coal basin, are Berkakit: south; Serebryany Bor: east with a thermal coal power plant; Chulman: north, with the Chulman Airport; and a large open pit coal mine northwest across the Chulman River. Climate Neryungri has a subarctic climate ( K√∂ppen climate classification Dfc) with mild summers and severe winters. Precipitation is moderate, but is significantly higher in the summer than at other times of the year. The climate is extremely cold for the latitude in part due to the Siberian High bringing extremely cold polar air to the city in winters, whereas the high elevation usually prevents the heat waves seen in the lower areas of Sakha.

In the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition  In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, the term ƒÄdibuddha is often used to describe the Buddha Samantabhadra (in Nyingma), Vajradhara or Kalachakra (in the Sarma schools).Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan esotericism, page 53. There was also a tradition in India which saw Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ as the ƒÄdibuddha, as exemplified by VilƒÅsavajra's commentary to the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´nƒÅmasamgƒ´ti.Tribe, Anthony (2016). Tantric Buddhist Practice in India: VilƒÅsavajra‚Äôs commentary on the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´- nƒÅmasa·πÉgƒ´ti, p. 3. Routledge.

The Inner Kalacakratantra: A > Buddhist Tantric View of the Individual, p. 18. Oxford University Press. According to Jim Valby (translator of the Kunjed Gyalpo), in the Dzogchen tradition, Samantabhadra (\\"All-Good\\") is not a God but \\"our timeless Pure Perfect Presence beyond cause and effect.\\"Valby, Jim (2016). Ornament of the State of Samantabhadra - Commentary on the All-Creating King - Pure Perfect Presence - Great Perfection of All Phenomena. Volume One, 2nd Edition, p. 3.

Wayman further writes: > \\"Tsong-kha-pa's Mchan-'grel explains the \\"lord of body\\": displays > simultaneously innumerable materializations of body; \\"lord of speech\\": > teaches the Dharma simultaneously to boundless sentient beings each in his > own language; \\"lord of mind\\": understands all the knowable which seems > impossible. According to the 14th Dalai Lama, the ƒÄdibuddha is also seen in Mahayana Buddhism as representation of the universe, its laws and its true nature, as a source of enlightenment and karmic manifestations and a representation of the Trikaya.  In East Asian Buddhism  12th century painting of MahƒÅvairocana, Heian period, collecting in Nezu Museum In Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, and in Japanese Shingon, the ƒÄdibuddha is typically considered to be MahƒÅvairocana. In Japanese Shingon, the terms Primordial body (honji-shin) and Dharmakaya principle (riho-jin) are used to refer to the ƒÄdibuddha. It is also associated with the letter A, the first letter of the Siddham Alphabet, and is seen as the source of the universe.A. Verdu (1981) The Philosophy of Buddhism: A \\"Totalistic\\" Synthesis, p. 116.

The aim of the organization is to improve the sandwich industry by setting standards and rewarding excellent sandwich manufacturers and retailers in the annual Sammies. The BSA is run non-commercially on behalf of its members by J&M; Group, Ltd. This same group also runs various other organisations similar to the BSA such as the Pizza Pasta & Italian Food Society. Aims As the voice of the British sandwich industry, the primary aims of The British Sandwich Association are: To safeguard the integrity of the sandwich industry by setting technical standards for sandwich making and by encouraging improvement in the industry. To promote excellence and innovation in sandwich making. To provide a source of information for the industry. To promote the consumption of sandwiches. To provide a collective voice for all those involved in making, distributing and retailing sandwiches and to represent the views of the industry. Structure The association is a non-commercial organisation run on behalf of its members by Food Events & Things (FEAT) Ltd. which is commercially responsible for all the activities undertaken by the British Sandwich Association. Food Events & Things (FEAT) also runs other similar organisations, including the Pizza Pasta & Italian Food Association, The International Sandwich Association and The Caf√© Society. Management The policy body responsible for guiding the association is the Management Committee, which comprises a balanced group of full members of the association who are elected each year. In addition to the chair and vice- chair, who can come from any sector of the organisation, the committee includes up to two manufacturers, two retailers, one sandwich bar chain, two independent sandwich bar operators, two retail bakers, two caterers, two suppliers and a representative from the van sales/distribution sector. Membership Full membership of the association is open to any organisation involved in the sandwich industry ‚Äì including retailers, suppliers, sandwich bars, manufacturers etc. ‚Äì provided that they can prove that they at least match the minimum standards required by the association in its Codes of Practice. In the case of manufacturers and high risk suppliers, the association requires that its own auditor inspects the production facilities and systems of the organisation. In the case of lower risk suppliers, evidence of appropriate standards from a recognised independent source may, in some cases, suffice. Retail members of the association must have a rating under the Food Standards Agency Food Hygiene Rating Scheme of at least three. Only full members of the association are permitted to call themselves ‚ÄòMembers‚Äô or to use the BSA symbol. Those who simply want to have access to the information resources of the association, without the benefits of full membership, can become Subscribers to International Sandwich & Snack News Information Services. However, they must not call themselves members, use the BSA symbol or in any way infer or pass themselves off as Members.Love Sarnies - The BSA - Auditing, Technical Support Services & Code of Practice The association provides a wide range of technical support services to members. These include: Codes of Practice have been established for all sectors of the industry, including manufacturing, retailing and sandwich bar operation. There are also guidelines for sandwich vending and for mobile catering which have been put together with the Automatic Vending Association (AVAB) and the Mobile and Outside Catering Association (MOCA). The standards set by the BSA are now widely acknowledged as the minimums required for safe sandwich making and form part of the ‚ÄòFood Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice; Sandwich Manufacturing‚Äô produced with the Food Standards Agency and published by the Stationery Office. Technical Audits As part of its membership scheme, the association‚Äôs auditor visits sandwich manufacturers and high risk suppliers on a regular basis to ensure that they continue to comply with the BSA standards set out in its Codes of Practice. One of the features of the BSA audit is its consistency, with the same auditor visiting all manufacturers and suppliers. In the case of sandwich bars the association looks for evidence of good standards via the Food Standards Agency Food Hygiene Rating Scheme but may also seek confirmation by way of an independent report confirming compliance with the BSA standards. Consultancy, Advice and Assistance Through the association, members have access to a large resource of information and assistance. Each year hundreds of calls are made to the association from people seeking advice and help on anything from where to obtain particular products to issues relating to health and safety or VAT. In addition, the association provides full members with free access to a 24-hour legal help- line service staffed by solicitors. Technical Group As well as the provision of specific services, the association has an active Technical Group which meets regularly to discuss and consider issues affecting the industry. Any members can attend meetings of the Group.Love Sarnies - The BSA - Publications A number of sandwich industry publications are produced in association with the British Sandwich Association. These include: International Sandwich & Snack News magazine, launched in November 1990, is published six times a year. While the magazine supports the association and its members, particularly through the exclusive member index to suppliers at the back of the publication, it is independently published and does not necessarily always reflect the views of the association. International Sandwich & Snack News provides sandwich makers, retailers and others with up- to-date information and advice on everything from legislation and good practice to recipes. Copies of the magazine are free to members. Ebulletins are issued regularly to provide up-to-date information about the activities of the association and issues affecting members. The bulletins are circulated exclusively to full members of the association with the aim of giving them advance warning of events as well as information about new legislation etc. International Sandwich & Snack News Directory is published annually and provides a comprehensive list of suppliers and manufacturers to the industry.

During this time he realised the expansion of Tate‚Äôs Millbank site by creating the Clore Wing to display the work of J.M.W. Turner, uniting the collection which had been divided between the British Museum and the Tate. He instigated the creation of Tate Liverpool, which opened in May 1988. At a time when Tate‚Äôs public grant had been capped, Bowness established patrons‚Äô groups to fund the purchase of historic and contemporary work. Tate‚Äôs collection of post-war American and European art grew especially substantially during this time. Bowness also began the preparations for Tate St Ives (opened in 1993).

Schloss Beck (Beck Castle) is a Baroque castle in Bottrop, Germany, planned and built as a ‚Äúmaison de plaisance‚Äù between 1766 and 1777 by Johann Conrad Schlaun. It is currently run as an amusement park. History Although the building was designed as a palatial residence, by the end of the 18th century Beck Castle had become a distillery for schnaps. It came into the possession of the Metternich family around 1850. Despite the Second World War the castle remained intact, and in 1958 the Hibernia Mining Society bought the property. However, Hibernia was only interested in the grounds, and offered the castle building to all interested parties for free. Because of the responsibility and the expense of maintaining it, nobody wanted to acquire it until 1966, when a certain Karl Kuchenb√§cker bought it. Because of years of neglect, the castle had to be completely restored, and to provide money for the restoration Kuchenb√§cker opened it to the public. Following Kuchenb√§cker's death (on 28 December 2004), his family put the castle and amusement park up for sale. It is now a protected historical monument. The amusement park Beck Castle is very popular with people in the surrounding area, especially for children from 3 to 14 years, because this small theme park is not well known and is rarely overcrowded. For the locals, it is a place to go with the family to enjoy the peace and quiet and to let the children play safely. The park management offers Christmas parties and weddings in large public rooms, as well as nightly dances and recitations. Beck's moated castle, which is a baroque architectural monument in Westphalia, include a haunted cellar. The attractions include: * Wendy house * Bumper cars * Adventure simulator * Trampolines * Horse-drawn carriages * A diorama with 1000 moving figures in the castle * A haunted basement * Railroad * Nature studies path * Cart track * Playground * Big wheel * Swing boats * Electric race track for horses * Places for barbecues * Paddle and rowing boats * Carousel with aeroplanes * Roller coaster References External links * Schloss Beck web page Category:Amusement parks in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Bottrop Category:Palaces in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Tourist attractions in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Baroque architecture in Germany Category:Houses completed in 1777 ","title":"Schloss Beck"},{"id":"3906732","text":"Cornell Capa (born Korn√©l Friedmann; April 10, 1918 ‚Äì May 23, 2008) was a Hungarian American photographer, member of Magnum Photos, photo curator, and the younger brother of photo-journalist and war photographer Robert Capa. Graduating from Imre Mad√°ch Gymnasium in Budapest, he initially intended to study medicine, but instead joined his brother in Paris to pursue photography. Cornell was an ambitious photo enthusiast who founded the International Center of Photography in New York in 1974\\"In Memoriam: Cornell Capa\\" International Center of Photography. 16 Nov 2009 with help from Micha Bar-Am after a stint of working for both Life magazine and Magnum Photos. Life Born as Korn√©l Friedmann in Budapest, he moved, aged 18, to Paris to work with his elder brother Robert Capa, a photo-journalist. In 1937, Cornell Capa moved to New York City to work in the Life magazine darkroom. After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Capa became a Life staff photographer in 1946. The many covers that Capa shot for the magazine included portraits of television personality Jack Paar, painter Grandma Moses, and Clark Gable. In 1953 he visited Venezuela to make a photo-report of Caracas, on this trip he had the opportunity to photograph the artist Armando Rever√≥n. In May 1954, his brother Robert Capa was killed by a landmine, while covering the final years of the First Indochina War. Cornell Capa joined Magnum Photos, the photo agency co-founded by Robert, the same year. For Magnum, Cornell Capa covered the Soviet Union, Israeli Six-Day War, and American politicians. Beginning in 1967, Capa mounted a series of exhibits and books entitled The Concerned Photographer. The exhibits led to his establishment in 1974 of the International Center of Photography in New York City. Capa served for many years as the director of the Center. Capa has published several collections of his photographs including JFK for President, a series of photographs of the 1960 presidential campaign that he took for Life magazine. Capa also produced a book documenting the first 100 days of the Kennedy presidency, with fellow Magnum photographers including Henri Cartier-Bresson and Elliott Erwitt. Capa died in New York City on May 23, 2008, of natural causes at the age of 90. Works Capa's work is often considered quite eclectic, capturing moments as large of scale as wars to everyday subtle gestures of life, from the Six-Day War to children playing stick ball in the street. Capa wrote, \\"It took me some time to realize that the camera is a mere tool, capable of many uses, and at last I understood that, for me, its role, its power, and its duty are to comment, describe, provoke discussion, awaken conscience, evoke sympathy, spotlight human misery and joy which otherwise would pass unseen, un-understood and unnoticed. I have been interested in photographing the everyday life of my fellow humans and the commonplace spectacle of the world around me, and in trying to distill out of these their beauty and whatever is of permanent interest.\\" Capa, Cornell. Camera. October 1963, no. 10, pp. 3-4. Capa, for Life Magazine, was the first to publish a photo essay of the five missionaries killed by the Waodani, known as Operation Auca, in the eastern rain forest of Ecuador in 1956 that made world headlines. In 1968 Capa published a book called The Concerned Photographer. As evidenced in his work, this title sums up his approach to photojournalism. Among the many events and causes Capa documented were the oppression of the Per√≥n regime in Argentina and the subsequent revolution, Israel's Six-Day War, the plight of the Russian Orthodox Church under Soviet rule, and the education of mentally retarded children.Gefter, Philip. \\"Cornell Capa, Photographer, Is Dead at 90\\" The New York Times 24 May 2008, accessed 16 Nov 2009 He also took great interest in politics and documented the presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy, along with Kennedy's first one hundred days in office. Capa wrote forewords to several collections of his brother's photographs and was known to be protective of Robert Capa's memory and reputation. For example, when Robert Capa's famous image of a falling Spanish soldier during the Spanish Civil War was claimed to be a fake and not taken at the moment of death, Cornell Capa entered into a long battle to establish the legitimacy of the photograph, including tracking down the name of the soldier and his date of death.

He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1763 and undertook a Grand Tour in 1768. He was extremely extravagant and in 1775 his father had to pay off his debts amounting to ¬£25,000. Political career In 1774 Dashwood contested Wigtown Burghs on the interest of his brother-in-law John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway. With each candidate receiving only two of the four votes, Dashwood's opponent was initially declared the winner, but on petition the result was reversed and Dashwood was returned as Member of Parliament. He voted in support of Lord North in the 1770s. In 1779, Dashwood succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father on 10 November. He married Helen Mary Graham, daughter of John Graham of Kinross on 17 July 1780. Helen's uncles were MP's William and Robert Mayne and in 1780 he decided to stand at Canterbury which had been a Mayne seat.

It has links with the nearby University of Bristol and the Faculty of Health and Social Care at the University of the West of England, also in Bristol. The BRI is one of nine hospitals operated by the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust. It is located next to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, and Bristol Heart Institute (BHI).  History  =Early history= Plan of the first infirmary, 1742 The Bristol Royal Infirmary was founded by public subscription in 1735, making it one of the oldest infirmaries in the United Kingdom.Munro Smith, p. 6 In 1904 Sir George White, who gave Bristol its first electric tramway service and established what was to become the Bristol Aeroplane Company, saved the hospital from debts of over ¬£15,000 by increasing the number of subscribed donors and planning a fundraising carnival at Bristol Zoo.Munro Smith, p. 416 White was appointed president of the hospital in 1906. Recognising the need to modernise the hospital building to keep up with innovations in science and medicine, he established a ¬£50,000 fund for a new hospital building.Munro Smith, p. 417 This led to the construction of the Edward VII Memorial Wing which was designed by Charles Holden and completed in 1912. During the First World War, the Memorial Wing at Bristol Royal Infirmary together with Southmead Hospital were requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. Geoffrey Tovey, serologist and founder of the UK Transplant Service, worked at the hospital shortly before the Second World War. The hospital became part of the National Health Service in 1948 and was greatly extended in the 1960s. The Queen's Building extension opened in 1972, the Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, located behind the main hospital building, opened in 1971 and the adjacent Bristol Heart Institute opened in 2009. = Redevelopment = In April 2011, the trust board approved an ¬£80 million redevelopment of the hospital, consisting of a new ward block on Terrell Street behind the hospital, the refurbishment of the Queen's building, the conversion of wards in the King Edward building and the decommissioning of the Old Building. In September 2011, it was announced that Laing O'Rourke had signed a contract to redevelop the hospital and build an extension to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The redevelopment project included purpose-built medical and elderly care admissions units, a state-of-the-art intensive care unit, a surgical floor and a helipad on the roof of the Queen's Building. The redevelopment also included building a new Welcome Centre at the main entrance of the hospital and a new facade for the Queen's building, which was once voted one of the ugliest buildings in Bristol. The new facade was designed by the Spanish firm Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos. Construction began on the new hospital ward block in March 2011, with the demolition of buildings on Terrell Street. The newly completed Welcome Centre was opened to the public in December 2013. In May 2014, the helipad became fully operational and started receiving air ambulances from Bristol and the surrounding area, speeding up transfer times for patients who were being airlifted to the hospital. The HELP Appeal supported the construction of the helipad with a grant of ¬£500,000.  Bristol heart scandal  The Bristol heart scandal, which resulted in the deaths of a number of babies and young children during heart surgery (1984-1995) led to the Kennedy Report into paediatric cardiac surgical services at the hospital. The report led to greater emphasis on clinical governance within the NHS and the publication of the performance ratings of individual heart surgeons. Archives The archives of the Bristol Royal Infirmary are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 35893) (online catalogue). The School of Nursing (Ref. 38973) (online catalogue, online catalogue), records of surgery and the dispensary (Ref. 38990) (online catalogue) and records relating to the 1991 inquiry into children‚Äôs heart surgery at the infirmary (Ref. 45591) (online catalogue) are also held at Bristol Archives, as well as photographs (Ref. 40660) (online catalogue).

Cattle raising is the main occupation followed by swine, sheep and poultry raising. Cattle are sold in Formosa, Bras√≠lia, and S√£o Paulo. Most of the big cattle ranchers as well as the planters are from the south of the country. They are either Ga√∫chos or Parananeses. Almost all of the cattle raised are Nelore. They raise cattle to fatten them and then they sell them in large auctions in Formosa. Other farmers from the south have planted irrigated rice, soybeans, and corn, but Flores is still known as cattle country.

The College trains men and women for ministry in the Church of England: stipendiary, non-stipendiary, local ordained and lay ministry. Through a wide range of flexible full-time and part-time programmes. History Ripon College Cuddesdon was formed from an amalgamation in 1975 of Cuddesdon College and Ripon Hall. The name of the college, which is incorporated by royal charter, deliberately contains no comma. =Cuddesdon College= Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, founded Cuddesdon College in April 1853, as the Oxford Diocesan Seminary to train graduates from Oxford and Cambridge. Its original buildings, designed by the Diocesan Architect for Oxford G. E. Street, were built opposite the Cuddesdon Palace. The Neo-Gothic buildings are regarded as the first important design by Street and influenced much of his later work.Sherwood & Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire (Penguin Books Ltd, 1974), p.564. The College opened in June 1854 and quickly became known as Cuddesdon College. A larger chapel, built at first-floor level and with decorations by Clayton and Bell, was added by Street in 1874‚Äì5. The northwest wing, and opposite the chapel, was built in 1904, the southeast wing in 1920 and the service wing in 1925.Sherwood & Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire (Penguin Books Ltd, 1974), p. 564. Traditionally, \\"Cuddesdon\\", as it is commonly known, was in the Anglo- Catholic tradition of the Church of England. =Ripon Hall= Ripon Hall was founded in Ripon, Yorkshire, in 1897 or 1898. It was originally a hostel for theological students, known as Bishop's College, founded by William Boyd Carpenter, Bishop of Ripon. In 1902, it was merged with Lightfoot Hall, Birmingham and became known as Ripon Clergy College. In 1919, the college moved from Ripon to a site in Parks Road in Oxford and was renamed Ripon Hall. There, it became known as a liberal Anglican college. In 1933, Ripon Hall moved again, this time to a house then known as Berkeley House at Boars Hill, near Oxford, the former home of the 8th Earl of Berkeley. The college remained there until the merger with Cuddesdon in 1975, when the site, renamed Foxcombe Hall, became the regional headquarters of the Open University.\\"Seeking God ‚Äì the Story of Ripon Hall\\" in Oxfordshire Limited Edition, supplement to the Oxford Times, May 2009 =Ripon College Cuddesdon= The college incorporated the Oxford Ministry Course (OMC) in 2006 and the West of England Ministerial Training Course (WEMTC) in 2011, making it the largest provider of Anglican ordination training in the UK. The college partners the Diocese of Oxford in the delivery of Ordained Local Ministry training. In 2011 the college began a partnership with the Church Missionary Society to deliver training for Ordained Pioneer Ministers ‚Äì the first partnership of this kind that pairs a theological college with a missionary society. In 2005, the Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology (OxCEPT) was founded, which provides research and consultancy services to the wider church. In 2010 the college launched a ¬£10 million appeal to build a new education centre and chapel, as well as to raise funds for endowing bursaries, fellowships, studentships and research. The new Bishop Edward King Chapel and education centre (Harriet Monsell House) were completed and opened in 2013. The chapel ‚Äì by architect Niall McLaughlin ‚Äì has won many national and international awards for its design and building. Harriet Monsell House also included an enclosure for a community of five Anglican sisters who had moved from their base at Begbroke Priory. The sisters work alongside staff and students, supporting in prayer and spirituality, whilst continuing to develop their own ministries of spiritual direction. Ripon College Cuddesdon became internationally more active during Martyn Percy's period as principal. It works closely with the Anglican Church in Hong Kong and continues to have links with Anglican colleges in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The college developed a programme of Christian-Muslim dialogue and related work, including a Visiting Fellowship for Islamic Scholars established at Cuddesdon in partnership with the Dubai-based Al Maktoum Institute. =Present= Harriet Monsell House at Ripon College Cuddesdon Men and women with a range of previous experience, not necessarily graduates, take a two or three-year course of study incorporating pastoral and academic training. There are just over fifty full-time students taking courses of study, either as matriculated students at Oxford University or on courses accredited by Durham University through the Church of England Common Awards Scheme which began in September 2014. Prior to this time, students not wishing to study at Oxford University were able to take courses of study accredited by Oxford Brookes University. With the introduction of the Common Awards Scheme, Cuddesdon streamlined its Oxford University offerings. Where previously the college had offered three courses, the Bachelor of Theology (BTh), the Certificate in Theology (CTh) and the Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Theology, the BTh and CTh are no longer offered and Cuddesdon students wishing to study at Oxford University must now take the BA or MTh. The college also has occasional PhD students Cuddesdon students come from across the spectrum of the Church of England but it retains a liturgical approach to worship and a broad approach to theology. It maintains a regular and disciplined approach to daily prayer and seeks to train students in a modern critical approach to the Christian tradition of the Church of England. From 2008 the part-time Oxford Ministry Course, with about fifty ordinands, has been integrated into the college. The West of England Ministerial Training Course, which trains clergy and readers principally in the dioceses of Hereford and Gloucester was incorporated in 2011 and, in 2015, Portsmouth Pathway, which trains ordinands and readers in the Portsmouth diocese. The college runs a fortnightly part-time programme in theology and ministry; the Cuddesdon School of Theology and Ministry. In 2011 a new programme of training for pioneer ministers was set up in partnership with the Church Mission Society. The college also hosts a research centre for practical theology, the Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology (OxCEPT). The college is currently the headquarters of the Bloxham Project, which aims to promote Christian education in schools. It is a sponsor of the Society for the Study of Anglicanism. The current principal since 2015 is Humphrey Southern, former Bishop of Repton; the vice principal is Professor Canon Mark Chapman, Dean of College and Reader in Modern Theology at the University of Oxford. Roger Latham is Director of the Gloucester & Hereford Pathway supported by Jacqui Sewell in the Ludlow teaching centre; Susie Snyder is Director of the Part-Time Pathway; Richard Wyld is Director of the Portsmouth Pathway; Hywel Clifford teaches Old Testament and Hebrew; Sarah Brush is Lecturer in Pastoral Theology and Director of the Context Based Pathway; Rebecca Dean is Tutor for Admissions and Lecturer in New Testament; Tobias Tanton is Lecture in Doctrine; Michael Dormandy is Lecturer in New Testament; Jen Brown is Director of CSTM. Associate staff include Joanna Collicutt, Ray Gaston, Shemil Matthew, Elaine Flowers and Eddie Howells. In 2012 the college became the new home of the Sisters of the Community of St John Baptist and the Community of the Companions of Jesus the Good Shepherd as part of a major building programme to provide more teaching and residential accommodation, named after Harriet Monsell, founder of CSJB, as well as a new chapel named in honour of Bishop Edward King, sometime principal of Cuddesdon.http://www.rcc.ac.uk/downloads/Edward%20King%20Chapel%20Description.pdf Since 2011, the College has hosted the biennial international \\"Christian Congregational Music: Local and Global Perspectives\\" conference, a gathering of scholars and practitioners across disciplines to discuss issues in contemporary congregational music. Bishop Edward King Chapel Bishop Edward King ChapelThe College is home to the Bishop Edward King Chapel. Generously funded by the Sisters of the Communities of St John The Baptist and the Good Shepherd, who moved from Begbroke Priory to live in the College community. The 120 seat Chapel is elliptical in shape and its distinctive dog-tooth stone banding both complements the existing buildings in its material but remains very distinct in its form. The Chapel has a lattice-work timber frame which comprises curved laminated columns and beams to support a 13m high roof. It also features a series of clerestory windows, to the top of the walls, and floods the interior with light. The Chapel has won several awards, including: * BCIA Small Building Project of the Year award in the British Construction Industry Awards. * The structural award and the Gold Medal at the Wood Awards. * Oxford Preservation Trust Award * RIBA Award for South East On 1 February 2013, the Bishop Edward King Chapel was dedicated by John Pritchard, Bishop of Oxford, at a celebration of the Eucharist for the Feast of the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. Michael Perham, Bishop of Gloucester, preached the sermon and Colin Fletcher, Bishop of Dorchester, assisted in the solemnities.

With an area of 40 hectare (98 acres), it consists of 7 areas based on movies and TV series. Nearby the park are several film studios. History The park originally opened under the name \\"Kirchhellener M√§rchenwald\\" in 1967. M√§rchenpark was run by the German family Allek√∂tter. The park featured attractions consisting of huts in the woods where guests could press buttons to listen to different fairy tales. A couple named Hans and Ida Rosenberg bought the park after the 1976 season. They operated the park under the name \\"Traumlandpark\\". This became their second park, the first being the Tuddern safari park in T√ºddern, Germany which they purchased from Mr. L√∂ffelhardt and Mr. Schmidt, who sold the park so they could focus on their newest project, Phantasialand. In 1985, the Rosenbergs ran out of money and had to declare bankruptcy with the debt of ‚Ç¨22 million. Wolf-Dieter Jahn from Essen, Germany and Alexandre Berth√© from France, who had previously worked at the park, bought it in 1986 and reopened it in 1987 under the name \\"Neue Traumland\\". In 1989 they decided to sell the park to Bavaria Film, and it closed again on 31 August 1991. The park opened on 6 June 1992 under the name \\"Bavaria Filmpark\\". This park was originally scheduled to open in May 1991. The park closed in 1993 after not becoming very popular. In May 1994, Warner Bros. purchased the location, and began construction on \\"Warner Bros. Movie World Germany\\". The park had a grand opening on 29 June 1996 with 20,000 invited guests including Johannes Rau, Ernst L√∂chelt, August Everding, Gustava Everding, Michael Douglas, Sophia Loren, Ron Williams, Amanda Lear, David Copperfield, Claudia Schiffer, Chris O'Donnell, Hans Meiser and Heinz Hoenig as special guests. The park opened to the general public on 30 June 1996. Zeitgeist Design and Production's Ryan Harmon served as the Director of Show Development for Warner Bros. International Recreation Enterprises, where he conceived, wrote and managed the design team for Warner Bros. Movie World in Germany's worth of rides, shows and attractions. Botticelli's - Atelier der angewandten Malerei and Sanderson Group were responsible for designing and painting the theming for the park. Alan Griffith Architect and Alder Constructions were also involved in the park's development. At the end of 1999, Warner Bros. sold the park to Premier Parks (now Six Flags). Premier Parks continued to license the Warner Bros. Movie World name. In later years, large investments in bigger, faster, more action-packed attractions made Warner Bros. Movie World Germany no longer a crowd puller for families, but rather in the direction of teenagers and the young at heart. Families stayed away from the park, and many thrillseekers visited it. This, along with a decline in visitor numbers, resulted in Warner Bros. Movie World Germany being acquired by StarParks, a subsidiary of Palamon Capital Partners, on 3 April 2004, which led to the park reopening as \\"Movie Park Germany\\" on 19 March 2005, and having a grand opening on 24 March 2005, with the Warner Bros. theming removed from the park and replaced by newer themes from 20th Century Fox, MGM, and Nickelodeon. Later themes included Van Helsing, AMC's The Walking Dead and Star Trek by CBS. On 17 May 2010, Parques Reunidos bought the park from Palamon Capital Partners. No changes to the park's name or theming occurred.

William Adam of Blair Adam (2 August 175117 February 1839) was a Scottish advocate, barrister, politician and judge. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland (1802‚Äì1805) and as Lord Chief Commissioner of the Jury Court (1815‚Äì39). His political career was affected by his father's periodic financial problems, as sometimes the family had substantial wealth and sometimes it was in difficulties, forcing Adam to concentrate his attention on his legal practice. He rose to be Lord Lieutenant of Kinross-shire. His most important contribution to Scottish Law was probably the introduction of trial by jury on civil (non-criminal) cases. Biography The appellants' case by William Adam, 1812. William Adam was the only surviving son of Jean Ramsay and John Adam of Blairadam, architect and master mason to the Board of Ordnance in Scotland, of Maryburgh, Kinross. His uncle was the architect Robert Adam. Born in Kinross-shire, he was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh and Christ Church, Oxford. He joined Lincoln's Inn in 1769, to qualify as an English barrister. He was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1773 and was eventually called to the English bar in 1782. Adam represented a number of constituencies in Parliament. He was MP for the rotten borough of Gatton 1774‚Äì1780. He represented Wigtown Burghs 1780‚Äì1784. He was a Treasury nominee for that seat, as a supporter of Lord North. He moved to another Scottish Burgh seat Elgin Burghs 1784‚Äì1790. In 1790‚Äì1794 he sat for Ross-shire. His last Parliamentary seat was Kincardineshire, which he represented from 1806 until he became a Judge in January 1812. Adam took a very hard line on American issues in the early part of his political career. He was critical of his future political leader Lord North for being too conciliatory before the outbreak of fighting. However, after pursuing an independent course up to 25 November 1779 he then announced in the House of Commons that he was now going to support Lord North. After that he became a loyal friend and defender of North. Caricature of William Adam, by James Gillray, depicting his dual with Charles James Fox The grave of William Adam (1751‚Äì1839), Greyfriars Kirkyard Adam particularly disliked the leading opposition figure Charles James Fox. At one stage they fought a duel. He also attacked Fox verbally in Parliament. Adam was appointed to the minor political office of Treasurer of the Ordnance. He held this office twice, first between September 1780 and May 1782 and again April‚ÄìDecember 1783. On 17‚Äì18 February 1783, Adam spoke and voted against peace with the United States. After that, despite his past animosity to Charles James Fox, Adam advocated the Fox-North Coalition, as the only way to stop Lord North's party becoming politically irrelevant. Adam was active in gathering detailed information about the Scottish constituencies, to help his political associates. Thereafter Adam was less involved in politics as he developed his career at the English bar. Through his friendship with the Prince of Wales he was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland (1802‚Äì1805) and then Attorney General to the Prince (1805‚Äì1806). From 1806 to 1815 he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Cornwall, another office in the gift of the Prince. Adam was Lord Lieutenant of Kinross-shire from 1802 until his death. He became a friend of Sir Walter Scott. In 1812, he published Vitruvius Scoticus, a collection of his grandfather William Adam's architectural projects, which the elder William had first initiated in 1727.Colvin, Howard (1978) A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840, John Murray, p.56 During the Regency of the Prince of Wales, Adam received judicial office in Scotland. Between 1814 and 1819 he was a Baron of the Scottish Court of Exchequer. Adam became a member of the Privy Council on 17 March 1815. He became Lord Chief Commissioner of the Scottish jury court from 1815 until his death. In 1832-3 his home address was 31 Charlotte Square in Edinburgh. He died in Edinburgh on 17 February 1839 and was buried at Greyfriars KirkyardMonuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland, The Grampian Society, 1871 He lies in the huge family vault built for his grandfather, William Adam the architect, facing his father, John Adam. The vault lies south-west of the church, in front of the Covenanters Prison. Family On 7 May 1777, William Adam married Eleanora Elphinstone (died 4 February 1800), daughter of Charles, 10th Lord Elphinstone. They had six children: #John (4 May 17794 June 1825), civil servant of the East India Company, served as acting Governor-General of India in 1823. #Charles (6 October 178016 September 1853), Admiral in the Royal Navy, MP, #William George KC (6 December 178116 May 1839), lawyer, Accountant- General of the Court of Chancery. #Frederick (17 June 178417 August 1853), General in the British Army, Governor of Madras 1832‚Äì37. #Francis James (24 March 17918 June 1820) died of yellow fever at sea with Charles #Clementina (died 29 October 1877), married on 27 April 1807, John Anstruther-Thomson, DL, of Charleton, Fife.

This enzyme breaks down Malonyl-CoA (a fatty acid precursor and a fatty acid oxidation blocker) into Acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of this disorder typically appear in early childhood. Almost all affected children have delayed development. Additional signs and symptoms can include weak muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, diarrhea, vomiting, and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). A heart condition called cardiomyopathy, which weakens and enlarges the heart muscle, is another common feature of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Some common symptoms in Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency, such as cardiomyopathy and metabolic acidosis, are triggered by the high concentrations of Malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm. High levels of Malonyl-CoA will inhibit Œ≤-oxidation of fatty acids through deactivating the carrier of fatty acyl group, CPT1, and thus, blocking fatty acids from going into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation. A research conducted in Netherlands has suggested that carnitine supplements and a low fat diet may help to reduce the level of malonic acid in our body. Genetics Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is caused by mutations in the MLYCD gene, located on chromosome 16q24. The gene encodes the enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Within cells, this enzyme helps regulate the formation and breakdown of a certain group of fats called fatty acids. Many tissues, including heart muscle, use fatty acids as a major source of energy. Mutations in the MLYCD gene reduce or eliminate the function of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. A lack of this enzyme disrupts the normal balance of fatty acid formation and breakdown. As a result, fatty acids cannot be converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of this disorder, such as low blood sugar and cardiomyopathy. By-products of fatty acid processing build up in tissues, which also contributes to the signs and symptoms of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that the defective gene is located on an autosome (chromosome 16 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene - one inherited from each parent - are required to be born with the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency is extremely rare, evidence suggests that it is caused by the abnormality in the protein transcription regulation. Looking at the molecular basis, two distinct homozygous mutations are found to cause Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase deficiency in human. The first mutation is the transversion of gene from C to G causing a premature stop signal in the protein. The second mutation is a base pair insertion in the mature RNA that will eventually result in the protein truncation. A research has also confirmed that the homozygous mutation which eventually leads to MCD deficiency is caused by the isodisomy of maternal UPD. This indicates that such disease is likely to be inherited from mother‚Äôs gene profile, not from paternal source. Pathophysiology Without the enzymatic activity of Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, cellular Mal-CoA increases so dramatically that at the end it is instead broken down by an unspecific short-chain acyl-CoA hydrolase, which produces malonic acid and CoA. Malonic acid is a Krebs cycle inhibitor, preventing the cells to make ATP through oxidation. In this condition, the cells, to make ATP, are forced to increase glycolysis, which produces lactic acid as a by-product. The increase of lactic and malonic acid drastically lowers blood pH, and causes both lactic and malonic aciduria (acidic urine). This condition is very rare, as fewer than 20 cases have been reported. By 1999, only seven cases of Malonyl- CoA decarboxylase deficiency had been reported in human in Australia; however, this deficiency predominately occurs during childhood. Patients from the seven reported cases of Malonyl- CoA decarboxylase deficiency have an age range between 4 days to 13 years, and they all have the common symptom of delayed neurological development. Similar study was conducted in Netherland, and found seventeen reported cases of Malonyl- CoA decarboxylase deficiency in children age range from 8 days to 12 years. Although we have not yet gained a clear understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of this deficiency, some researchers have suggested a brain-specific interaction between Malonyl-CoA and CTP1 enzyme which may leads to unexplained symptoms of the MCD deficiency. Research has found that large amount of MCD are detached in the hypothalamus and cortex of the brain where high levels of lipogenic enzymes are found, indicating that MCD plays a role in lipid synthesis in the brain. Disturbed interaction between Malonyl-CoA and CPT1 may also contributed to abnormal brain development. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase plays an important role in the Œ≤-oxidation processes in both mitochondria and peroxisome. Some other authors have also hypothesized that it is the MCD deficiency induced inhibition of peroxisomal Œ≤-oxidation that contributes to the development delay.

Krohn Conservatory is a conservatory located in Eden Park within Cincinnati, Ohio in the United States. History The conservatory was completed in 1933, replacing smaller greenhouses that had stood in Eden Park since 1894. Originally known only as the Eden Park Greenhouse, in 1937 it was renamed in honor of Irwin M. Krohn, who served as Board of Park Commissioner from 1912 to 1948. The architect firm Rapp & Meacham designed the conservatory in the Art Deco style, in the form of a Gothic arch. A 1966 hailstorm caused extensive damage to the conservatory, and the firm of Lord & Burnham was called to restore it. The original wooden sashes were replaced with durable aluminum. Collection It contains more than 3,500 plant species from all over the world, with principal collections as follows: * Bonsai Collection - a collection of bonsai trees from the conservatory itself, the Bonsai Society of Greater Cincinnati, and private individuals. * Desert Garden - succulents and cacti including agaves, aloes, crassulas, and yuccas, as well as Cereus, Opuntia, and Pereskia. * Floral Display - home to six seasonal floral shows, with a permanent citrus tree collection of orange, kumquat, giant Ponderosa lemon, and grapefruit. * Orchid Display - approximately 75 blooming orchids at any time, from the conservatory's collection of thousands of orchids encompassing 17 genera. This display also includes a Monstera deliciosa. * Palm House - a high central house with palm trees, rubber trees, and bananas, shrubby plants, and ground cover, as well as a waterfall with a goldfish stream. Epiphytic bromeliads, orchids, and ferns grow in many of the trees. * Tropical House - a large variety of ferns, both terrestrial and epiphytic; cycad, bromeliad, and begonia collections; and important economic plants including a cacao tree, Pomegranate, vanilla vine, and dwarf banana.

Overview A Virtual ISP (VISP) purchases services from another ISP (sometimes called a wholesale ISP or similar within this context) that allow the VISP's customers to access the Internet via one or more Points of Presence (PoPs) that are owned and operated by the wholesale ISP. Virtual ISPs can vary from a normal ISP buying access points off a third party to a complete white label service where the branding of the VISP is usually such as to portray the image of being an ISP in their own right. There are various models for the delivery of Virtual ISPs. As an example a wholesale ISP could provide network access to end users via its dial-up modem PoPs or DSLAMs installed in telephone exchanges, and route, switch, and/or tunnel the end-user traffic to the VISP's network, whereupon they may route the traffic toward its destination. In another model, the wholesale ISP does not route any end-user traffic, and needs only provide AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) functions, as well as any value-add services, like email or web hosting. A complete VISP will consist of a pure rebranding of another ISP offering where the host ISP manages all aspects of the service. This model is commonly used for charities and other affinity organisations where 'MyOrganisation' ISP is actually a virtual service on another ISP. Any given ISP may use their own PoPs to deliver one service, and use a VISP model to deliver another service, or, use a combination to deliver a service in different areas. The service provided by a wholesale ISP in a VISP model is distinct from that of an upstream ISP, even though, in some cases, they may both be one and the same company. The former provides connectivity from the end-user's premises to the Internet or to the end-user's ISP, and the latter provides connectivity from the end user's ISP to all or parts of the rest of the Internet. A VISP can also be a dial-up white label service offered to anyone at no cost or for a minimal setup fee. The actual ISP providing the service generates revenue from the calls and may also share a percentage of that revenue with the owner of the VISP. All technical aspects are dealt with, leaving the owner of VISP with the task of promoting the service. This sort of service is, however, declining due to the popularity of unmetered dial-up access. History The world's first Virtual ISP was pioneered by the UK arm of the Canadian Intasys Corporation (now Ace*Comm) in partnership with Easynet. Called 'Intasys Online' the VISP was launched in London in 1996 and was used primarily as a demonstration ISP for other virtual ISPs. Intasys operated successfully as a branded ISP provider providing virtual ISPs for clients until the internet arm was sold to Zygo Productions in 1998.

He fought and was severely injured in the Battle of Bunker Hill (Breed's Hill) and also participated in battles in Elizabethtown, Brandywine, and Germantown, and was made Lieutenant-Colonel (of the 23rd Regiment of Foot) in 1778. He accompanied Cornwallis to Charleston where he was sometimes commandant. He was promoted to Major General in 1793, Colonel of both the 93rd Foot and the 39th Foot in 1794 and served in the war with France. He was elected to Parliament in 1790 as the MP for Wigtown Burghs, sitting until 1796 and again in 1797 for Arundel, sitting until 1802. He died in October 1823 in Dunbog, Scotland.

Life Xu Rong was from Xiangping County (Ë•ÑÂπ≥Á∏£), Liaodong Commandery (ÈÅºÊù±ÈÉ°), which is around present-day Liaoyang, Liaoning, but another account claimed that he was from Xuantu Commandery, which is around present-day Shenyang, Liaoning. He started his career as a subordinate of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian from 189 to 192. He held the position of a General of the Household (‰∏≠ÈÉéÂ∞á). During this time, he recommended Gongsun Du, who was from the same commandery as him, to serve as the Administrator of Liaodong Commandery. In 190, Xu Rong fought on Dong Zhuo's side against a coalition of warlords from the east of Hangu Pass. He defeated Cao Cao, who joined the coalition under Zhang Miao's banner, at the Battle of Xingyang. Later that year, he defeated Sun Jian, who joined the coalition under Yuan Shu's banner, at the Battle of Liangdong (Ê¢ÅÊù±). He also captured Li Min (ÊùéÊóª), the Administrator of Yingchuan Commandery, and killed him. In 192, after Dong Zhuo was assassinated in Chang'an, Xu Rong switched allegiance to the new central government led by Wang Yun. Wang Yun ordered him to lead troops to attack Dong Zhuo's former followers led by Li Jue and Guo Si. Xu Rong was killed in action at Xinfeng County (Êñ∞Ë±êÁ∏£; south of present-day Weinan, Shaanxi). In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Xu Rong appears as a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, after Dong Zhuo relocates the imperial capital from Luoyang to Chang'an, Cao Cao sets off in pursuit of Dong Zhuo's forces. During this time, Xu Rong intercepts Cao Cao and defeats him in an ambush. Cao Cao narrowly escapes with the help of his cousin Cao Hong.

It is a recessive disorder that is accompanied by hyperphenylalaninemia. Commonly reported symptoms are initial truncal hypotonia, subsequent appendicular hypertonia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, generalized dystonia, and marked diurnal fluctuation. Other reported clinical features include difficulty in swallowing, oculogyric crises, somnolence, irritability, hyperthermia, and seizures. Chorea, athetosis, hypersalivation, rash with eczema, and sudden death have also been reported. Patients with mild phenotypes may deteriorate if given folate antagonists such as methotrexate, which can interfere with a salvage pathway through which dihydrobiopterin is converted into tetrahydrobiopterin via dihydrofolate reductase. Treatment options include substitution with neurotransmitter precursors (levodopa, 5-hydroxytryptophan), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tetrahydrobiopterin. Response to treatment is variable and the long-term and functional outcome is unknown. To provide a basis for improving the understanding of the epidemiology, genotype/phenotype correlation and outcome of these diseases their impact on the quality of life of patients, and for evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic strategies a patient registry was established by the noncommercial International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders (iNTD). Presentation Movement disorders mentioned are caused by the inability to produce L-Dopa. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which is also involved in movement. The absence of enough of this molecule causes the movement disorders in an affected individual.  Mechanism  To understand how the absence of this enzyme affects the body, we must look at the BH4 synthesis pathway. PTPS is an intermediate in this cycle and is needed to convert 7,8 - dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydryobiopterin. 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydryobiopterin is converted into BH4 (Tetrahydrobiopterin), but since it stops at 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydrobiopterin no BH4 is made. The absence of BH4 affects the metabolism of Phenylalanine. This is the reason that PKU and PTPS deficiency share some similar symptoms. However, since BH4 is needed for much more than just the metabolism of Phenylalanine, there are other symptoms as well. This image depicts the pathway for the synthesis if tetrahydrobiopterin, a very important cofactor in the human body. = Structure and function of 6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin Synthase = PTPS is a hexamer of identical subunits. The PTPS monomer folds into a sequential four-stranded, antiparallel ùõÉ-sheet. Three PTPS monomers form a 12-stranded antiparallel ùõÉ-barrel by tight association between the N and C terminus of 2 adjacent subunits. The active enzyme complex is formed by two trimers in a head-to-head fashion. The active site is in between the trimer-trimer interface and has 3 monomers: A, A‚Ä≤, B. There are three histidine residues that form the metal-binding site in the substrate binding pocket: His 23,48 and 50. Residues Cys42, Glu133, and His89 are in close proximity to the binding pocket but are not binding it. These are thought to serve as proton donors and acceptors during catalysis. The cofactor bound can be either Mg2+ or Ni2+ (Protein Database). As previously mentioned it is involved in the biosynthesis of BH4 and catalyzes the transformation of 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate into 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase. The kinetic values for this enzyme are KM = 8.1 ŒºM and Vmax = 120 nmol/min/mg. The structure of PTPS is unique and is different than other examples of antiparallel ùõÉ-barrels. It is described as being formed by \\"a three-fold symmetrical arrangement of subunits\\". A similar ùõÉ-barrel formation has been discovered in CKS2, the difference between PTPS and CKS2 is that the formation of the latter is metal induced and reversible. The PTPS trimer is similar to a porin and is hypothesized to serve as a tunnel for dihydroneopterin triphosphate.  Diagnosis  PTPS deficiency can usually be detected by the same screening test used for PKU, because both disorders result in elevated levels of Phenylalanine. This test is known as the Guthrie test and is done on babies a few days after birth. Another diagnostic method is to measure Pteridine levels in urine and to measure neurotransmitters 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA).  Epidemiology  Taiwanese Chinese are more likely to get PTPS deficiency as the prevalence in Taiwanese Chinese is about 1/132,000 compared to white individuals at about 1/1,000,000. The image below illustrates frequency of different BH4 deficiency defects. This is suggested to be due to the Founder effect. The smaller pie charts on the side illustrate the incidence of DHPR and PTPS deficiency around the world. As can be seen PTPS deficiency occurs most commonly in Asian countries and this makes sense because of the incidence of this disease in Taiwanese Chinese being significantly higher than any other population.  History  PTPS deficiency is not necessarily its own disease. It shares history with PKU and hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) . Asbj√∏rn F√∏lling, a physician studying metabolic diseases, identified an excess of Phenylpyruvate as the cause of a strange, musty odor from the urine of two Norwegian children.FollingIA. 1934. Uber Ausscheidung von Phenylbrenztraubensaure in den Harn als Stoffwechselanomalie in Verbindung mit Inbicillitat. Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem 227:169. Further research by Penrose in 1935 lead to the coining of the term, ‚Äúphenylketonuria‚Äù. The foundations for dietary restrictions were laid down by George Jervis and Host Bickel which is still one of the best ways to treat PKU. However, this very practice of excluding Phenylalanine from the diet was not working for other forms of HPA. This was attributed to a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for PAH.Blau N, Thony B, Cotton RGH, Hyland K. 2001. Disorders of tetrahydrobiopterin and related biogenic amines. In: Scriver CR, Beaudet AL, Sly WS, Valle D, Childs B, Vogelstein B, editors. The metabolic and molecular bases of inherited disease. New York: McGraw-Hill. pp 1725‚Äì1776. The most common form of BH4 deficiency is due to PTPS. Later on PTPS was discovered and it was learned that PKU causes HPA but not all HPA is PKU.

Taint checks highlight specific security risks primarily associated with web sites which are attacked using techniques such as SQL injection or buffer overflow attack approaches. Overview The concept behind taint checking is that any variable that can be modified by an outside user (for example a variable set by a field in a web form) poses a potential security risk. If that variable is used in an expression that sets a second variable, that second variable is now also suspicious. The taint checking tool can then proceed variable by variable forming a list of variables which are potentially influenced by outside input. If any of these variables is used to execute dangerous commands (such as direct commands to a SQL database or the host computer operating system), the taint checker warns that the program is using a potentially dangerous tainted variable. The computer programmer can then redesign the program to erect a safe wall around the dangerous input. Taint checking may be viewed as a conservative approximation of the full verification of non-interference or the more general concept of secure information flow.A. Sabelfeld and A. C. Myers, \\"Language-based information-flow security\\", IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 2003. Because information flow in a system cannot be verified by examining a single execution trace of that system,J. Ligatti, L. Bauer, D. Walker. \\"Edit automata: Enforcement mechanisms for run-time security policies\\". International Journal of Information Security, 2005 the results of taint analysis will necessarily reflect approximate information regarding the information flow characteristics of the system to which it is applied.T. Terauchi and A. Aiken. \\"Secure information flow as a safety problem\\". In 12th International Static Analysis Symposium, September 2005.  Example  The following dangerous Perl code opens a large SQL injection vulnerability by not checking the value of the \`$name\` variable: #!/usr/bin/perl my $name = $cgi->param(\\"name\\"); # Get the name from the browser ... $dbh->{TaintIn} = 1; $dbh->execute(\\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '$name';\\"); # Execute an SQL query If taint checking is turned on, Perl would refuse to run the command and exit with an error message, because a tainted variable is being used in a SQL query. Without taint checking, a user could enter \`foo'; DROP TABLE users --\`, thereby running a command that deletes the entire database table. Much safer would be to encode the tainted value of $name to a SQL string literal and use the result in the SQL query, guaranteeing that no dangerous command embedded in \`$name\` will be evaluated. Another way to achieve that is to use a prepared statement to sanitize all variable input for a query. One thing to note is that Perl DBI requires one to set the \`TaintIn\` attribute of a database handle as well as enabling taint mode to check one's SQL strings. History Perl supported tainting in setuid scripts from at least version 3.0 (released in 1989), though it was not until version 5.0 (released in 1994) that the \`-T\` switch was introduced integrating tainting into a single runtime. In 1996 Netscape implemented data tainting in server-side JavaScript in Netscape Communications Server, as well as client-side for Netscape Navigator 3. However, since the client-side support was considered experimental it shipped disabled (requiring user intervention to activate), and required page authors to modify scripts to benefit from it. Other browser vendors never implemented the functionality; nor did Communications Server's primary competition, Microsoft's (then) new Internet Information Server.

Early life Lloyd Osbourne was born in San Francisco to Fanny Osbourne (n√©e Vandegrift) and Samuel Osbourne, a lieutenant on the State Governor's staff. They had married when Fanny was just seventeen years of age, and Lloyd's elder sister Isobel Osbourne (or 'Belle') was born the following year. Samuel fought in the American Civil War, went with a friend sick with tuberculosis to California, and via San Francisco, he ended up in the silver mines of Nevada. Once settled there he sent for his family. Fanny and the five-year-old Isobel made the long journey via New York City, the isthmus of Panama, San Francisco, and finally by wagons and stage-coach to the mining camps of the Reese River, and the town of Austin in Lander County. Life was difficult in the mining town, and there were few women around. Fanny learned to shoot a pistol and to roll her own cigarettes. The family moved to Virginia City, Nevada. Samuel began philandering with saloon girls, and in 1866 he left to prospect for gold in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains. Fanny and her daughter journeyed to San Francisco. There was a rumour that Sam had been killed by a grizzly bear, but he returned to the family safe in 1868. Shortly thereafter Lloyd was born. Samuel continued philandering and Fanny returned to Indianapolis. The couple were reconciled again in 1869, and lived in Oakland where a second son, Hervey, was born. Fanny took up painting and gardening. However, her husband's behaviour did not improve, and Fanny finally left him in 1875 and moved with her three children to Europe. They lived in Antwerp for three months, and then in order to allow Fanny to study art, moved to Paris where Fanny and Isobel both enrolled in the Acad√©mie Julian. Hervey was sick with scrofulous tuberculosis, died on 5 April 1876, and was buried in a temporary grave at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. While in Paris, Lloyd's mother met and befriended the author, Robert Louis Stevenson. Stevenson and Fanny became deeply attached to each other; in 1880 Fanny divorced her husband and married Stevenson when Lloyd was just twelve years old. As a boy, Lloyd and his stepfather painted a map of an imaginary island, and this was the inspiration for Stevenson's classic Treasure Island. Although he would study engineering at the University of Edinburgh Osbourne wished to become a writer, an idea that was encouraged by his stepfather. South Seas with Stevenson In June 1888, Stevenson chartered a yacht and set sail with his new family from San Francisco across the Pacific Ocean, visiting important island groups.In the South Seas (1896) & (1900) Chatto & Windus; republished by The Hogarth Press (1987). A collection of Stevenson's articles and essays on his travels in the Pacific They stopped for an extended stay in the Hawaiian Islands where Stevenson became good friends with King KalƒÅkaua. In 1890 Lloyd Osbourne, his mother, and Stevenson sailed from Sydney, Australia, into the central Pacific on the steam ship the Janet Nicoll.Janet Nicoll is the correct spelling of trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney, Auckland and into the central Pacific. Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson miss-names the ship as the Janet Nicol in her account of the 1890 voyage, which was published as The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press) Lloyd Osbourne and Stevenson used a plate camera to photograph Pacific Islanders and passengers and crew of the Janet Nicoll.photographs published in The Cruise of the Janet Nichol among the South Sea Islands A Diary by Mrs Robert Louis Stevenson (first published 1914), republished 2004, editor, Roslyn Jolly (U. of Washington Press/U. of New South Wales Press) A passenger on the Janet Nicoll was Jack Buckland, whom Lloyd Osbourne and Stevenson used as a character in The Wrecker (1892). In 1890 the family settled in Samoa, where Stevenson died four years later on December 3. In 1894 Osbourne was appointed vice consul to represent the United States in Samoa. On April 9, 1896, Osbourne married Katherine Durham in Honolulu; their children were Alan (b. 1897) and Louis (b. 1900). The couple divorced in 1914. In 1916 they remarried on condition that there should be no more children; they later divorced again. Later years Osbourne spent the period of 1936 in the South of France with Yvonne Payerne, forty years his junior, by whom he had another son, Samuel (born in Nice, 1936 and died in Los Angeles in 2006), when he was 68 years old. In 1941, Osbourne returned alone to the U.S. when America entered the war. Yvonne and Samuel arrived in New York City on May 22, 1947, the same day that Osbourne died in California.

A long term teacher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, he was President of the American Entomological Society 1900-15. His 1893 publication Catalogue of the Odonata (dragonflies) of the Vicinity of Philadelphia, with an Introduction to the Study of this Group served as a model for regional insect study and was the first major attempt at a guide to the order.

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For Acts passed up until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. For Acts passed from 1707 to 1800 see List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\").

The station's format includes news, music and talk radio. Structure A√ßƒ±k Radyo first began broadcasting November 13, 1995. It is a regional radio station, founded as a private company (as required by Turkish law) but functioning similarly to a nonprofit organization. It has 92 partners, holding near-equal shares. By 2009, A√ßƒ±k Radyo had worked with 935 individuals on more than 822 talk and music shows. All of A√ßƒ±k Radyo's presenters and producers are volunteers except morning show program. Nearly 200 presenters contribute to 134 different programs broadcast on A√ßƒ±k Radyo each week. The radio station has hosted more than 14,000 guests in its 14 years of broadcasting. A√ßƒ±k Radyo, with other stations (including Radio Nova Paris and RBB Multikulti Berlin), carried out a collaborative program of research and technological development on world music and the internet. It has also been carrying out program exchanges with four European radio stations: RBB Multikulti Berlin, VDR Funkhaus, Radio Sweden P6, Europa K√∂ln and Radio Bremen. It also airs world-music programs prepared by three 13-year-old presenters for the nonprofit children's radio station, Radijojo. =Media coverage= A√ßƒ±k Radyo's programs and activities have been reported in more than 6,000 articles, including nearly 120 interviews and broadcasts. It has been the subject of two documentaries. =Online presence= The A√ßƒ±k Radyo website was launched in early 1997; in May 2000, the station began broadcasting online. A second (subscription) website, named the \\"A√ßƒ±k (\\"open\\") Site\\", was launched in late 2001; transcripts from interviews and talk shows are posted. In December 2004, A√ßƒ±k Site's subscription system was eliminated and the two websites were combined. As of 2009, an average of 50,000 people visited the website each month. =Documentaries= In 1996, A√ßƒ±k Radyo acted as a semi-official radio station for the UN HABITAT (II) Conference held in Istanbul, broadcasting bilingually for fifteen days. Since its second year of operation (1996) the station has presented a two-hour yearly wrap-up program, \\"Last Year in Perspective\\", on December 31 each year. In 2005, A√ßƒ±k Radyo produced (in cooperation with Radio Nederland) a two-hour program commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Russell-Einstein Manifesto against nuclear arms. In May 2008, sound collages commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1968 revolution were broadcast daily. =Music festivals and exhibitions= In 1997 and 1998, in collaboration with Positive Organization, A√ßƒ±k Radyo organized the two Istanbul Musical Festivals. Ten thousand people attended each radio festival; the programs featured an eclectic range of music and 125 activities, including activities for children, international panels, world-premiere performances and dance workshops. A√ßƒ±k Radyo co-sponsored two photography exhibitions: \\"1968 Through the Lens of Magnum\\" in 1968 and \\"Portraits of the 20th Century\\" in 2000. Each exhibition drew an audience of about 8,000. In 2006, A√ßƒ±k Radyo organized a fundraiser entitled \\"NaturMort\\" (\\"Still Life\\") to draw attention to global climate change. Six art galleries and 83 artists contributed, donating their proceeds to the station. =Conferences and panels= A√ßƒ±k Radyo organizes five conferences annually. Over 50 conferences have been held at universities and cultural centers, including panels by A√ßƒ±k Radyo editors and programmers on such topics as broadcasting, independent media, freedom of the press, global climate change, globalization and the history of music. =Open-space project= In fall 2005, a group of students from ƒ∞stanbul Bilgi University created a programing contest enabling young people to express themselves through alternative media. This was A√ßƒ±k Radyo's first programming contest for university students (‚ÄúChange the world, even if it‚Äôs for an hour a week‚Äù), followed by a second contest (entitled ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Play!‚Äù) the following year. Sixty-four young people from eighteen universities participated with forty-seven projects. Winning projects were aired on A√ßƒ±k Radyo for six months. =Listener-supported projects= An opinion poll conducted by AC Nielsen in 2000 showed that A√ßik Radyo's \\"core listeners\\" (those who listen every day) numbered around 45,000; those who listened every other day, 80,000; once a week, 120,000; the number of people who listened at least once during the last three months is around 200,000. According to polls conducted by the Istanbul Foundation of Culture and Arts (IKSV) in 2001 and 2003, among music listeners and film-goers at the International Festivals of Classical Music, Jazz, and the Istanbul International Film Festival A√ßik Radyo was chosen as the most popular radio station. In early March 2004 a fundraising project, \\"A√ßik Radyo is seeking its listeners\\", was begun to augment the efforts of the 92 founders and 650 volunteer presenters with contributions from listeners to attain a level of \\"sustainable independence.\\" With the addition of funds raised from a few thousand \\"listener-sponsors\\" to income from advertisements and sponsorship, A√ßik Radyo hoped to reach a level of permanent financial sustainability. During a year-long campaign, listeners were asked to sponsor one (or more) programs. At the end of 2004, the number of sponsors totaled 2,250. The second campaign, in 2005, yielded a similar number of individual sponsors. Every year, A√ßik Radio announces its listener-support project with a one-week radio festival featuring guests and special shows. In March 2006, the third listener-support campaign lasted 99 hours over nine days. One hundred old (and new) presenters came together in panel programmes to discuss the last ten years of culture and music broadcasting of A√ßik Radio and around the world. A fourth project, \\"Altogether with A√ßik Radyo\\", was held between 24 February and 4 March 2007. During these nine days, nearly forty \\"regular\\" listeners participated in programs. At the end of the ninth day, the number of individual sponsors reached 3,000. The fifth special project, \\"Altogether With A√ßik Radyo, Forever!,\\" featured celebrity presenters and articles from the soon-to-be published Open Book (the A√ßik Radyo encyclopedia) were incorporated into programmes by their authors. In March 2009 the sixth listener-support drive was held over nine days, with the majority of listeners renewing their support. At the end of this drive, the number of individual sponsors at A√ßik Radyo reached 4,500. Awards A√ßƒ±k Radyo received 38 awards in Turkey between November 1996 and October 2007.

Together with P≈Çock and Rawa Voivodeships, it formed the province of Masovia. Its area was 23,200 km2., divided into ten lands (see ziemia). The seat of the voivode was Warsaw, local sejmiks also convened in Warsaw, at St. Martin's church. History The voivodeship was officially created by King Sigismund I the Old on December 27, 1529, three years after incorporation of the Duchy of Masovia into the Kingdom of Poland. In the Senate of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, it had eight senators. These were: the Voivode of Mazovia, the Castellan of Czersk, and Castellans of Wizna, Wyszogr√≥d, Zakroczym, Warszawa, Ciechan√≥w, and Liw. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of Masovian Voivodeship: \\"In the general division of the Commonwealth into three provinces: Lesser Poland, Greater Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Mazovia was regarded as part of Province of Greater Poland. This vast land was part of the Kingdom of Poland from the 10th until the 12th century (...) Divided into several smaller parts, it nevertheless remained a separate entity, ruled by one dynasty, with one political, social and legal system. In the years 1462, 1495 and 1526, Mazovian lands were gradually incorporated back into Poland, and divided into three voivodeships ‚Äì Rawa Mazowiecka, P≈Çock and Mazovia. In the 16th century, whole Mazovia had the area of 578 sq. miles, and all three Mazovian voivodeships were divided into 33 counties, with 446 Roman-Catholic parishes, 94 towns and 5990 villages. At the same time, Greater Poland proper had the area of 1051 sq. miles, with 6471 villages, while Lesser Poland proper, with the area of 1013 sq. miles, had 5500 villages. As we see, Mazovia, much smaller than Greater and Lesser Poland, had the same number of villages. Per square mile, there were 6 villages in Greater Poland, 5 villages in Lesser Poland, and as many as 10 villages in Mazovia. In Ciechan√≥w County, there were 23 villages per sq. mile, which was the highest number in the whole kingdom (...) The population of Mazovia would be even higher, if it had not been for the proximity of Podlasie, Rus‚Äô, and Lithuania. Since the 14th century, local nobility would settle in those areas in great numbers. Still, Mazovia was among the most densely populated provinces of Poland, together with ≈Åƒôczyca Land, Kujawy and Dobrzy≈Ñ Land\\".

It is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent where it is found in tall grasslands and is best known for the leaping breeding displays made by the males during the monsoon season. The male has a contrasting black and white breeding plumage and distinctive elongated head feathers that extend behind the neck. These bustards are found mainly in northwestern and central India during the summer but are found more widely distributed across India in winter. The species is highly endangered and has been extirpated in some parts of its range such as Pakistan. It is threatened both by hunting and habitat degradation. The only similar species is the Bengal florican (Houbarobsis bengalensis) which is larger and lacks the white throat, collar and elongated plumes. Description Male lesser florican A female lesser florican in flight from Rajasthan, India A male in breeding plumage has a black head, neck and lower parts. However, his throat is white. Around three 4 inch long, ribbon-like feathers arise from behind the ear-coverts on each side of the head and extend backwards, curving up and ending in spatulate tip. The back and scapulars are mottled in white with V shaped marks. The wing coverts are white. After the breedings season, the male tends to have some white in the wing. The female is slightly larger than the male. The females and males in non breeding plumage are buff with black streaks with darker markings on the head and neck. The back is mottled and barred in black. The neck and upper breast are buff with the streaks decreasing towards the belly. The outer primaries of the males are thin and notched on the inner-web. The leg are pale yellow and the iris is yellow. A male lesser florican from Rajasthan, India Young birds have a distinct U shaped mark on the neck near the throat. Taxonomy and systematics James Forbes (1749-1819), the collector of Bharuch noted in his Oriental Memoirs (1813) that \\"The Curmoor or Florican exceeds all the Indian wild-fowl in delicay of flavour\\" The two species of smaller bustards have been called \\"floricans\\". The word has been thought to be of Dutch origin. The genus Sypheotides earlier included what is now Houbaropsis bengalensis (or Bengal florican), the two species being small and showing reverse sexual size dimorphism. The tarsus is long in Sypheotides and the seasonal plumage change in male has led to the retention of the separate genus, although the two genera are evolutionarily close. Male and female plumages were initially thought of as separate species leading to the names aurita and indica and the species has been placed in the past in the genera Otis, Eupodotis and Sypheotis. The species ending which is related to the gender of the Latin genus has been debated and it believed that indicus is correct. The horizontal body carriage, size and habit of holding up their tail feathers when walking on the ground have led their local names to make associations with peacocks, with a popular name being the equivalent of \\"grass peacock\\" (such as khar-mor, tan-mor) in some areas. the name Likh is used in northwestern India and adopted by British sportsmen in India. Distribution and habitat The species was formerly more widespread across much of the Republic of India but not in Sri Lanka. It breeds mainly in the central and western parts of India. Historic records exist from the Makran coast of Balochistan province in Pakistan. A record from Burma has been questioned. The species is said to move in response to rainfall and their presence at locations can be erratic, with sudden large numbers in some seasons. About 500 males in Gujarat were ringed and nearly 18 were recovered, most of them within about 50 kilometres of their ringing sites. The preferred habitat is grasslands but it sometimes occurs in fields such as those of cotton and lentils. Breeding areas are today restricted mainly to Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, some areas in southern Nepal and parts of Andhra Pradesh. Managing florican habitats as grassland interspersed with croplands and pastures spared rotationally provided optimal results at low production-level.Dutta, Sutirtha, and Yadvendradev Jhala. \\"Planning agriculture based on landuse responses of threatened semiarid grassland species in India.\\" Biological Conservation 175 (2014): 129-139. Behaviour and ecology Eggs of the lesser florican showing colour variation These bustards are found either singly or in pairs in thick grassland or sometimes in crop fields. Indigenous tribal hunters regularly shot the males during the breeding season, as they were easy to spot because of their courtship display. It was said to be good for eating but considered inferior to the meat of the Bengal florican. They fly faster than other bustards and give a duck-like impression in flight. =Diet= Lesser floricans feed on a wide variety of small vertebrates and invertebrates which include worms, centipedes, lizards, frogs and insects such as locusts, flying ants and hairy caterpillars. They are also known to feed on shoots and seeds, herbs and berries. Usually floricans feed during the early hours of mornings or in the evenings, except in the case of newly migrated birds which feed throughout the day. =Reproduction= The breeding season varies with the onset of the Southwest Monsoon and is September to October in northern India and April to May in parts of southern India. During the breeding season, males leap suddenly from the grass with a peculiar croaking or knocking call, flutter their wings and fall back with slightly open wings. At the apogee of the leap the neck is arched backwards and the legs folded as if in a sitting posture. These jumps are repeated after intervals of about three or more minutes. The displays are made mainly in the early mornings and late evenings, but during other parts of the day in cloudy weather. The breeding system is said to be a dispersed lek with each male holding a territory of about 1-2 hectares. Males are said to favour particular display sites and shooting of these displaying birds has led to sharp declines in the populations in the past. Lek sites tend to have flat ground with low vegetation and good visibility and well used sites usually show signs of trampling. Females have a defensive display at nest which involves spreading their wings, tail and neck feathers. The females are said to produce a whistling call which attracts males. Males are aggressive towards other males in the neighbourhood. The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground and 3-4 (1.88 x 1.6 inches) eggs are laid. The nest location is usually in dense grass. Females take sole part in incubation and rearing the chicks. The incubation period is about 21 days.

cyclostomes (which also refers to a group of jawless fish called Cyclostomata), are an ancient order of stenolaemate bryozoans which first appeared in the Lower Ordovician. It consists of 7+ suborders, 59+ families, 373+ genera, and 666+ species. The cyclostome bryozoans were dominant in the Mesozoic; since that era, they have decreased. Currently, cyclostomes seldom constitute more than 20% of the species recorded in regional bryozoan faunas. Taxonomy Traditionally, cyclostomes have been divided into two groups according to skeletal organization. In free-walled (or double-walled) cyclostomes, the exterior frontal walls of the zooids are uncalcified; autozooids have either a polygonal aperture bounded by vertical interior walls, or alternatively a subcircular aperture in species with kenozooids filling the spaces between the autozooids. By contrast, fixed- walled (or single-walled) cyclostomes have much of the exterior frontal wall calcified; autozooids normally have a subcircular aperture located at or close to the frontal wall. Anatomy Among cyclostome bryozoans, the calcitic skeleton is usually lamellar, consisting of tabular or lath-like crystallites stacked like tiles at a low angle to the wall surface. Cheilostome bryozoans may exhibit a similar ultrastructure but more commonly have fibrous skeletons consisting of needle-like or bladed crystallites oriented almost perpendicular to wall surfaces. The skeletal parts of individual feeding zooids - autozooecia - are typically long, curved tubes with terminal apertures which are either circular or polygonal in shape. Colonies vary greatly in form according to species. Many cyclostomes have encrusting colonies, firmly cemented to hard substrates such as rocks and shells. These usually grow as subcircular sheets, spots or pimples, or systems of ramifying branches. Most erect cyclostomes develop bushy colonies with narrow, bifurcating branches. Feeding zooids are borne either evenly around the branch circumference or are absent from one face. New zooids are generally formed in distinct budding zones, for example, around the outer circumference of subcircular encrusting colonies, or at the tips of the branches in ramifying encrusting and bushy erect colonies. All post-Palaeozoic cyclostomes have interzooidal connections via pores in the vertical walls separating adjacent zooids. In the fixed- walled forms, these narrow pores constitute the only coelomic connection, because the vertical walls contact and fuse with the calcified, exterior frontal walls. However, in free-walled forms, the frontal walls are uncalcified, and no contact is made with the vertical walls, creating a wider coelomic connection around the distal ends of the vertical walls. Polymorphism of zooids is less conspicuous than in cheilostomes. However, almost all cyclostome species have enlarged zooids - gonozooids - for brooding larvae, and some species also possess non-feeding zooids - kenozooids - with space- filling and structural roles. Modern cyclostomes exhibit polyembryony: fertilised ova divide to produce multiple, genetically identical larvae which are housed in the spacious gonozooid before being released, swimming for a short period before settling and undergoing metamorphosis to establish new clonal colonies. Gonozooids are also very important in the taxonomy of cyclostomes, particularly in the largest suborder the Tubuliporina. Unfortunately not all colonies develop gonozooids and infertile colonies may be difficult to identify even to family-level. Differentiation A colony is founded by a larva which settles and metamorphoses into a zooid, the ancestrula. In Cyclostomata it may be of two types: holoancestrula and artroancenstrula (in crisiids) The ancestrula gives rise to a second generation of zooids, which in turn gives rise to a third, and so on, in a process called astogeny. Generational variation among zooids is called astogenetic differentiation. In all species, there is a primary zone of differentiation, which is limited to the first few generations and followed by a much longer zone of repetition of nearly identical zooids. In some species, however, there is a secondary differentiated zone, which can take various forms. In species in which the colony branches, new branches normally arise by division of a distal growing tip of an existing branch. An adventitious branch, in contrast, is one that arises from the side of an existing branch, beginning with a short series of differentiated zooids, a secondary zone. Subsequent generations of zooids along the branch then typically return to the normal colony budding pattern. Ecology At the present day cyclostome bryozoans are exclusively marine and stenohaline, with most species living subtidally on the continental shelf. Relative to cheilostomes, they appear to be less numerous and diverse in low latitudes - temperate and arctic environments host almost all of the large species. Although some cyclostomes encrust fleshy algae, the majority colonize hard substrates. Encrusting species can be especially numerous in cryptic habitats, for example, the concave interiors of bivalve shells. Cyclostomes are comparatively poor competitors for living space - they are routinely overgrown by larger animals such as sponges and ascidians, and also lose the majority of competitive encounters for space with cheilostome bryozoans. Tentacle size and number tend to be smaller in species of cyclostomes than cheilostomes. As a result, cyclostomes create less powerful feeding currents. Colony size is small in many encrusting species, suggesting a \\"weedy\\", opportunistic life-style. These small encrusting colonies probably live for less than a year, whereas some of the larger encrusting and erect colonies are undoubtedly perennials. However, scant data exists on growth rates in cyclostomes. Little is known about predation specifically on cyclostomes although it is likely that they are preyed upon by the nudibranchs (sea-slugs), pycnogonids (sea-spiders), echinoids and fishes which consume other marine bryozoans. Little is known about the reproductive ecology of cyclostomes. Sperm are known to be released from the tips of the tentacles, as in other bryozoans, but fertilization of eggs has never been observed. It is unclear if each gonozooid broods a single or multiple clutches of larvae, whether one or more clones of polyembryonous larvae are present per gonozooid, and what is the duration of the brooding period.

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For Acts passed up until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. For Acts passed from 1707 to 1800 see List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number. All modern Acts have a short title, e.g. the Local Government Act 2003. Some earlier Acts also have a short title given to them by later Acts, such as by the Short Titles Act 1896. 1880‚Äì1889 =1880= 43 Vict. * Appropriation Act 1880 c. 13 * Army Discipline and Regulation

It is written in the form of absurd historical stories, complex charts and graphs, and fake newspaper columns. Among its sections are a list of 700 different hobo names and complete descriptions of \\"all 51\\" US states. The full title of the book is: :An Almanac of Complete World Knowledge Compiled with Instructive Annotation and Arranged in Useful Order by myself, John Hodgman, a Professional Writer, in The Areas of My Expertise, which Include: Matters Historical, Matters Literary, Matters Cryptozoological, Hobo Matters, Food, Drink & Cheese (a Kind of Food), Squirrels & Lobsters & Eels, Haircuts, Utopia, What Will Happen in the Future, and Most Other Subjects The book was later released in audiobook form, narrated by John Hodgman himself with some musical accompaniment by frequent collaborator Jonathan Coulton and a guest appearance by Paul Rudd. The interior and exterior of the book are designed by graphic artist Sam Potts who is known for the interior and exterior design of the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. and The Writer's Block. A sequel, More Information Than You Require, was released on October 21, 2008.  The 700 Hoboes Project and e-Hobo.com  The 700 Hoboes Project refers to an internet meme that originated with a recording of Hodgman's recitation of the 700 hobo names from The Areas of My Expertise. An audio file of the reading, accompanied by frequent collaborator Jonathan Coulton playing \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\" \\"live for an hour, one take\\", was posted to a page on the promotional website for the book. In October 2005, on hearing the audio file, Mark Frauenfelder proposed on the BoingBoing website to have \\"700 cartoonists volunteer to draw one of the 700 hoboes\\" that Hodgman listed in the book. A few days later, the first of the 700 hoboes (\\"Stewbuilder Dennis\\") was posted to Flickr by Daniel Cardenas and a Flickr group (700 Hoboes) was subsequently formed. In March 2006, several contributors to the 700 Hoboes Project decided to build a portal to house the drawings posted to the Flickr group. Len Peralta of Jawbone Radio came up with a design for the site and passed it on to Dan Coulter, who built a back end system using phpFlickr, his open source wrapper for Flickr's API. Hobo illustrators Adam Koford, Mike Peterson, Ben Rollman and Eric Vespoor contributed to the creation of the website, www.e-hobo.com. The URL refers to hobo #450 in the list, \\"my-e-hobo.com\\". The 700 names were completed on September 5, 2006, coinciding with the release date of Areas of My Expertise to paperback, which contains an additional 100 hobo names. As of September 2006, there have been over 200 contributors to the project, spanning the globe. In March 2007, Adam Koford completed illustrating each of the 800 hoboes.  The Furry Old Lobster  The \\"furry old lobster\\" as illustrated in the book. In one section of The Areas of My Expertise, \\"A Brief Time Line of the Lobster in America,\\" Hodgman explains that lobsters as we know them today were not introduced to Maine until the turn of the century, after Theodore Roosevelt built a secret canal from lobster-ridden New York City to the coast of Maine. Before that time, writes Hodgman, an entirely different animal - particularly \\"a kind of sea otter\\" - was known in Maine as the \\"lobster\\" (the photo of a European otter at right is included with the caption \\"Figure 11: The Lobster\\"). The new lobster threatened the existence of the \\"Old Lobster,\\" the last of which died in 1980, in the kitchen of a Furry Old Lobster restaurant (which itself is part of a conglomeration owned by [new] lobsters). While Hodgman's story is entirely fictional, an actual furry lobster, Kiwa hirsuta, was discovered in March 2005 in the South Pacific. Hodgman includes a photo of the newly discovered crustacean in the rear cover of the paperback edition of The Areas of My Expertise, along with the words, \\"Some readers have taken this as a worrisome portent that certain items in my book of lies may be coming true. BUT BE CALM. If you observe the 'FURRY OLD LOBSTER' described in my book, you will see that [that creature and the newly discovered species] are not the same creature at all, though both are DISGUSTINGLY FURRY.\\" Since then, the book's official website has a page dedicated to the matter, including a photo of the otter-like \\"lobster\\" with the caption \\"Old furry old lobster.\\"Furry lobster page Musician/Hodgman collaborator Jonathan Coulton has written a song called \\"Furry Old Lobster\\", telling the tale of the lost species. Coulton has performed the song on Attack of the Show, at many of Hodgman's book signings, and on the audiobook version of The Areas of My Expertise.  The 51 United States  An additional section in Areas of My Expertise, Part Six, \\"Our 51 United States,\\" contains Hodgman's own descriptions of the states of the United States, including nicknames and mottos. The 51st state, Hodgman says, is called \\"Hohoq (also known as Ar)\\" and \\"frequently moves across the continent by unknown means and seems to disappear altogether.\\"Hodgman, J: (2005). The Areas of My Expertise. Dutton, page 165. He also says that Hohoq is home to the \\"Thunderbirds,\\" giant eagles who shoot lightning from their eyes and transform into men. The state is described as having a complicated political history with the federal government, at one point being represented in the Senate by an enormous shape-shifting raven.  Kingdom of Loathing  The internet browser game The Kingdom of Loathing features a playable game area named Hobopolis, which was directly inspired by Hodgman's work. The hobos that appear in Hobopolis (with the exception of the six bosses) are randomly named, although the possibilities borrow heavily from Hodgman's list of hobo names. The final boss, Hodgman the Hoboverlord, is named for John Hodgman himself. The developers of The Kingdom of Loathing were granted personal permission by Hodgman to use his material, as well as his name, for the game. He was reportedly \\"flattered\\". Furthermore, a tattoo that can be obtained in-game from Hobopolis is the same as the hobo marking that means \\"It is time for hoboes to take over the United States government\\" in Hodgman's book.

Dates given for the establishment of Scone Priory have ranged from 1114 A.D. to 1122 A.D. However, historians have long believed that Scone was before that time the center of the early medieval Christian cult of the Culdees (C√©li D√© in medieval Irish meaning \\"Companions of God\\"). Very little is known about the Culdees but it is thought that a cult may have been worshiping at Scone from as early as 700 A.D. Archaeological surveys taken in 2007 suggest that Scone was a site of real significance even prior to 841 A.D., when Kenneth MacAlpin brought the Stone of Destiny, Scotland's most prized relic and coronation stone, to Scone. Origins The priory was established by six canons from Nostell Priory in West Yorkshire under the leadership of Prior Robert, who was the first prior of Scone (later Bishop of St Andrews). The foundation charter, dated 1120, was once thought to be a fake version of the original, but it is now regarded as a copy made in the late 12th century . Perhaps the copy was needed after a fire which occurred there sometime before 1163 A.D. and presumably damaged or destroyed the original. Scone Priory suffered a similar destruction of records during the Wars of Scottish Independence. Transition to abbey status In either 1163 A.D. or 1164 A.D., during the reign of King M√°el Coluim IV, Scone Priory's status was raised and it became an abbey. Scone Abbey had important royal functions, since it was located next to the coronation site of Scottish kings and housed the Stone of Destiny until its theft by King Edward I of England. Scone Abbey was, according to King M√°el Coluim IV, \\"in principali sede regni nostri\\" (RRS, no. 243; trs. \\"in the principal seat of our kingdom\\"). As such, Scone Abbey was one of the chief residences of the Scottish kings, who were hosted by the abbot during their stay at Scone. Most likely the king stayed in the abbot's own rooms within the abbot's palace. It is very likely that the abbey buildings (now gone) overlapped with the modern palace. The abbey also had relics of a now obscure saint by the name of St Fergus (also Fergustian), which made it a popular place of pilgrimage. Although the abbey long remained famous for its music since Robert Carver produced there some of Europe's best late medieval choral music into the late 16th century, its status declined over time. In March 1540 one of the canons, Andrew Murehead, sent a gift of rose water made at the Abbey to James V at Stirling Castle.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society X (Edinburgh, 1965), p. 35. =Scottish Reformation= After the reformation in 1559, Scottish abbeys disappeared as institutions, although not overnight, as some suggest. The abbey at Scone continued to function well into the 17th century. There are existing documents describing repairs made to the spire of the abbey church dating from A.D. 1620. Scone Abbey and its attendant parish ceased to function in 1640 and was reformed in the late 16th century as a secular lordship first for the Earl of Gowrie, and then for Sir David Murray of Gospertie. The property and lordship have been in the possession of the Murrays of Scone ever since. Later, this branch of the Murray clan became the Earls of Mansfield. Scone Abbey flourished for over four hundred years. In 1559 during the early days of the Scottish Reformation the abbey fell victim to a Protestant mob from Dundee who were whipped into a zealous frenzy by the great reformer John Knox. The abbey was badly damaged despite Knox's attempt to calm the mob as they approached Perth. Despite this setback Scone Abbey was repaired and continued to function for another ninety years. The abbey estates were later granted to Lord Ruthven, who later became the Earl of Gowrie. Lord Ruthven held extensive estates in Scotland including Ruthven Castle near Perth, now called Huntingtower Castle, and Dirleton Castle. The Ruthvens rebuilt the Abbot's Palace of the old abbey as a grand residence in 1580. In 1600, James VI charged the family with treason after the Gowrie Conspiracy, banned the use of the name \\"Ruthven\\" and confiscated their states. The Gowrie lands at Scone including the Abbot's Palace were granted to Sir David Murray of Gospetrie, who later was made the 1st Lord Scone and Viscount Stormont, as a reward for interceding on the king's behalf to quell the people of Perth in the chaotic aftermath of the Gowrie Conspiracy. Rediscovery The precise location of Scone Abbey had long remained a mystery, but in 2007 archaeologists pinpointed the location using magnetic resonance imaging technology. The find revealed the structure to have been somewhat larger than had been imagined and revealed that the Moot Hill had at some point been surrounded by a ditch and palisade; marking it out not as a defensive position but as a hugely significant sanctum within which kings professed their vows to the people of Scotland. A stylised illustration of the abbey on one of its seals suggests that it was a major Romanesque building, with a central tower crowned with a spire. In 2008 an archaeological dig at the abbey revealed burials with three complete human skeletons.

Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751 in order to preempt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem. The poem is an elegy in name but not in form; it employs a style similar to that of contemporary odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death. Claimed as \\"probably still today the best-known and best-loved poem in English\\", the Elegy quickly became popular. It was printed many times and in a variety of formats, translated into many languages, and praised by critics even after Gray's other poetry had fallen out of favour. Later critics tended to comment on its language and universal aspects, but some felt the ending was unconvincing‚Äîfailing to resolve the questions the poem raised‚Äîor that the poem did not do enough to present a political statement that would serve to help the obscure rustic poor who form its central image. Background Thomas Gray, by John Giles Eccardt, 1747‚Äì48, National Portrait Gallery, London Gray's life was surrounded by loss and death, and many people whom he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded a few days later by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh in the minds of the Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter into a sort of rebirth cycle or, should he die, if there would be anyone to remember him. Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering. On 3 June 1750, Gray moved to Stoke Poges, and on 12 June he completed Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. Immediately, he included the poem in a letter he sent to Walpole, that said:. The letter reveals that Gray felt that the poem was unimportant, and that he did not expect it to become as popular or influential as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being that he was able to complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus. The version that was later published and reprinted was a 32-stanza version with the \\"Epitaph\\" conclusion. Before the final version was published, it was circulated in London society by Walpole, who ensured that it would be a popular topic of discussion throughout 1750. By February 1751, Gray received word that William Owen, the publisher of the Magazine of Magazines, would print the poem on 16 February; the copyright laws of the time did not require Gray's approval for publication. With Walpole's help, he was able to convince Robert Dodsley to print the poem on 15 February as a quarto pamphlet. Walpole added a preface to the poem reading: \\"The following POEM came into my hands by Accident, if the general Approbation with which this little Piece has been spread, may be call'd by so slight a Term as Accident. It is the Approbation which makes it unnecessary for me to make any Apology but to the Author: As he cannot but feel some Satisfaction in having pleas'd so many Readers already, I flatter myself he will forgive my communicating that Pleasure to many more.\\"Quoted in . The pamphlet contained woodblock illustrations and was printed without attribution to Gray, at his request. Immediately after, Owen's magazine with Gray's poem was printed but contained multiple errors and other problems. In a 20 February letter to Walpole, Gray thanked him for intervening and helping to get a quality version of the poem published before Owen. It was so popular that it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The revised version of 1768 was that later printed.. Composition Holograph manuscript of Gray's \\"Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard\\" The poem most likely originated in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: \\"I am inclined to believe that the Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [August 1742] also: Though I am aware that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in my notes on the poem.\\"Quoted in . Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called \\"Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard\\". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted to work out the ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost. There are two possible ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, argues that the Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. According to Mason the early version of the poem was finished in August 1742, but there is little evidence to give such a definite date. He argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information. Instead, Walpole wrote to Mason to say: \\"The Churchyard was, I am persuaded, posterior to West's death at least three or four years, as you will see by my note. At least I am sure that I had the twelve or more first lines from himself above three years after that period, and it was long before he finished it.\\"Quoted in . The two did not resolve their disagreement, but Walpole did concede the matter, possibly to keep the letters between them polite. But Gray's outline of the events provides the second possible way the poem was composed: the first lines of the poem were written some time in 1746 and he probably wrote more of the poem during the time than Walpole claimed. The letters show the likelihood of Walpole's date for the composition, as a 12 June 1750 letter from Gray to Walpole stated that Walpole was provided lines from the poem years before and the two were not on speaking terms until after 1745. The only other letter to discuss the poem was one sent to Wharton on 11 September 1746, which alludes to the poem being worked on. Genre The poem is not a conventional part of the Classical genre of Theocritan elegy, because it does not mourn an individual. The use of \\"elegy\\" is related to the poem relying on the concept of , or disquiet regarding the human condition. The poem lacks many standard features of the elegy: an invocation, mourners, flowers, and shepherds. The theme does not emphasise loss as do other elegies, and its natural setting is not a primary component of its theme. Through the \\"Epitaph\\" at the end, it can be included in the tradition as a memorial poem, and it contains thematic elements of the elegiac genre, especially mourning. But as compared to a poem recording personal loss such as John Milton's \\"Lycidas\\", it lacks many of the ornamental aspects found in that poem. Gray's is natural, whereas Milton's is more artificially designed. In evoking the English countryside, the poem belongs to the picturesque tradition found in John Dyer's Grongar Hill (1726), and the long line of topographical imitations it inspired. However, it diverges from this tradition in focusing on the death of a poet. Much of the poem deals with questions that were linked to Gray's own life; during the poem's composition, he was confronted with the death of others and questioned his own mortality. Although universal in its statements on life and death, the poem was grounded in Gray's feelings about his own life, and served as an epitaph for himself. As such, it falls within an old poetic tradition of poets contemplating their legacy. The poem, as an elegy, also serves to lament the death of others, including West, though at a remove. This is not to say that Gray's poem was like others of the graveyard school of poetry; instead, Gray tried to avoid a description that would evoke the horror common to other poems in the elegiac tradition. This is compounded further by the narrator trying to avoid an emotional response to death, by relying on rhetorical questions and discussing what his surroundings lack.. Nevertheless, the sense of kinship with Robert Blair's \\"The Grave\\" was so generally recognised that Gray's Elegy was added to several editions of Blair's poem between 1761‚Äì1808, after which other works began to be included as well.Northup, items 507, 515, 517, 533, 534, 542, 560, 571 The performance is connected with the several odes that Gray also wrote and those of Joseph Warton and William Collins. The poem, as it developed from its original form, advanced from the Horatian manner and became more Miltonic. The poem actively relied on \\"English\\" techniques and language. The stanza form, quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, was common to English poetry and used throughout the 16th century. Any foreign diction that Gray relied on was merged with English words and phrases to give them an \\"English\\" feel. Many of the foreign words Gray adapted were previously used by Shakespeare or Milton, securing an \\"English\\" tone, and he emphasised monosyllabic words throughout his elegy to add a rustic English tone.. Poem William Blake's watercolour illustration of the first stanza The poem begins in a churchyard with a speaker who is describing his surroundings in vivid detail. The speaker emphasises both aural and visual sensations as he examines the area in relation to himself: As the poem continues, the speaker begins to focus less on the countryside and more on his immediate surroundings. His descriptions move from sensations to his own thoughts as he begins to emphasise what is not present in the scene; he contrasts an obscure country life with a life that is remembered. This contemplation provokes the speaker's thoughts on the natural process of wastage and unfulfilled potential. The speaker focuses on the inequities that come from death, obscuring individuals, while he begins to resign himself to his own inevitable fate. As the poem ends, the speaker begins to deal with death in a direct manner as he discusses how humans desire to be remembered. As the speaker does so, the poem shifts and the first speaker is replaced by a second who describes the death of the first: A page from the 1846 illuminated edition designed by Owen Jones The poem concludes with a description of the poet's grave, over which the speaker is meditating, together with a description of the end of the poet's life: An epitaph is included after the conclusion of the poem. The epitaph reveals that the poet whose grave is the focus of the poem was unknown and obscure. Circumstance kept the poet from becoming something greater, and he was separated from others because he was unable to join in the common affairs of their life: The original conclusion from the earlier version of the poem confronts the reader with the inevitable prospect of death and advises resignation, which differs from the indirect, third-person description in the final version: Themes Frontispiece to 1753 edition of Elegy by Bentley The poem connects with many earlier British poems that contemplate death and seek to make it more familiar and tame,. including Jonathan Swift's satirical Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift. But when compared to other works by the so-called Graveyard poets, such as Blair's The Grave (1743), Gray's poem has less emphasis on common images found there. His description of the moon, birds and trees dispels the horror found in them, and he largely avoids mentioning the word \\"grave\\", instead using euphemisms. There is a difference in tone between the two versions of the elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death. The first version of the elegy is among the few early poems composed by Gray in English, including \\"Sonnet on the Death of Richard West\\", his \\"Eton Ode\\", and his \\"Ode to Adversity\\". All four contain Gray's meditations on mortality that were inspired by West's death. The later version of the poem keeps the stoic resignation regarding death, for the narrator still accepts death. The poem concludes with an epitaph, which reinforces Gray's indirect and reticent manner of writing. Although the ending reveals the narrator's repression of feelings surrounding his inevitable fate, it is optimistic. The epitaph describes faith in a \\"trembling hope\\" that he cannot know while alive. In describing the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's philosophy of the sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described in the beginning of the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter. On the difference between the obscure and the renowned in the poem, scholar Lord David Cecil argued: \\"Death, he perceives, dwarfs human differences. There is not much to choose between the great and the humble, once they are in the grave. It may be that there never was; it may be that in the obscure graveyard lie those who but for circumstance would have been as famous as Milton and Hampden.\\". However, death is not completely democratic because \\"if circumstances prevented them from achieving great fame, circumstances also saved them from committing great crimes. Yet there is a special pathos in these obscure tombs; the crude inscriptions on the clumsy monuments are so poignant a reminder of the vain longing of all men, however humble, to be loved and to be remembered.\\" The poem ends with the narrator turning towards his own fate, accepting his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is mysterious and tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.. Many scholars, including Lonsdale, believe that the poem's message is too universal to require a specific event or place for inspiration, but Gray's letters suggest that there were historical influences in its composition. In particular, it is possible that Gray was interested in debates over the treatment of the poor, and that he supported the political structure of his day, which was to support the poor who worked but look down on those that refused to. However, Gray's message is incomplete, because he ignored the poor's past rebellions and struggles. The poem ignores politics to focus on various comparisons between a rural and urban life in a psychological manner. The argument between living a rural life or urban life lets Gray discuss questions that answer how he should live his own life, but the conclusion of the poem does not resolve the debate as the narrator is able to recreate himself in a manner that reconciles both types of life while arguing that poetry is capable of preserving those who have died. It is probable that Gray wanted to promote the hard work of the poor but to do nothing to change their social position. Instead of making claims of economic injustice, Gray accommodates differing political views. This is furthered by the ambiguity in many of the poem's lines, including the statement \\"Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood\\" that could be read either as Oliver Cromwell being guiltless for violence during the English Civil War or merely as villagers being compared to the guilty Cromwell. The poem's primary message is to promote the idea of \\"Englishness\\", and the pastoral English countryside. The earlier version lacks many of the later version's English aspects, especially as Gray replaced many classical figures with English ones: Cato the Younger by Hampden, Tully by Milton, and Julius Caesar by Cromwell. Influence The Elegy gained wide popularity almost immediately on its first publication and by the mid-twentieth century was still considered one of the best known English poems, although its status in this respect has probably declined since then. It has had several kinds of influence. =Poetic parallels= In choosing an \\"English\\" over a Classical setting, Gray provided a model for later poets wishing to describe England and the English countryside during the second half of the 18th century. Once Gray had set the example, any occasion would do to give a sense of the effects of time in a landscape, as for instance in the passage of the seasons as described in John Scott‚Äôs Four Elegies, descriptive and moral (1757).The Beauties of the Poets, pp.99-114 Other imitations, though avoiding overt verbal parallels, chose similar backgrounds to signal their parentage. One favourite theme was a meditation among ruins, such as John Langhorne's Written among the ruins of Pontefract Castle (1756),The Poetical Works of John Langhorne, vol. 1, pp. 148‚Äì150 Edward Moore's ‚ÄúAn elegy, written among the ruins of a nobleman's seat in Cornwall\\" (1756)Poetical Works, pp.131-3 and John Cunningham's \\"An elegy on a pile of ruins\\" (1761). Gray's friend William Mason chose an actual churchyard in south Wales for his Elegy VI (1787), adding a reference to the poet in the text. He also provided a final note explaining that the poem was written \\"to make it appear a day scene, and as such to contrast it with the twilight scene of my excellent Friend's Elegy\\".Poems of William Mason, Chiswick 1822, pp.90-94 A kinship between Gray's Elegy and Oliver Goldsmith's The Deserted Village has been recognised, although the latter was more openly political in its treatment of the rural poor and used heroic couplets, where the elegist poets kept to cross-rhymed quatrains. At first it was collected in various editions along with Gray's poem and other topographical works, but from 1873 a number of editions appeared which contained just the Elegy and The Deserted Village, though sometimes with the inclusion of Goldsmith's The Traveller or some other single work as well.Northup, items 635, 673, 684, 705, 727a, 727c, 728a, 735e At that period an anonymous review in The Academy (12 December 1896) claimed that \\"Gray's 'Elegy' and Goldsmith's 'The Deserted Village' shine forth as the two human poems in a century of artifice.\\" 18th century tombs \\"beneath the yew tree's shade\\" in Stoke Poges churchyard The Elegy's continued influence in the 19th century provoked a response from the Romantic poets, who often attempted to define their own beliefs in reaction to Gray's. Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example, who as a schoolboy was given the exercise of translating part of the Elegy into Latin, eventually wrote his own meditation among the graves in 1815. His \\"A Summer Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire\\" is metrically more inventive and written in a six-line stanza that terminates Gray's cross-rhymed quatrain with a couplet. In theme and tendency Shelley's poem closely resembles the setting of the Elegy but concludes that there is something appealing in death that frees it of terror.The Poems of Shelley, Volume 1, pp. 451‚Äì453 In the Victorian period, Alfred, Lord Tennyson adopted many features of the Elegy in his own extended meditation on death, In Memoriam. He established a ceremonial, almost religious, tone by reusing the idea of the \\"knell\\" that \\"tolls\\" to mark the coming night. This is followed with the poet narrator looking through letters of his deceased friend, echoing Gray's narrator reading the tombstones to connect to the dead. Robert Browning relied on a similar setting to the Elegy in his pastoral poem \\"Love Among the Ruins\\" which describes the desire for glory and how everything ends in death. Unlike Gray, Browning adds a female figure and argues that nothing but love matters. Thomas Hardy, who had memorised Gray's poem, took the title of his fourth novel, Far from the Madding Crowd, from a line in it. In addition, many in his Wessex Poems and Other Verses (1898) contain a graveyard theme and take a similar stance to Gray, and its frontispiece depicts a graveyard. It is also possible that parts of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets are derived from the Elegy, although Eliot believed that Gray's diction, along with 18th-century poetic diction in general, was restrictive and limited. But the Four Quartets cover many of the same views, and Eliot's village is similar to Gray's hamlet. There are many echoes of Gray's language throughout the Four Quartets; both poems rely on the yew tree as an image and use the word \\"twittering\\", which was uncommon at the time. Each of Eliot's four poems has parallels to Gray's poem, but \\"Little Gidding\\" is deeply indebted to the Elegy's meditation on a \\"neglected spot\\". Of the similarities between the poems, it is Eliot's reuse of Gray's image of \\"stillness\\" that forms the strongest parallel, an image that is essential to the poem's arguments on mortality and society. =Adaptations and parodies= On the basis of some 2000 examples, one commentator has argued that \\"Gray's Elegy has probably inspired more adaptations than any other poem in the language\\".W.B.Carnochan, Notes & Queries 58.4, Oxford 2011, pp. 546‚Äì548 It has also been suggested that parody acts as a kind of translation into the same tongue as the original,Weinbrott, Howard D., \\"Translation and parody: towards the genealogy of the Augustan imitation\\" in ELH 33.4, Johns Hopkins University 1966 pp. 434-447 something that the printing history of some examples seems to confirm. One of the earliest, John Duncombe‚Äôs ‚ÄúAn evening contemplation in a college‚Äù (1753), frequently reprinted to the end of the 18th century, was included alongside translations of the Elegy into Latin and Italian in the 1768 and 1775 Dublin editions and 1768 Cork edition of Gray's works. In the case of the American The Political Passing Bell: An Elegy. Written in a Country Meeting House, April 1789; Parodized from Gray for the Entertainment of Those Who Laugh at All Parties by George Richards (d.1804) and published from Boston MA, the parody was printed opposite Gray's original page by page, making the translation to the political context more obvious. A shift in context was the obvious starting point in many of these works and, where sufficiently original, contributed to the author's own literary fortunes. This was the case with Edward Jerningham's The Nunnery: an elegy in imitation of the Elegy in a Churchyard, published in 1762. Profiting by its success, Jerningham followed it up in successive years with other poems on the theme of nuns, in which the connection with Gray's work, though less close, was maintained in theme, form and emotional tone: The Magdalens: An Elegy (1763); The Nun: an elegy (1764); and ‚ÄúAn Elegy Written Among the Ruins of an Abbey‚Äù (1765), which is derivative of the earlier poems on ruins by Moore and Cunningham. At the opposite extreme, Gray's poem provided a format for a surprising number that purport to be personal descriptions of life in gaol, starting with An elegy in imitation of Gray, written in the King's Bench Prison by a minor (London 1790),Northup item 918 which is close in title to William Thomas Moncrieff‚Äôs later \\"Prison Thoughts: An elegy, written in the King's Bench Prison\\", dating from 1816 and printed in 1821. In 1809, H. P. Houghton wrote An evening's contemplation in a French prison, being a humble imitation of Gray's Elegy while he was a prisoner at Arras during the Napoleonic wars (London 1809).Northup item 940 It was followed next year by the bitter Elegy in Newgate, published in The Satirist in the character of the recently imprisoned William Cobbett.Aug. 1, 1810, pp.159-164 An obvious distinction can be made between imitations meant to stand as independent works within the elegiac genre, not all of which followed Gray's wording closely, and those with a humorous or satirical purpose. The latter filled the columns in newspapers and comic magazines for the next century and a half. In 1884 some eighty of them were quoted in full or in part in Walter Hamilton's Parodies of the works of English and American authors (London 1884), more than those of any other work and further evidence of the poem's abiding influence.Vol.5 pp.1-48 One example uncollected there was the ingenious double parody of J. C. Squire, \\"If Gray had had to write his Elegy in the Cemetery of Spoon River instead of in that of Stoke Poges\\". This was an example of how later parodies shifted their critical aim, in this case \\"explicitly calling attention to the formal and thematic ties which connected the 18th century work with its 20th century derivation\\" in Edgar Lee Masters' work.Robert L. Mack, Thomas Gray: A Life, Yale University 2000, p. 25 Ambrose Bierce used parody of the poem for the same critical purpose in his definition of Elegy in The Devil's Dictionary, ending with the dismissive lines =Translations= The church at Stoke Poges; Gray's tomb is at the foot of the brick-built extension on the left While parody sometimes served as a special kind of translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray's ‚ÄúAnd all that beauty, all that wealth e‚Äôer gave‚Äù, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cyth√®re (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the thinnest relation to the original.The Spectator, 25 Dec 1875 The latest database of translations of the Elegy, amongst which the above version figures, records over 260 in some forty languages.Turk (2013) As well as the principal European languages and some of the minor such as Welsh, Breton and Icelandic, they include several in Asian languages as well. Through the medium of these, Romanticism was brought to the host literatures in Europe. In Asia they provided an alternative to tradition-bound native approaches and were identified as an avenue to modernism.Donald Keane, \\"The first Japanese translations of European literature‚Äù in The Blue-Eyed Tarakaja, Columbia University 2013, p.218 Study of the translations, and especially those produced soon after the poem was written, has highlighted some of the difficulties that the text presents.Garrison (2009) These include ambiguities of word order and the fact that certain languages do not allow the understated way in which Gray indicates that the poem is a personalised statement in the final line of the first stanza, ‚ÄúAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me‚Äù. Some of these problems disappeared when that translation was into Classical Latin, only to be replaced by others that Gray himself raised in correspondence with Christopher Anstey, one of the first of his translators into Latin. Anstey did not agree that Latin was as unpliable as Gray suggests and had no difficulty in finding ways of including all these references, although other Latin translators found different solutions, especially in regard to inclusion of the beetle.Garrison ch.4, ‚ÄúGray‚Äôs language and the languages of translation‚Äù, p.153ff. He similarly ignored Gray's suggestion in the same letter, referring back to his own alternative versions in earlier drafts of his poem: ‚ÄúMight not the English characters here be romanized? Virgil is just as good as Milton, and C√¶sar as Cromwell, but who shall be Hampden?‚Äù Again, however, other Latin translators, especially those from outside Britain, found Gray's suggested alternative more appealing. One other point, already mentioned, was how to deal with the problem of rendering the poem's fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, ‚Äú‚ÄôThat leaves the world to darkness and to me‚Äô is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.‚Äù In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly. In the same year that Anstey (and his friend William Hayward Roberts) were working on their Elegia Scripta in Coemeterio Rustico, Latine reddita (1762), another Latin version was published by Robert Lloyd with the title Carmen Elegiacum. Both were subsequently included in Irish collections of Gray‚Äôs poems, accompanied not only by John Duncombe‚Äôs ‚ÄúEvening Contemplation‚Äù, as noted earlier, but in the 1775 Dublin edition by translations from Italian sources as well. These included another Latin translation by Giovanni Costa and two into Italian by Abbate Crocci and Giuseppe Gennari. The pattern of including translations and imitations together continued into the 19th century with an 1806 bilingual edition in which a translation into French verse, signed simply L.D., appeared facing the English original page by page. However, the bulk of the book was made up of four English parodies. Duncombe's ‚ÄúEvening contemplation‚Äù was preceded by a parody of itself, ‚ÄúNocturnal contemplations in Barham Down‚Äôs Camp‚Äù, which is filled, like Duncombe's poem, with drunken roisterers disturbing the silence. Also included were Jerningham's ‚ÄúThe Nunnery‚Äù and J.T.R's ‚ÄúNightly thoughts in the Temple‚Äù, the latter set in the gated lawyer's quarter in London. Trilingual editions without such imitations were also appearing both in Britain and abroad. Gray‚Äôs Elegy in English, French and Latin was published from Croydon in 1788. The French author there was Pierre Gu√©don de Berch√®re and the Latin translator (like Gray and Anstey, a Cambridge graduate) was Gilbert Wakefield. In 1793 there was an Italian edition of Giuseppe Torelli's translation in rhymed quatrains which had first appeared in 1776. This was printed facing Gray's original and was succeeded by Melchiorre Cesarotti‚Äôs translation in blank verse and Giovanni Costa's Latin version, both of which dated from 1772. A French publication ingeniously followed suit by including the Elegy in an 1816 guide to the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, accompanied by Torelli's Italian translation and Pierre-Joseph Charrin‚Äôs free Le Cimeti√®re de village. Such publications were followed by multilingual collections, of which the most ambitious was Alessandro Torri's L'elegia di Tommaso Gray sopra un cimitero di campagna tradotta dall'inglese in pi√π lingue con varie cose finora inedite (Verona 1819). This included four translations into Latin, of which one was Christopher Anstey's and another was Costa's; eight into Italian, where versions in prose and terza rima accompanied those already mentioned by Torelli and Cesarotti; two in French, two in German and one each in Greek and Hebrew. Even more translations were eventually added in the new edition of 1843. By that time, too, John Martin's illustrated edition of 1839 had appeared with translations into Latin, Greek, German, Italian and French, of which only the Torelli version had appeared in previous collections. What we learn from all this activity is that, as the centenary of its first publication approached, interest in Gray's Elegy continued unabated in Europe and new translations of it continued to be made. =Other media= A woodcut to John Constable's design for stanza 3 of the Elegy Many editions of the Elegy have contained illustrations, some of considerable merit, such as those among the Designs by Mr. Bentley, for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray (1753). But the work of two leading artists is particularly noteworthy. Between 1777-8 William Blake was commissioned by John Flaxman to produce an illustrated set of Gray's poems as a birthday gift to his wife. These were in watercolour and included twelve for the Elegy, which appeared at the end of the volume.A facsimile is available on the Blake Archive Another individual book was created in 1910 by the illuminator Sidney Farnsworth, hand written in italic script with a mediaeval decorative surround and more modern-looking inset illustrations. Another notable illuminated edition had been created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page. Produced by chromolithography, each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed brown leather made to imitate carved wood.There is a facsimile on the Hathi Trust site A little earlier there had been a compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the \\"ivy-mantled tower\\" in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator leans on a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British Museum (see below). While not an illustration in itself, Christopher Nevinson‚Äôs statement against the slaughter of World War I in his painting Paths of Glory (1917) takes its title from another line in the Elegy, ‚ÄúThe paths of glory lead but to the grave‚Äù. The title had already been used two years before by Irvin S. Cobb in an account of his journalistic experiences at the start of that war.Paths of Glory, by Irvin S. Cobb. It was then taken up in the unrelated Humphrey Cobb's 1935 anti-war novel, although in this case the name was suggested for the untitled manuscript in a competition held by the publisher. His book also served in its turn as the basis for Stanley Kubrick‚Äôs film Paths of Glory, released in 1957. This example is just one more among many illustrating the imaginative currency that certain lines of the poem continue to have, over and above their original significance. Since the poem is long, there have been few musical settings. Musicians during the 1780s adopted the solution of selecting only a part. W.Tindal's musical setting for voices was of the \\"Epitaph\\" (1785),Northup item 531 which was perhaps the item performed as a trio after a recitation of the poem at the newly opened Royalty Theatre in London in 1787.Northup item 535 At about that time too, Stephen Storace set the first two stanzas in his ‚ÄúThe curfew tolls‚Äù for voice and keyboard, with a reprise of the first stanza at the end.A performance is on YouTube At the period there were guides for the dramatic performance of such pieces involving expressive hand gestures, and they included directions for this piece.Robert Toft, Bel Canto, a performer‚Äôs guide, Oxford University 2013, pp.171-6 There is also an item described as \\"Gray's Elegy set to music\\" in various settings for voice accompanied by harpsichord or harp by Thomas Billington (1754-1832), although this too may have only been an excerpt.It was severely reviewed in The European Magazine, 1784, Volume 5, p.370 A member of the theatrical world, Billington was noted as \\"fond of setting the more serious and gloomier passages in English verse‚ÄùA Biographical Dictionary of Actors, Actresses, Musicians, Dancers, Managers & Other Stage Personnel in London, 1660-1800, Volume 1, Southern Illinois University, 1973 p.129 In 1830, a well known composer of glees, George Hargreaves, set \\"Full many a gem\\", the Elegy's fourteenth stanza, for four voices.Northup item 589 And finally, at the other end of the century, Alfred Cellier did set the whole work in a cantata composed expressly for the Leeds Festival, 1883. The work was ‚Äúdedicated to Mrs Coleman of Stoke Park, in memory of some pleasant hours at the very spot where the scene of the elegy is supposed to be laid.‚Äù A nearly contemporary cantata was also composed by Gertrude E. Quinton as Musa elegeia: being a setting to music of Gray's Elegy (London, 1885). The only other example yet discovered of a translation of the Elegy set to music was the few lines rendered into German by Ella Backus Behr (1897‚Äì1928) in America.Turk p.57 Critical response Memorial at Stoke Poges dedicated to the elegy The immediate response to the final draft version of the poem was positive and Walpole was very pleased with the work. During the summer of 1750, Gray received so much positive support regarding the poem that he was in dismay, but did not mention it in his letters until an 18 December 1750 letter to Wharton. In the letter, Gray said, The poem was praised for its universal aspects, and Gray became one of the most famous English poets of his era. Despite this, after his death only his elegy remained popular until 20th- century critics began to re-evaluate his poetry. The 18th-century writer James Beattie was said by Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet to have written a letter to him claiming, \\"Of all the English poets of this age, Mr. Gray is most admired, and I think with justice; yet there are comparatively speaking but a few who know of anything of his, but his 'Church-yard Elegy,' which is by no means the best of his works.\\" There is a story that the British General James Wolfe read the poem before his troops arrived at the Plains of Abraham in September 1759 as part of the Seven Years' War. After reading the poem, he is reported to have said: \\"Gentlemen, I would rather have written those lines than take Quebec tomorrow.\\"Quoted in . Adam Smith, in his 21st lecture on rhetoric in 1763, argued that poetry should deal with \\"A temper of mind that differs very little from the common tranquillity of mind is what we can best enter into, by the perusal of a small piece of a small length ... an Ode or Elegy in which there is no odds but in the measure which differ little from the common state of mind are what most please us. Such is that on the Church yard, or Eton College by Mr Grey. The Best of Horaces (tho inferior to Mr Greys) are all of this sort.\\" Even Samuel Johnson, who knew Gray but did not like his poetry, later praised the poem when he wrote in his Life of Gray (1779) that it \\"abounds with images which find a mirror in every breast; and with sentiments to which every bosom returns an echo. The four stanzas beginning Yet even these bones, are to me original: I have never seen the notions in any other place; yet he that reads them here, persuades himself that he has always felt them.\\"Quoted in . Johnson's general criticism prompted many others to join in the debate. Some reviewers of his Lives of the Poets, and many of Gray's editors, thought that he was too harsh. An article in the Annual Register for 1782 recognised, with relation to the Elegy, \\"That the doctor was not over zealous to allow [Gray] the degree of praise that the public voice had universally assigned him, is, we think, sufficiently apparent\\"; but it went on to qualify this with the opinion that \\"partiality to [Gray's] beautiful elegy had perhaps allotted him a rank above his general merits.\\" Debate over Gray's work continued into the 19th century, and Victorian critics remained unconvinced by the rest of it. At the end of the century, Matthew Arnold, in his 1881 collection of critical writings, summed up the general response: \\"The Elegy pleased; it could not but please: but Gray's poetry, on the whole, astonished his contemporaries at first more than it pleased them; it was so unfamiliar, so unlike the sort of poetry in vogue.\\" In 1882, Edmund Gosse analyzed the reception of Gray's poem: \\"It is curious to reflect upon the modest and careless mode in which that poem was first circulated which was destined to enjoy and to retain a higher reputation in literature than any other English poem perhaps than any other poem of the world written between Milton and Wordsworth.\\" He continued by stressing the poem's wide acceptance: \\"The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe, from Denmark to Italy, from France to Russia. With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare, no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and after more than a century of existence we find it as fresh as ever, when its copies, even the most popular of all those of Lamartine, are faded and tarnished.\\". He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: \\"It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity, of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear, of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation, and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master. The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse, our poem of poems; not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in our language, but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities that go to the production of a fine poetical effect.\\" =20th-century response= John Constable's study for stanza 5, 1833 Critics at the beginning of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray \\"discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all the sadness of eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self.\\" I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: \\"poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listenersin view of what he has to sayis so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional.\\" He continued: \\"the Elegy may usefully remind us that boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their nearness to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults ... Gray, however, without overstressing any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph.\\" In the 1930s and 1940s, critics emphasised the content of the poem, and some felt that it fell short of what was necessary to make it truly great. In 1930, William Empson, while praising the form of the poem as universal, argued against its merits because of its potential political message. He claimed that the poem \\"as the context makes clear\\", means that \\"18th-century England had no scholarship system of carriere ouverte aux talents. This is stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it ... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities.\\"Quoted in . He continued: \\"the truism of the reflection in the churchyard, the universality and impersonality this gives to the style, claim as if by comparison that we ought to accept the injustice of society as we do the inevitability of death.\\"Quoted in . T. S. Eliot‚Äôs 1932 collection of essays contained a comparison of the elegy to the sentiment found in metaphysical poetry: \\"The feeling, the sensibility, expressed in the Country Churchyard (to say nothing of Tennyson and Browning) is cruder than that in the Coy Mistress.\\" Later, in 1947, Cleanth Brooks pointed out that \\"In Gray's poem, the imagery does seem to be intrinsically poetic; the theme, true; the 'statement', free from ambiguity, and free from irony.\\" After describing various aspects and complexities within the poem, Brooks provided his view on the poem's conclusion: \\"the reader may not be altogether convinced, as I am not altogether convinced, that the epitaph with which the poem closes is adequate. But surely its intended function is clear, and it is a necessary function if the poem is to have a structure and is not to be considered merely a loose collection of poetic passages.\\" Critics during the 1950s and 1960s generally regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place as one of the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, \\"At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and what he hoped for from eternity.\\" Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, \\"no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in.\\" Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was \\"perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English.\\" Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, \\"Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways.\\" Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that \\"For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem.\\" She continued by praising the poem: \\"Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable.\\" In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was \\"frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language.\\" During the 1970s, some critics pointed out how the lines of the poems were memorable and popular while others emphasised the poem's place in the greater tradition of English poetry. W. K. Wimsatt, in 1970, suggested, \\"Perhaps we shall be tempted to say only that Gray transcends and outdoes Hammond and Shenstone simply because he writes a more poetic line, richer, fuller, more resonant and memorable in all the ways in which we are accustomed to analyze the poetic quality.\\" In 1971, Charles Cudworth declared that the elegy was \\"a work which probably contains more famous quotations per linear inch of text than any other in the English language, not even excepting Hamlet.\\" When describing how Gray's Elegy is not a conventional elegy, Eric Smith added in 1977, \\"Yet, if the poem at so many points fails to follow the conventions, why are we considering it here? the answer is partly that no study of major English elegies could well omit it. But it is also, and more importantly, that in its essentials Gray's Elegy touches this tradition at many points, and consideration of them is of interest to both to appreciation of the poem and to seeing how [...] they become in the later tradition essential points of reference.\\" Also in 1977, Thomas Carper noted, \\"While Gray was a schoolboy at Eton, his poetry began to show a concern with parental relationships, and with his position among the great and lowly in the world [...] But in the Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard these longstanding and very human concerns have their most affecting expression.\\" In 1978, Howard Weinbrot noted, \\"With all its long tradition of professional examination the poem remains distant for many readers, as if the criticism could not explain why Johnson thought that \\"The Church-yard abounds with images that find a mirrour in every mind\\". He continued by arguing that it is the poem's discussion of morality and death that is the source of its \\"enduring popularity\\". By the 1980s, critics emphasised the power of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, \\"The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion.\\" Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, \\"ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal ... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster.\\" Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, \\"What moves me most about the superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's ... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in- life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self.\\" In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a \\"poet's poet\\" and places him \\"within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language\\" declared that in \\"the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind has felt itself to be directly addressed by a very sympathetic, human voice.\\" He later pointed out: \\"Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language.\\" Modern critics emphasised the poem's use of language as a reason for its importance and popularity. In 1995, Lorna Clymer argued, \\"The dizzying series of displacements and substitutions of subjects, always considered a crux in Thomas Gray's \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\" (1751), results from a complex manipulation of epitaphic rhetoric.\\" Later, Robert Mack, in 2000, explained that \\"Gray's Elegy is numbered high among the very greatest poems in the English tradition precisely because of its simultaneous accessibility and inscrutability.\\" He went on to claim that the poem \\"was very soon to transform his life ‚Äì and to transform or at least profoundly affect the development of lyric poetry in English\\". While analyzing the use of \\"death\\" in 18th-century poetry, David Morris, in 2001, declared the poem as \\"a monument in this ongoing transformation of death\\" and that \\"the poem in its quiet portraits of rural life succeeds in drawing the forgotten dead back into the community of the living.\\" References Bibliography    (Trans.

Biography Commonly known as \\"Charlie\\", C. K. Jones was born in Newcastle and was educated at Cooks Hill High School to the equivalent of 7th grade. He then completed an apprenticeship in boilermaking at the BHP steelworks and Newcastle Technical College. He married Doreen Wright in 1939. He first became politically active as a member of the Boilermakers Union and, subsequently, the various metal trade unions. In the early 1940s he became a union official and a delegate to the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. He was elected to the Newcastle City Council in 1946, and in 1956, at the age of 39, became the youngest Lord Mayor of Newcastle, a position he held until he was elected to the Division of Newcastle at the 1958 election. He held the seat until he retired in 1983. In the Federal Australian Labor Party, he was associated with the Left faction and was a close associate of Jim Cairns and Tom Uren. He became the shadow minister for Transport and Civil Aviation following Labor's crushing defeat at the 1966 election. Charlie Jones was commissioned as a minister with the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972 and served as the Minister for Transport until that government was dismissed on 11 November 1975. Despite Newcastle's status as a Labor bastion (it has been in Labor hands since Federation), Jones is the only person in the seat's history to have been promoted to cabinet. During this period, Jones attempted to improve the co- ordination of Australia's transport systems. Under the Australian constitution, intrastate transport is a responsibility of the various state governments. Consequently, Australian transport had a significant degree of systemic inefficiency. Jones proposed a model urban train carriage that could be used in the train systems of the major capitals and also attempted to inaugurate an Inter-State Commission as proposed by Section 101 of the Australian Constitution. He was involved in providing air services to Papua New Guinea when that nation became independent in 1975. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to politics and government in the 1984 Australia Day Honours list. In 2001 he was presented with a Centenary Medal for service to the Australian community.

Alexander Samoylov was born into the family of senator Nikolay Samoylov. He started his military service in 1760 as a soldier of Leib-Guard Semyonovsky Regiment. Later he was moved to the front-line forces and took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768‚Äì1774 and, for his part in the taking of Silistra, received the Order of St. George of 4th degree. The rise to power of his relative, Prince Potemkin, led to a comital title being bestowed upon Samoilov in 1775. After that, he obtained quick promotion: in 1775 he was appointed a member of commission for the trial of Yemelyan Pugachev. Also he was promoted to kamer- yunker (cadet) and became the chairman of the Council, which existed in the reign of Catherine II in 1776‚Äì1787. In 1783 he commanded the Crimean Chasseur Corps and was prominent in the campaign that led to the Russian annexation of the Crimean Khanate. During the Russo-Turkish War, 1787‚Äì1792 he fought as General-Poruchik, commanding five infantry regiments, two corps of chasseurs, seven Cossack regiments and forty cannons. In 1788 he distinguished himself in the taking of Ochakov and was awarded the Order of St. George of 2nd degree. In 1789 he took part in the taking of Bendery and Kaushan, serving under his relative, Prince Potemkin. For this campaign he received the Order of Alexander Nevsky. On 12 December 1790, he commanded the left wing of the army of Alexander Suvorov in the storm of Izmail, winning the Order of St. Vladimir of 1st degree. For his efforts in bringing about the peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire, Catherine II personally decorated him with the Order of St. Andrew. On 17 September 1792, he was appointed General-Prosecutor of the Senate instead of seriously ill Prince Alexander Vyazemsky. Upon his accession to the throne, Emperor Paul I dismissed Samoylov. Alexander Samoilov married Princess Troubetzkoy and had one son, Nicholas, who did not leave issue from his marriage to the last Countess Skavronsky, Yulia. General Raevsky was his nephew.

Population: History Though not attested in any document, the town of Kozmodemyansk was likely preceded by a Mari wooden fortress controlling the confluence of the Volga and the Vetluga Rivers. It was also an important resting and trading place for traders from the North who traveled along the river to Volga Bulgaria. The Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria was a serious blow to the region. Kozmodemyansk was founded by Tsar Ivan the Terrible in 1583 after his conquest of Kazan in 1552 and the Cheremis Wars in 1553-1557, 1582, and 1592 as a frontier fortress to guard the new border of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The fortress was named after Sts. Cosmas and Damian. For many years the streltsy fortress was the only building in the area. Streltsy Chapel (1698) As commerce along the Volga developed, a town gradually grew around the fortress, but the region remained largely populated by the Mari people. The town had a fair specializing in wooden and wicker ware goods produced by local craftsmen. The town was very active during summer, but winters brought a halt to river traffic. In the 19th century, Kozmodemyansk was a more important trading place along the Volga than the neighboring towns of Vasilsursk and Cheboksary. It was a typical halfway \\"overnight\\" stop for the Volga River steamers between Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan. In the 20th century, the town developed industrially. According to the official Imperial Russian statistics, on January 1 (14), 1913, the population was 5,500, of which 97.5% were Russians. In 1918, there was a dispute between Mari and Chuvash representatives of Kozmodemyansk in the Idel-Ural Movement. It was not decided to which proposed state (Mariland or Chuvashia) the town, as well as the surrounding countryside, should be merged. A few rare mentions which have remained show that the Volga was to become the border between Chuvashia and Mariland, with considerable cultural and political autonomy (after the example of the status of the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire) given to the Hill Mari minority on the south side of the Volga in Chuvashia (according to the preserved papers from the Meeting of Representatives of the Minority Peoples on May 15, 1917 and Idel-Ural State].

A regional museum to preserve artifacts of the Mari culture was opened in 1979. An open-air ethnographic museum opened in 1983. It contains over sixty varied buildings typical of Russian/Mari culture. They house over 2,000 exhibits of artisan craft and tools. Even the variety of fences around the grounds display typical Mari designs.

It lay west of Wolverhampton and was formed under the Local Government Act 1894 based on the Seisdon rural sanitary district.Seisdon Rural District at Vision of Britain . Accessed 31 January 2006. Villages in the district included Kinver, Wombourne, Codsall, Trysull and Pattingham. In 1933, it was expanded to absorb the northern section of Kingswinford rural district, with the southern, more urban section of the district being absorbed into Brierley Hill. At the same time, a section of Penn was removed from Seisdon to be incorporated into Wolverhampton. A year later, part of the district was absorbed into Tettenhall. In 1966, the village of Gospel End was transferred into Seisdon having previously been part of Sedgley. This reorganisation also involved a section of Brierley Hill being removed from Seisdon and, along with the bulk of Sedgley and Brierley Hill, being placed into an enlarged Dudley borough. It continued in existence until 1 April 1974, when it was merged with the southern part of Cannock Rural District to form the South Staffordshire district.HMSO.

This colorless, viscous liquid is a carboxylic acid with an acrid unpleasant odor. It is soluble in warm water and miscible with most organic solvents. Methacrylic acid is produced industrially on a large scale as a precursor to its esters, especially methyl methacrylate (MMA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). MAA occurs naturally in small amounts in the oil of Roman chamomile. Production In the most common route, methacrylic acid is prepared from acetone cyanohydrin, which is converted to methacrylamide sulfate using sulfuric acid. This derivative in turn is hydrolyzed to methacrylic acid, or esterified to methyl methacrylate in one step. In the second route, isobutylene or tert-butanol are oxidized to methacrolein, then methacrylic acid. Methacrolein for this purpose can also be obtained from formaldehyde and ethylene. Isobutyric acid can also be dehydrogenated to methacrylic acid. It can also be prepared by decarboxylation of itaconic acid, citraconic acid, and mesaconic acid. Such green precursors are not of commercial value. It is, however, obtained by boiling citra- or meso-brompyrotartaric acids with alkalis. Uses Methacrylic acid is used in some nail primers to help acrylic nails adhere to the nail plate. Reactions Methacrylic acid was first obtained in the form of its ethyl ester by treating phosphorus pentachloride with oxyisobutyric ester (A synonym for beta-hydroxy-butyric acid or 3-hydroxybutyric acidhttps://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/oxybutyric%20acid) .Edward Frankland Annalen, 1865, 136, p. 12 When fused with an alkali, it forms propanoic acid.

He is based in London and Brussels. Personal life The son of an international lawyer (who formulated laws that enable containers to go round the world), he was raised in Nigeria, the Sudan and Kenya before being sent to the Jesuit Catholic boarding school Stonyhurst College in the UK. Although his father moved to Northern Ireland and his mother to Germany after divorcing, most of Awde's teenage home life was spent in Soho and the West End of London. He studied Arabic and Hausa at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, later becoming a journalist after working for several years on building sites and teaching English in Spain. Plays and fiction With Chris Bartlett he co-wrote the comedy drama Pete and Dud: Come Again, a hit at the Assembly Rooms at the Edinburgh Festival in August 2005 before transferring to London's West End at The Venue, in March 2006, then doing a 90-date tour of the UK the following year. The play examines the comic relationship that existed between comedians Peter Cook and Dudley Moore of Beyond the Fringe; set in a chat show during the early eighties, the play tells their tale from the perspective of Dudley Moore, by then an international film star. In 2007 two other plays followed, premiering at the Edinburgh Festival. Written with Chris Bartlett, directed by David Giles and starring Jessica Martin and Jason Wood, Unnatural Acts is a comedy about two flatmates, a gay man and a straight woman, who try to have a baby together. Written by Awde and directed by Jon Bonfiglio, Blood Confession is a violent drama about an interrogation, about a child murder from 25 years ago, that goes horribly wrong. In 1993, Awde wrote, composed and produced Andrew Lloyd Webber The Musical, described as \\"a bizarre mix of spoof and satire\\" by The Virgin Encyclopedia of Stage & Film Musicals. A pastiche of the life of top musical composer Lloyd Webber, in loving homage to Mel Brooks' The Producers, it ran in a variety of fringe venues across London with several casts. Awde's 1994 follow-up Margaret Thatcher: The Musical failed to find backing. Awde's other stage works are Eros and the Skull (Bloomsbury Theatre, London, 1988) ‚Äì a multi-created one-man show about the French poet Baudelaire ‚Äì and Semtex & Lipstick (King's Head Theatre, London, 1992) ‚Äì a drama for actor and actress about love and political torture. He also co-designed costumes for historical drama Tewodros (Arts Theatre, 1987). In 2003 he published his first novel, The Virgin Killers, as part of The Public School Chronicles series. It is a thriller about murders of priests at a Catholic prep school in the wilds of Lancashire that lead to a trail of Jesuit and Freemason conspiracies deep within the British Establishment. He has been a theatre critic since the early 1990s, and has been writing for The Stage newspaper for most of that time. Together with Gerald Berkowitz, in 1999 he set up theatreguidelondon.co.uk. He worked on The Voice during a key period of the fight for black empowerment in the UK, frequently with immediate impact, as when he wrote a front-page headline that contributed to a riot in Brixton the following day and attempted siege of the local police station.1995 Brixton riot; Andy Beckett, 'The Voice in the Wilderness', The Independent, 11 February 1996. As an illustrator and cartoonist, over the years he has worked for newspapers such as The Voice and The Weekly Journal ‚Äì where he was the regular profile illustrator for several years ‚Äì City Limits and The Guardian newspaper. His cartoons also illustrate comedian Llewella Gideon's The Little Big Woman Book. He has done illustration work for Spanish educational publishers and has run a wide range of cartoon strips in specialist publications such as Boogie (music press, Spain), London Student, Untitled, The Wharf and The Stage. Music =Desert Hearts= Hill's rock group Desert Hearts initially operated as a rock three-piece that also played under the name of Dr Wu in 1990 before becoming a more complex four-piece in 1991 with Awde on vocals, guitar and violin, Andy Matthews on bass and vocals, Leo Katana on guitars, plus a string of drummers. Dropping the Dr Wu tag, Awde went into the studio in 1993 to produce sessions with Andy Ward ‚Äì Awde provided vocals and played all other instruments ‚Äì guitars, bass, keyboards and violin. Sub-titled 'Love Songs from the Underground', 1996's I Saw Satan on the Northern Line was released as a 'CD without music'. Designed in the format of a CD lyrics booklet, it contains often comic observations on modern life. The band came out of hibernation in 2010 with the release of Close to the Edge B/W Rocket Man/Meryl Streep, a mini album laced with Mellotron keyboard arrangements. =MelloFest= November 2008 saw the first MelloFest take place at the Fiddler's Elbow in Kentish Town, London. Organised by Awde, MelloFest One featured two Mellotrons onstage along with discussions and live Mellotron-inspired music from guests, plus the official launch of Awde's book Mellotron. Talking about their music and in some cases also playing it were: David Cross (King Crimson), Nick Magnus (Steve Hackett Band), Martin Orford (IQ), Jakko Jakszyk (21st Century Schizoid Band/Tangent/Level 42), Dave Cousins (Strawbs) & Robert Kirby (Strawbs/Nick Drake/Paul Weller), Robert Webb (England) and Tony Clarke, producer of the Moody Blues. A more concert-based second MelloFest Two, complete with three Mellotrons onstage and a Stylophone, took place at The Luminaire in London on 2 May 2009 featuring Clarke, Orford, Webb, Maggie Alexander, Mark Rae, Andy Thompson and a virtual appearance from Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater demonstrating the new Ellatron iPod/iPhone Mellotron app. MelloFest Three is the Nick Awde & Desert Hearts EP Close to the Edge, released in early 2010. MelloFest Four will be the band's follow-up album MelloRetro. MelloFest Six is 2011's A Christmas Carol Unplugged at the Union Chapel, north London, a music biz update of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol arranged by Awde, written by Chris Bartlett and starring Noddy Holder of Slade. Musicians appearing in the show at the Union Chapel, north London, are Robert Webb, Simon Scardanelli, Andy Thompson, Knox of The Vibrators, Marc Atkinson, Grace Solero and member of parliament and deputy transport minister Norman Baker. The stage director is Saul Reichlin. Academic work As Nicholas Awde, Hill has written or edited books on non- European languages and cultures, including a Chechen Phrasebook, a Georgian Phrasebook, Women in Islam: An Anthology from the Qur'an and Hadiths, An Illustrated History of Islam and an Arabic Dictionary. He has written three other dictionaries for Swahili, Serbo-Croatian and Hausa, as well as 15-plus dictionary-phrasebooks. He has commissioned many authors, particularly from the Caucasus, editing and designing their books for other publishers. He is also a long-standing consultant on the Caucasus, and, with Fred James Hill, runs the publishing companies Bennett & Bloom (academic) and Desert Hearts (general arts).

Although officially two streets, local people seldom make distinction between them. They are separated by the Mong Kok Police Station. Sai Yeung Choi Street South is a popular hotspot for shopping and a tourist attraction. History The streets were built on watercress cultivation in a village, Mong Kok Tsuen (Êó∫ËßíÊùë), in Mong Kok in 1924. The name Sai Yeung Choi is the Chinese name of watercress. As time went by, the village and fields were replaced by high-rise buildings.Qizhang Dong, Atlas: The Archaeology of an Imaginary City (Columbia University Press, 2013), , c. 38. Excerpts available at Google Books. When the police station was built, the street was separated into two sections. In the late 1970s the Postmaster General suggested renaming the streets, appending \\"south\\" and \\"north\\", to reduce confusion. On 12 January 1979 the streets were renamed. In the 1970s, some buildings on Sai Yeung Choi Street were demolished to make way for construction of the Mass Transit Railway. Sai Yeung Choi Street has been the site of several criminal acts of objects and fluids being thrown from buildings. On 13 December 2008, two bottles of corrosive liquid were hurled from buildings, burning 46 people. On 16 May 2009 two bottles of corrosive liquid were thrown, injuring 30 people. The police increased the award for information leading to an arrest, while the Yau Tsim Mong District Council installed a CCTV system to help catch the perpetrator. A third acid attack occurred on 8 June 2009, injuring 24. A similar attack occurred on 9 January 2010 on nearby Temple Street. On 10 June 2014, a pedestrian was killed on Sai Yeung Choi Street after being hit by a swivel chair thrown from a rooftop by a mentally-ill Mainland Chinese who had been drinking. Sai Yeung Choi Street was a frequent site of demonstrations during the protracted 2014 Hong Kong protests. Sai Yeung Choi Street South Sai Yeung Choi Street South at night in 2008 Starting from Dundas Street in Yau Ma Tei, it runs north and meets major roads, Argyle Street and Mong Kok Road, and ends at the junction with Prince Edward Road West. This street is a hot spot for Hong Kong people. The section south of Argyle Street concentrates shops of electronic products at street level and upstair bookstores above. The busiest portion of the street was pedestrianised all week long in 2000. However, the Traffic and Transport Committee of the Yau Tsim Mong District Council voted on 21 November 2013 to restrict the pedestrianisation to weekends and public holidays only, citing complaints from local residents. A survey conducted by the Home Affairs Department found that 80 per cent of residents and shop owners wanted to limit pedestrianisation, while most people questioned on the street wanted to keep the weekday pedestrianisation. In spite of criticism, the pedestrianisation hours were reduced to weekends only with effect from January 2014. The section of the street between Argyle Street and Dundas Street was closed to motorised traffic from 4:00 pm to 10:00 pm on Saturdays, and noon to 10:00 pm on Sundays and public holidays. Retail rents on the street subsequently dropped. The noise of street performers has increasingly become a point of contention at Sai Yeung Choi Street South, as at certain other locations in Hong Kong (e.g. Tuen Mun Park). As such public singing and dancing is common in Mainland Chinese squares and parks, Hong Kong media have called the phenomenon an example of the \\"mainlandisation\\" of Hong Kong. The \\"often-off-key singing blasting from the loudspeakers\\" is considered excessively loud and lacking in artistic merit. A study commissioned by the Liberal Party found that noise levels on Saturday nights reached 101.5 decibels. In 2017, authorities received more than 1,200 complaints about the performers, who are not managed by any licensing or regulatory system. In response to pressure from residents and businesses, the Yau Tsim Mong District Council voted in May 2018 to temporarily suspend the pedestrianisation scheme, and the pedestrian zone ceased to exist at 10pm on 29 July 2018. Sai Yeung Choi Street North Starting from Playing Field Road, it runs north, crossing Boundary Street into New Kowloon and terminates slight beyond Poplar Street. This street is largely residential and more quiet than the other street in the south. A much shorter, separated section of this street is to the north, between Sai Yeung Choi Lane and St. Francis' Church, separated by a hill slope.

As for the first meaning, the artificial neurons and synapses in hybrid networks can be digital or analog. For the digital variant voltage clamps are used to monitor the membrane potential of neurons, to computationally simulate artificial neurons and synapses and to stimulate biological neurons by inducing synaptic. For the analog variant, specially designed electronic circuits connect to a network of living neurons through electrodes. As for the second meaning, incorporating elements of symbolic computation and artificial neural networks into one model was an attempt to combine the advantages of both paradigms while avoiding the shortcomings. Symbolic representations have advantages with respect to explicit, direct control, fast initial coding, dynamic variable binding and knowledge abstraction. Representations of artificial neural networks, on the other hand, show advantages for biological plausibility, learning, robustness (fault- tolerant processing and graceful decay), and generalization to similar input. Since the early 1990s many attempts have been made to reconcile the two approaches.

The last commercial Gen I power reactor was located at the Wylfa Nuclear Power Station and ceased operation at the end of 2015. The nomenclature for reactor designs, describing four 'generations', was proposed by the US Department of Energy when it introduced the concept of generation IV reactors. The designation generation II+ reactor is sometimes used for modernized generation II designs built post-2000, such as the Chinese CPR-1000, in competition with more expensive generation III reactor designs. Typically, the modernization includes improved safety systems and a 60-year design life. Generation II reactor designs generally had an original design life of 30 or 40 years. This date was set as the period over which loans taken out for the plant would be paid off. However, many generation II reactors are being life-extended to 50 or 60 years, and a second life-extension to 80 years may also be economic in many cases. By 2013 about 75% of still operating U.S. reactors had been granted life extension licenses to 60 years. Chernobyl's No.4 reactor that exploded was a generation II reactor, specifically RBMK-1000. Fukushima Daiichi's three destroyed reactors were generation II reactors; specifically Mark I Boiling water reactors (BWR) designed by General Electric. In 2016, unit 2 at the Watts Bar Nuclear Generating Station came online and is likely to be the last generation II reactor to become operational in the United States.

Dormant seeds do not germinate in a specified period of time under a combination of environmental factors that are normally conducive to the germination of non-dormant seeds. An important function of seed dormancy is delayed germination, which allows dispersal and prevents simultaneous germination of all seeds. The staggering of germination safeguards some seeds and seedlings from suffering damage or death from short periods of bad weather or from transient herbivores; it also allows some seeds to germinate when competition from other plants for light and water might be less intense. Another form of delayed seed germination is seed quiescence, which is different from true seed dormancy and occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are too dry or warm or cold for germination. Many species of plants have seeds that delay germination for many months or years, and some seeds can remain in the soil seed bank for more than 50 years before germination. Some seeds have a very long viability period, and the oldest documented germinating seed came from a study done from tissue buried in Siberian permafrost. Seeds of silene stenophylla, was estimated to be 31,800 years old and researchers regenerated the plant successfully. Overview True dormancy or innate dormancy is caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination under normally ideal conditions. Often seed dormancy is divided into two major categories based on what part of the seed produces dormancy: exogenous and endogenous.Different Types of Seed Dormancy  Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens There are three types of dormancy based on their mode of action: physical, physiological and morphological. There have been a number of classification schemes developed to group different dormant seeds, but none have gained universal usage. Dormancy occurs because of a wide range of reasons that often overlap, producing conditions in which definitive categorization is not clear. Compounding this problem is that the same seed that is dormant for one reason at a given point may be dormant for another reason at a later point. Some seeds fluctuate from periods of dormancy to non dormancy, and despite the fact that a dormant seed appears to be static or inert, in reality they are still receiving and responding to environmental cues. Exogenous dormancy Exogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo and is often broken down into three subgroups: =Physical dormancy= Dormancy caused by an impermeable seed coat is known as physical dormancy. Physical dormancy is the result of impermeable layer(s) that develops during maturation and drying of the seed or fruit.Offord, C.A. and Meagher, P.F. (2009). Plant germplasm conservation in Australia: strategies and guidelines for developing,managing and utilising ex situ collections. Canberra: Australian Network for Plant Conservation Inc. This impermeable layer prevents the seed from taking up water or gases. As a result, the seed is prevented from germinating until dormancy is broken. In natural systems, physical dormancy is broken by several factors including high temperatures, fluctuating temperatures, fire, freezing/thawing, drying or passage through the digestive tracts of animals. Physical dormancy is believed to have developed >100 mya. Once physical dormancy is broken it cannot be reinstated (i.e. the seed is unable to enter secondary dormancy following unfavourable conditions unlike seeds with physiological dormancy mechanismsBaskin C.C. and Baskin J.M. (1998). Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination. San Diego: Academic Press). Therefore, the timing of the mechanisms that breaks physical dormancy is critical and must be tuned to environmental cues. This maximises the chances for germination occurring in conditions where the plant will successfully germinate, establish and eventually reproduce. Physical dormancy has been identified in the seeds of plants across 16 angiosperm families including: *Anacardiaceae *Asteraceae *Bixaceae *Cannaceae (monocot) *Cistaceae *Cochlospermaceae *Convolvulaceae *Cucurbitaceae *Dipterocarpaceae *Geraniaceae *Legumeinosae *Malvaceae *Nelumbonaceae *Rhamnaceae *Sarcolaenaceae *Sapindaceae Physical dormancy has not been recorded in any gymnosperms Generally, physical dormancy is the result of one or more palisade layers in the fruit or seed coat. These layers are lignified with malpighian cells tightly packed together and impregnated with water-repellent. In the families Anacardiaceae and Nelumbonaceae the seed coat is not well developed. Therefore, palisade layers in the fruit perform the functional role of preventing water uptake . While physical dormancy is a common feature, several species in these families do not have physical dormancy or produce non-dormant seeds. Specialised structures, which function as a \\"water-gap\\", are associated with the impermeable layers of the seed to prevent the uptake of water. The water-gap is closed at seed maturity and is opened in response to the appropriate environmental signal. Breaking physical dormancy involves the disruption of these specialised structures within the seed, and acts as an environmental signal detector for germination. For example, legume (Fabaceae) seeds become permeable after the thin-walled cells of lens (water-gap structure). Following disrupted pulls apart to allow water entry into the seed.Other water gap structures include carpellary micropyle, bixoid chalazal plug, imbibition lid and the suberised 'stopper'. In nature, the seed coats of physically dormant seeds are thought to become water permeable over time through repeated heating and cooling over many months-years in the soil seedbank. For example, the high and fluctuating temperatures during the dry season in northern Australia promote dormancy break in impermeable seeds of Stylosanthes humilis and S.hamata (Fabaceae). =Mechanical dormancy= Mechanical dormancy when seed coats or other coverings are too hard to allow the embryo to expand during germination. In the past this mechanism of dormancy was ascribed to a number of species that have been found to have endogenous factors for their dormancy instead. These endogenous factors include low embryo growth potential.Exogenous Dormancy  Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens =Chemical dormancy= Includes growth regulators etc., that are present in the coverings around the embryo. They may be leached out of the tissues by washing or soaking the seed, or deactivated by other means. Other chemicals that prevent germination are washed out of the seeds by rainwater or snow melt. Endogenous dormancy Endogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, and it is also often broken down into three subgroups: physiological dormancy, morphological dormancy and combined dormancy, each of these groups may also have subgroups. =Physiological dormancy= Physiological dormancy prevents embryo growth and seed germination until chemical changes occur. Physiological dormancy is indicated when an increase in germination rate occurs after an application of gibberellic acid (GA3) or after Dry after-ripening or dry storage. It is also indicated when dormant seed embryos are excised and produce healthy seedlings: or when up to 3 months of cold (0‚Äì10 ¬∞C) or warm (=15 ¬∞C) stratification increases germination: or when dry after-ripening shortens the cold stratification period required. In some seeds physiological dormancy is indicated when scarification increases germination.Physiological Dormancy  Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens Physiological dormancy is broken when inhibiting chemicals are broken down or are no longer produced by the seed; often by a period of cool moist conditions, normally below (+4C) 39F, or in the case of many species in Ranunculaceae and a few others,(‚àí5C) 24F. Abscisic acid is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds and its production can be affected by light. Some plants like Peony species have multiple types of physiological dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. *Drying; some plants including a number of grasses and those from seasonally arid regions need a period of drying before they will germinate, the seeds are released but need to have a lower moisture content before germination can begin. If the seeds remain moist after dispersal, germination can be delayed for many months or even years. Many herbaceous plants from temperate climate zones have physiological dormancy that disappears with drying of the seeds. *Photodormancy or light sensitivity affects germination of some seeds. These photoblastic seeds need a period of darkness or light to germinate. In species with thin seed coats, light may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil. *Thermodormancy is seed sensitivity to heat or cold. Some seeds including cocklebur and amaranth germinate only at high temperatures (30C or 86F). Many plants that have seeds that germinate in early to mid summer have thermodormancy and germinate only when the soil temperature is warm. Other seeds need cool soils to germinate, while others like celery are inhibited when soil temperatures are too warm. Often thermodormancy requirements disappear as the seed ages or dries. Seeds are classified as having deep physiological dormancy under these conditions: applications of GA3 does not increase germination; or when excised embryos produce abnormal seedlings; or when seeds require more than 3 months of cold stratification to germinate. =Morphological dormancy= In morphological dormancy, the embryo is underdeveloped or undifferentiated. Some seeds have fully differentiated embryos that need to grow more before seed germination, or the embryos are not differentiated into different tissues at the time of fruit ripening. *Immature embryos ‚Äì some plants release their seeds before the tissues of the embryos have fully differentiated, and the seeds ripen after they take in water while on the ground, germination can be delayed from a few weeks to a few months. =Combined dormancy= These seeds have both morphological and physiological dormancy. * Morpho-physiological or morphophysiological dormancy occurs when seeds with underdeveloped embryos, also have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds therefore require dormancy-breaking treatments as well as a period of time to develop fully grown embryos. * Intermediate simple * Deep simple * Deep simple epicotyl * Deep simple double * Intermediate complex * Deep complex Combinational dormancy Combinational dormancy occurs in some seeds, where dormancy is caused by both exogenous (physical) and endogenous (physiological) conditions.Combinational dormancy. www.uky.eduThe Seed Biology Place ‚Äì Seed Dormancy Some Iris species have both hard impermeable seeds coats and physiological dormancy. Secondary dormancy Secondary dormancy occurs in some non-dormant and post dormant seeds that are exposed to conditions that are not favorable for germination, like high temperatures. It is caused by conditions that occur after the seed has been dispersed. The mechanisms of secondary dormancy are not yet fully understood but might involve the loss of sensitivity in receptors in the plasma membrane.Bewley, J. Derek, and Michael Black. 1994. Seeds physiology of development and germination. The language of science. New York: Plenum Press. page 230. Not all seeds undergo a period of dormancy, many species of plants release their seeds late in the year when the soil temperature is too low for germination or when the environment is dry. If these seeds are collected and sown in an environment that is warm enough, and/or moist enough, they will germinate. Under natural conditions non dormant seeds released late in the growing season wait until spring when the soil temperature rises or in the case of seeds dispersed during dry periods until it rains and there is enough soil moisture. Seeds that do not germinate because they have fleshy fruits that retard germination are quiescent, not dormant. Many garden plants have seeds that will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough, though their wild ancestors had dormancy. These cultivated plants lack seed dormancy because of generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners that grew and kept plants that lacked dormancy. Seeds of some mangroves are viviparous and begin to germinate while still attached to the parent; they produce a large, heavy root, which allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls.Viviparous germination is an adaptation of mangroves for saline environment.

As of 2006 its members are located in London, Manchester and Belfast. The band's sound is characteristic of the British C86 movement with heavy use of jangling Rickenbacker 12-string guitars, airy female vocals and bright pop melodies. Language of Flowers Mk1 (1992) Language of Flowers Mk1 started out in 1992 when friends Colm McCrory (bass guitar) and Marc McCourt (guitar) hastily assembled a band with their friend Jeff Lynas on vocals to support the twee pop band Heavenly after they had booked them to play in Derry, Northern Ireland. This initial incarnation of the band split up immediately after their first gig (which included a cover of Velocity Girl by Primal Scream) after Heavenly's singer Amelia Fletcher compared their shambolic sound to riot grrrl band Huggy Bear, quite the opposite of the poppy, melodic Sarah Records influenced style they were aiming for. They would not play again for over 10 years. Language of Flowers Mk2 (2003‚Äì2007) In 2003 Marc and Colm decided to reform the band after mutual friends Ashton Cameron and Tara Simpson had toyed with the idea of starting a Field Mice influenced band. With Tara taking up vocal duties and Ashton on rhythm guitar they began searching for a drummer around Belfast. After exhausting the local area, Colm turned to Bentley Cooke, with whom he shared a flat with whilst living in Leicester in the mid-1990s but who was based in Manchester, England. After recording a 4 track demo the band quickly signed to Shelflife and released their debut album Songs About You in 2004. The album was well received by international fanzines with reviews noting the band's classic indie pop influences from the aforementioned bands Field Mice and Heavenly as well as The Smiths, Comet Gain, The Go- Betweens and Lush. The band spent 2005-2006 playing across the UK with other indie pop bands Camera Obscura, Trembling Blue Stars, Malcolm Middleton and Pipas as well as touring around Northern Europe.

Manetti was the son of a wealthy merchant. His public career began in 1429. He participated in municipal government as a member of the advisory council, as an ambassador, and in various gubernatorial positions in the city. Manetti was an eyewitness of the dedication of Santa Maria del Fiore on 25 March 1436, of which he left a record, the Oratio de Secularibus et Pontificalibus Pompis in Consecratione Basilicae Florentinae. His views on Florentine relations with Venice proved unpopular among the ruling class, and he put himself into voluntary exile, spending the last years of his life in Naples.Martines, Lauro (2011). The Social World of the Florentine Humanists, 1390-1460. University of Toronto Press. p. 7. He was a Latinist and a translator of Greek; he also studied Hebrew so that he could read the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinic commentaries. These readings convinced him that the Bible needed translation anew from the early manuscripts. After his death, Manetti's sizable library found its way into the Biblioteca Vaticana. As an author, Manetti's style was an imitation of Cicero. He is now remembered principally as the author of De dignitate et excellentia hominis libri IV (\\"On the Dignity and Excellence of Man in Four Books\\"), completed in manuscript in 1452 or 1453. It was a response to Pope Innocent III's De miseria humane conditionis. His Pistoiese History, composed in 1446‚Äì47, was the first contemporary critical response to Leonardo Bruni's innovative and monumental History of the Florentine People. He also wrote a commentary on Aristotle and biographies of Dante Alighieri, Giovanni Boccaccio, Pope Nicholas V, Francesco Petrarca, Seneca, and Socrates. Manetti's circle of humanist intellectuals included Carlo Marsuppini, Poggio Bracciolini, Leonardo Bruni, Francesco Filelfo, Niccol√≤ Niccoli, Palla Strozzi, and Lorenzo Valla.

(or Thorowgood and Besley) of London, a letter foundry often known as the Fann Street Foundry. The original Clarendon design is credited to Robert Besley, a partner in the foundry, and was originally engraved by punchcutter Benjamin Fox, who may also have contributed to its design. Many copies, adaptations and revivals have been released, becoming almost an entire genre of type design. Clarendons have a bold, solid structure, similar in letter structure to the \\"modern\\" serif typefaces popular in the nineteenth century for body text (for instance showing an 'R' with a curled leg and ball terminals on the 'a' and 'c'), but bolder and with less contrast in stroke weight. Clarendon designs generally have a structure with bracketed serifs, which become larger as they reach the main stroke of the letter. Mitja Miklavƒçiƒç describes the basic features of Clarendon designs (and ones labelled Ionic, often quite similar) as: \\"plain and sturdy nature, strong bracketed serifs, vertical stress, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders, typeface with little contrast\\" and supports Nicolete Gray's description of them as a \\"cross between the roman [general-purpose body text type] and slab serif model\\". Gray notes that nineteenth-century Ionic and Clarendon faces have \\"a definite differentiation between the thick and the thin strokes\\", unlike some other more geometric slab-serifs. Slab serif typefaces had become popular in British lettering and printing over the previous thirty-five years before the original Clarendon's release, both for display use on signage, architectural lettering and posters and for emphasis within a block of text. The Clarendon design was immediately very popular and was rapidly copied by other foundries to become in effect an entire genre of type design. Clarendon fonts proved extremely popular in many parts of the world, in particular for display applications such as posters printed with wood type. They are therefore commonly associated with wanted posters and the American Old West. A revival of interest took place in the post-war period: Jonathan Hoefler comments that \\"some of the best and most significant Clarendons are twentieth century designs\\" and highlights the Haas and Stempel foundry's bold, wide Clarendon display face as \\"a classic that for many people is the epitome of the Clarendon style.\\" Background Antique by Vincent Figgins, one of the first slab-serifs. Clarendon in a Fann Street Foundry specimen book of c. 1874, showing its use for emphasis within body text. Slab serif lettering and typefaces originated in Britain in the early nineteenth century, at a time of rapid development of new, bolder typefaces for posters and commercial printing. Probably the first slab-serif to appear in print was created by the foundry of Vincent Figgins, and given the name ‚Äúantique‚Äù. Others rapidly appeared, using names such as ‚ÄúIonic‚Äù and ‚ÄúEgyptian‚Äù, which had already also used as a name for sans-serifs. (At the time typeface names were often adjectives, often with little purpose to their name, although they may have been in this case reference to the ‚Äúblocky‚Äù, geometric structure of ancient architecture. There was limited separation between the name of typefaces and genres; if a font proved popular it would often be pirated and reissued by other foundries under the same name.) Compared to Figgins' \\"antique\\", the Clarendon design uses somewhat less emphatic serifs, which are bracketed rather than solid blocks, that widen as they reach the main stroke of the letter. Besley's design was not the first font with this style by at least three years, as typefaces labelled \\"Ionic\\" had already appeared in this style (other typefaces would copy this name), but the Clarendon design was particularly popular and its name rapidly copied. Historian James Mosley suggests that an inspiration for these designs may have been the style of handlettered capitals used by copper-plate engravers.

Both fonts show classic nineteenth-century design features, for instance on the ‚ÄòQ‚Äô, ‚ÄòR‚Äô, ‚Äòr‚Äô, ‚Äòa‚Äô and ‚Äòc‚Äô. However, the Clarendon is much wider with a higher x-height, and contrast between thick and thin strokes has been reduced. Besley's original Clarendon design was quite compressed, unlike most later 'Clarendons' intended for display setting, which are often quite wide. One of the original target markets for Besley's Clarendon design was to act as a bold face within body text, providing a stronger emphasis than the italic type that had been used for centuries for this purpose, and in this it matches the quite condensed body text faces of the period. (The modern system of issuing typefaces in families with a companion bold of matched design did not develop until the twentieth century.) Slab serifs had already begun to be used for bold type by the 1840s, but they were often quite lumpy in design and quite poorly matched to the body text face they were intended to complement. Mosley has written that \\"the Clarendon type of the Besley foundry is indeed the first type actually designed as a ‚Äòrelated bold‚Äô ‚Äì that is, made to harmonize in design and align with the roman types [regular weight typefaces] it was set with...Before the launch of Clarendon type printers picked out words in slab- serifs or any other heavy type.\\" However, because of the Clarendon design's strong reputation for quality, it was rapidly copied. Historian Nicolete Gray considered the earlier \\"Ionic\\" face from the Caslon Foundry in the same style more effective than Besley's: \\"[Besley's] became the normal, but it was certainly not the first‚Ä¶in 1842 Caslon have an upper and in 1843 a lower case with the characteristics fully developed, but of a normal width‚Ä¶Besley's [more compressed] Clarendon is much less pleasing, it has lost emphasis and confidence, and gains only in plausibility.\\" Clarendon-style type on the body text of an 1890 poster. Besley registered the typeface in 1845 under Britain's Ornamental Designs Act of 1842. The patent expired three years later, and other foundries quickly copied it. Besley was nonetheless successful in business, and became the Lord Mayor of London in 1869. Theodore De Vinne, a printer who wrote several influential textbooks on typography in the late nineteenth century, wrote that its name was a reference to the Clarendon Press in Oxford (now part of Oxford University Press), who he claimed immediately used it for dictionaries, although later authors have expressed doubt about this. With its growing popularity for display use, new versions often changed these proportions. By around 1874, the Fann Street Foundry (now Reed and Fox) could offer in its specimen book Clarendon designs that were condensed, \\"thin- faced\\" (light weight), extended, \\"distended\\" (extra-wide) and shaded. Revivals continued in the twentieth century, particularly in the 1950s. Monotype Modern with three fonts inspired by this style of design. At the bottom, Haas Clarendon shows reduced contrast and a wide, display-oriented structure. The text faces Century Schoolbook and especially Linotype Excelsior, a variant on Linotype Ionic, have text-oriented structures with narrower letterforms and smaller serifs than the Clarendon, but they show reduced contrast and more open letterforms to increase legibility compared to the Modern, particularly visible on Excelsior's ‚Äòe‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô and ‚Äòa‚Äô. The label \\"Ionic\\", originally also used for display faces, has become associated with typefaces with some Clarendon/slab-serif features but intended for body text, following the success of several faces with this name from first Miller & Richard (intended to be slightly bolder than contemporary expectations for body text proportions) and then Linotype (its 1922 release Ionic No. 5, extremely successful in newspaper printing). Millington notes that \\"Ionic became a distinct design in its own right\\" while Hoefler comments that it is now \\"chiefly associated with bracketed faces of the Century model\\". A decline of interest in Clarendons for display use did, however, take place in the early twentieth century: by 1923, American Type Founders, which specialised in creating demand for new designs of display face, could argue \\"Who remembers the Clarendons[?]\\" in its specimen book, and did not show them (aside from some numerals) in its 1,148 pages. In addition, the market of slab serifs was disrupted by the arrival of new \\"geometric\\" slab-serifs inspired by the sans- serifs of the period, such as Beton and Memphis. However, a revival of interest did appear after the war both in America and Europe. Revivals A variety of Clarendon revivals have been made since the original design, often adapting the design to different widths and weights. The original Clarendon design, a quite condensed design, did not feature an italic, and many early Clarendon designs, such as wood type headline faces, have capitals only with no lower-case letters, leaving many options for individual adaptation. The original Clarendon became the property of Stephenson Blake in 1906, who marketed a release named Consort, cutting some additional weights (a bold and italics) in the 1950s. The original materials were transferred to the Type Museum collection when Stephenson Blake left the printing business in 1996. Designs for wood type copying Clarendon were made from the mid-1840s onwards. Most hot metal typesetting companies offered some kind of slab serif; Linotype offered it duplexed to a Roman type so that it could be easily switched in for emphasis. The typeface was reworked by Monotype, with a redesigned release as \\"New Clarendon\\" in 1960. Hermann Eidenbenz cut a version in the early 1950s issued by Haas and Stempel, and later Linotype.http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Clarendon&q;=Go Freeman Craw drew the Craw Clarendon family, a once popular American version, released by American Type Founders, in 1955, with light, bold and condensed variants. The italic of Egizio, intended to complement the pre-existing Clarendon design concept. Aldo Novarese drew the Egizio family for Nebiolo, in Turin, Italy. The design included matching italics. David Berlow, of the Font Bureau, developed a revival as Belizio in 1998. The Clarendon Text family with italics inspired by Egizio, was released by Patrick Griffin of Canada Type. Volta, sold as Fortune in the U.S., was a very modern view of Clarendon, designed by Konrad Friedrich Bauer and Walter Baum for the Bauer Type Foundry in 1955. Ray Larabie, of Typodermic, released the Superclarendon family in 2007, using obliques instead of italics. A wide, display-oriented design with small caps and Greek and Cyrillic support, it is bundled with OS X. Sentinel, from Hoefler & Frere-Jones, another typeface family based on Clarendon with italics added, was designed in 2009. Intended to have less eccentric italics suitable for body text use, it has been featured heavily in President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign website advertisements. French Clarendon French Clarendon type (top) French Clarendon wood type at the Hamilton Wood Type Museum, Wisconsin. A document printed in 1836, showing early 'Italian' type on the word 'proceedings'. Later versions were more toned-down. French Clarendon type on a 1914 poster from Ljubljana. In the late nineteenth century the basic Clarendon face was radically altered by foundries in the United States, resulting in the production of the 'French Clarendon' type style, which had enlarged block serifs at top and bottom. This style is also traditionally associated with wild-west printing; it is commonly seen on circus posters and wanted notices in western movies.Provan, Archie, and Alexander S. Lawson, 100 Type Histories (volume 1), National Composition Association, Arlington, Virginia, 1983, pp. 20-21. However, it was actually used in many parts of the world at the time. The concept, now called as reverse-contrast or reverse- stress type, predated Clarendon altogether. It began, possibly around 1821 in Britain, as a parody of the elegant Didone types of the period. It was created by inverting the contrast of these designs, making the thin strokes thick and the thick strokes thin. The result was a slab serif design because of the serifs becoming thick. (In the 19th century, these designs were called Italian because of their exotic appearance, but this name is problematic since the designs have no clear connection with Italy; they do slightly resemble capitalis rustica Roman writing, but this may be a coincidence. For similar reasons they were also called Egyptian or Reversed Egyptian, Egyptian being an equally arbitrary name for slab serifs of the period.)De Vinne, Theodore Low, The Practice of Typography, Plain Printing Types, The Century Co., N.Y.C., 1902, p. 333. Intended as attention-grabbing novelty display designs rather than as serious choices for body text, within four years of their introduction the printer Thomas Curson Hansard had described them as 'typographic monstrosities'. Derivatives of this style persisted, and the concept of very thick serifs ultimately merged with the Clarendon genre of type. The advantage of French-Clarendon type was that it allowed very large, eye-catching serifs while the letters remained narrow, suiting the desire of poster-makers for condensed but very bold type. Fine printers were less impressed by it: DeVinne commented in 1902 that \\"To be hated, it needs but to be seen.\\" Because of their quirky, unusual design, lighter and hand-drawn versions of the style were popular for uses such as film posters in the 1950s and 60s. A variety of adaptations have been made of the style, Robert Harling's Playbill and more recently Adrian Frutiger's Westside, URW++'s Zirkus and Bitstream's P. T. Barnum. A radically different approach has been that of Trilby by David Jonathan Ross, who has written on the history of the genre. Released by Font Bureau, it is a modernisation reminiscent of Clarendon revivals from the 1950s. It attempts to adapt the style to use in a much wider range of settings, going so far as to be usable for body text. Terminology The following terms have been used for Clarendons and related slab serifs. Common meanings have been added, but they have often not been consistently applied. Many modern writers as a result ignore them and prefer the term slab-serif, providing individual descriptions of the features of specific designs. * Clarendon - often particularly used to refer to slab-serifs with 'bracketed‚Äô serifs. * Antique - the first name used for slab-serifs, but in France often used for sans-serifs. Sometimes taken to mean slab-serifs in the nineteenth- century style with Didone letterforms and thick, square slab-serifs. * Egyptian/Egyptienne - mostly used for slab-serifs generally, although first used by the Caslon Foundry in naming their sans-serif, the first made. Continued to be used as a name for \\"geometric\\" slab-serifs appearing in the twentieth century, and so several geometric slab-serifs had Egyptian-themed names, including Memphis, Cairo and Karnak. * Ionic - in the nineteenth century used as a name for slab-serifs. In the twentieth century this term became used to mean text faces with some Clarendon-style features, because of an influential body text face of this name from Linotype - this followed from previous faces of the same name only slightly bolder than text proportions from Miller & Richard. Appearances Craw Clarendon Bold on a U.S. National Park Service signCraw Clarendon Bold was used by the United States National Park Service on traffic signs, but has been replaced by NPS Rawlinson Roadway. Great Western Railway locomotive Bradley Manor A heavy bold Clarendon was used for the cast brass locomotive nameplates of the Great Western Railway. This was however drawn within the Swindon drawing office, not by a type foundry, and this 'Swindon Egyptian' differed in some aspects, most obviously the numerals used for the cabside numberplates. Versions of Clarendon can also be seen in the logotypes of corporations such as Sony, Pitchfork Media, Three Twins, Wells Fargo, the Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s, the 1961 Marvel Comics official logo, some Bandung pharmaceutical company such as Sanbe (either in company logo or on prescription medicine package), Ranbaxy's official logo, and the Swedish house manufacturer √Ñlvsbyhus. A custom variation of the typeface is used to display dollar amounts and other lettering on Wheel of Fortune's wheel.

Despite his abundant wealth, Strozzi lived well beyond his means and had little interest in his family‚Äôs banking business, which would help lead to his eventual economic and political downfall in the later half of the 15th century. In his sixties, together with Rinaldo degli Albizzi, he became the leader of the opposition against Cosimo de' Medici, the man who practically controlled the political power in Florence. Initially successful, the two secured the imprisonment of Cosimo, forcing him into exile in 1433. However, when Cosimo returned, both the Strozzi and Albizzi families were exiled in turn. In 1434, Strozzi moved to Padua, where he started to plan a return to his native city. He was never able to return, though his son did and built a large palace in 1480. He died in 1462, leaving his collection to the Abbey of Santa Giustina. As patron of the arts, he was commissioner of Gentile da Fabriano's Adoration of the Magi in the Strozzi Chapel of Santa Trinita church in Florence. He additionally commissioned Fra Angelico's Deposition of Christ in the Sacristy of Santa Trinita in Florence. His descendants settled in Ferrara.

He was a member of the Senate of Canada from 1867 to 1896. He was knighted for his service to the country in 1884. Life and career He was born in Castle Leathers in Inverness parish, Scotland, in 1818 and came to Lower Canada with his family in 1835. He became a clerk in the Montreal office of his older brother's shipping business, which transported passengers and freight in Upper and Lower Canada. In 1842, he became a senior partner in the business. In partnership with Alexander Tilloch Galt and Luther Hamilton Holton, Macpherson acquired the shares of the Montreal and Kingston Railway, knowing that their rail line was required as part of a planned railway connection between Montreal and Hamilton. He was part of a contracting firm formed to extend the Grand Trunk Railway in Upper Canada. In 1853, he moved to Toronto. He helped set up the Toronto Rolling Mills Company, which supplied track to the Grand Trunk. He also served as a director of the Bank of Upper Canada. In 1864, he was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada for Saugeen division and, in 1867, he was appointed to the Senate as a Conservative and served until his death. Macpherson was a member of the arbitration board that dealt with the financial issues associated with the creation of the separate provinces of Ontario and Quebec after Confederation. He led the resistance in the Senate to John Rose's proposed changes to banking legislation, and some of Macpherson's proposals made their way into the Bank Act of 1871. He served as Speaker of the Senate from 1880 to 1883. In the early eighties, the legalization of marriage with a deceased wife's sister was under discussion in the Parliament of Canada. On the day that the bill received its second reading in the Red Chamber, Macpherson invited Mrs. Susan Anna Wiggins, whose 'The Gunhilda Letters: Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister' letters of support for the bill had gained attention, to take a seat on his right, an honour which was never before accorded to any woman but the wife of a Governor-General. To commemorate his time as Speaker, Macpherson, as well as other Speakers of the Senate, had his name crafted in stained glass in the ceiling of the front foyer of the Senate Chamber. Macpherson also served in cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio from 1880 to 1883 and as Minister of the Interior from 1883 to 1885. In later life, Macpherson suffered from diabetes and he spent part of the summer and fall each year recovering at spas in Germany. He attempted to encourage settlement in western Canada along the planned route for the Canadian Pacific Railway, but settlers found land in the western United States more attractive. Problems with land policy, unwillingness to take action and a basic lack of understanding in Macpherson's ministry of the concerns of the M√©tis people helped set the stage for the North-West Rebellion in 1885. He resigned from his cabinet post later that year. He died at sea on August 16, 1896, on board the steamship Labrador, in mid-ocean, and his remains were buried at sea. Family Lady Macpherson by William Notman David Lewis Macpherson married on June 18, 1844, Elizabeth Sarah Molson, daughter of William Molson, President of Molson Bank, and his wife, Elizabeth Badgley, and granddaughter of the Hon. John Molson, member of the Executive and Legislative Councils of Lower Canada, and President of the Bank of Montreal. Elizabeth was born and educated in Montreal. The couple lived for forty years at their mansion, Chestnut Park, Toronto, Ontario. Lady Macpherson volunteered with the Toronto Ladies' Educational Association. Lady Macpherson died, after a long illness, at San Remo, Italy, March 23, 1894, aged 74. Her remains were cremated, and the ashes were deposited in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. The Honourable William Miller, K.C., pronounced in the Senate a tribute to Sir David and Lady Macpherson after the former's death. The couple had two sons and five daughters. Elizabeth Frances Dobell was the wife of the Hon. R. R. Dobell, M.P., P.C., Quebec. Naomi Beckett was the wife of Thomas Beckett. Helen Bankes was the wife of Major Meyrick Bankes, Highland Light Infantry, London. Christina Ridout was the wife of P. F. Ridout, Esquire, Toronto.

McCurdy (January 1, 1880 ‚Äì October 7, 1911) was an American bank and train robber who was killed in a shoot-out with police after robbing a Katy Train in Oklahoma in October 1911. Dubbed \\"The Bandit Who Wouldn't Give Up\\", his mummified body was first put on display at an Oklahoma funeral home and then became a fixture on the traveling carnival and sideshow circuit during the 1920s through the 1960s. After changing ownership several times, McCurdy's remains eventually wound up at The Pike amusement zone in Long Beach, California where they were discovered by a film crew and positively identified in December 1976. In April 1977, Elmer McCurdy's body was buried at the Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. Background McCurdy was born in Washington, Maine, on January 1, 1880. He was the son of 17-year-old Sadie McCurdy who was unmarried at the time of his birth. The identity of McCurdy's father is unknown; one possibility is Sadie's cousin, Charles Smith (McCurdy would later use the name \\"Charles Smith\\" as an alias). In order to save Sadie the embarrassment and shame of raising an illegitimate child, her brother George and his wife Helen adopted Elmer. After George died of tuberculosis in 1890, Sadie and Helen moved with Elmer to Bangor, Maine. Sadie eventually told her son that she, not Helen, was his mother and that she was unsure of who his biological father was. The news disturbed McCurdy who grew resentful and became \\"unruly and rebellious\\". As a teenager, he began drinking heavily, a habit he would continue throughout his life. McCurdy eventually returned to Maine to live with his grandfather and became an apprentice plumber. He reportedly was a competent worker and lived comfortably until the economic downturn in 1898. McCurdy lost his job and, in August 1900, his mother died of a ruptured ulcer. His grandfather died of Bright's disease the following month. Shortly after his grandfather's death, McCurdy left Maine and began drifting around the eastern United States where he worked as a lead miner and plumber. He was unable to hold a job for an extended period due to his alcoholism. He eventually made his way to Kansas where he worked as a plumber in Cherryvale. McCurdy then moved to Iola where, in 1905, he was arrested for public intoxication. He then relocated to Webb City, Missouri. In 1907, McCurdy joined the United States Army. Assigned to Fort Leavenworth, McCurdy was a machine gun operator and was trained to use nitroglycerin for demolition purposes (the extent of this training was likely minimal). He was honorably discharged from the Quartermaster Corps on November 7, 1910. McCurdy then made his way to St. Joseph, Kansas where he met with an Army friend. On November 19, McCurdy and his friend were arrested for possessing burglary paraphernalia (chisels, hacksaws, funnels for nitroglycerin and gunpowder and money sacks). The St. Joseph Gazette reported that during their arraignment, McCurdy and his friend told the judge the tools were not intended for burglary purposes but were tools they needed to work on a foot-operated machine gun they were inventing. In January 1911, a jury found McCurdy not guilty. After his release from county jail, McCurdy's short lived career as a bank and train robber began. His robberies were generally bungled affairs due to McCurdy's ineptitude. Crimes McCurdy decided to incorporate his training with nitroglycerin into his robberies. This often caused problems as he was overzealous and failed to correctly determine the proper amount to use. By March 1911, McCurdy had again relocated to Lenapah, Oklahoma. He and three other men decided to rob the Iron Mountain-Missouri Pacific train after McCurdy heard that one of the cars contained a safe with $4,000. They successfully stopped the train and located the safe. McCurdy then put nitroglycerin on the safe's door to open it but used too much. The safe was destroyed in the blast as was the majority of the money. McCurdy and his partners managed to net $450 in silver coins, most of which were melted and fused to the safe's frame. In September 1911, McCurdy and two other men robbed The Citizens Bank in Chautauqua, Kansas. After spending two hours breaking through the bank wall with a hammer, McCurdy placed a nitroglycerin charge around the door of the bank's outer vault. The blast blew the vault door through the bank destroying the interior, but did not damage the safe inside the vault. McCurdy then tried to blow the safe door open with nitroglycerin but the charge failed to ignite. After the lookout man got scared and ran off, McCurdy and his accomplices stole about $150 in coins that were in a tray outside the safe and fled. Later that night, the men hopped a train which took them to the Kansas border. They split up and McCurdy made his way to the ranch of a friend, Charlie Revard, near Bartlesville, Oklahoma. He stayed in a hayshed on the property for the next few weeks and drank heavily. Death McCurdy's final robbery took place on October 4, 1911 near Okesa, Oklahoma. McCurdy and two accomplices planned to rob a Katy Train after hearing that it contained $400,000 in cash that was intended as royalty payment to the Osage Nation. However, McCurdy and the men mistakenly stopped a passenger train instead. The men were able to steal only $46 from the mail clerk, two demijohns of whiskey, an automatic revolver, a coat and the train conductor's watch. A newspaper account of the robbery later called it \\"one of the smallest in the history of train robbery.\\" McCurdy was disappointed by the haul and returned to Revard's ranch on October 6 where he began drinking the demijohns of whiskey he stole. By this time, he was also ill with tuberculosis (which he developed after working in mines), a mild case of pneumonia and trichinosis. He stayed up drinking with some of the ranch hands before going to sleep in the hay loft the following morning. Unbeknownst to McCurdy, he had been implicated in the robbery and a $2,000 reward for his capture was issued. In the early morning hours of October 7, a posse of three sheriffs, brothers Bob and Stringer Fenton and Dick Wallace, tracked McCurdy to the hay shed using bloodhounds. They surrounded the hay shed and waited for daylight. In an interview featured in the October 8, 1911 edition of the Daily Examiner, Sheriff Bob Fenton recalled: > It began just about 7 o'clock. We were standing around waiting for him to > come out when the first shot was fired at me. It missed me and he then > turned his attention to my brother, Stringer Fenton. He shot three times at > Stringer and when my brother got under cover he turned his attention to Dick > Wallace. He kept shooting at all of us for about an hour. We fired back > every time we could. We do not know who killed him ... (on the trail) we > found one of the jugs of whiskey which was taken from the train. It was > about empty. He was pretty drunk when he rode up to the ranch last night. McCurdy was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest which he sustained while lying down. Post mortem commercialization McCurdy's body on display McCurdy's body was subsequently taken to the undertaker in Pawhuska, Oklahoma where it went unclaimed. Joseph L. Johnson, the owner and undertaker, embalmed the body with an arsenic-based preservative which was typically used in embalming in that era to preserve a body for a long period when no next of kin were known. He then shaved the face, dressed the body in a suit and stored it in the back of the funeral home. As McCurdy lay unclaimed, Johnson refused to bury or release the body until he was paid for his services. Johnson then decided to exhibit McCurdy to make money. He dressed the corpse in street clothes, placed a rifle in the hands and stood it up in the corner of the funeral home. For a nickel, Johnson allowed visitors to see \\"The Bandit Who Wouldn't Give Up\\" (at various times, McCurdy was also called \\"The Mystery Man of Many Aliases\\", \\"The Oklahoma Outlaw\\", and \\"The Embalmed Bandit\\"). \\"The Bandit\\" became a popular attraction at the funeral home and drew the attention of carnival promoters. Johnson received numerous offers to sell McCurdy's corpse but refused. On October 6, 1916, a man calling himself ‚ÄúAver‚Äù contacted Joseph Johnson claiming to be Elmer McCurdy's long lost brother from California. Aver had already contacted the Osage County, Oklahoma sheriff and a local attorney to get permission to take custody of the body and ship it to San Francisco for proper burial. The following day, Aver arrived at the Johnson Funeral Home with another man calling himself Wayne, who also claimed to be McCurdy's brother. Johnson released the body to the men who then put it on a train, ostensibly to San Francisco. It was instead shipped to Arkansas City, Kansas. The men who claimed to be McCurdy's long lost brothers were in fact James and Charles Patterson. James Patterson was the owner of the Great Patterson Carnival Shows, a traveling carnival. After learning from his brother Charles about the popular \\"Embalmed Bandit\\" exhibit, the two concocted a scheme to take possession of the body in order to feature it in Patterson's carnival. McCurdy's corpse would be featured in Patterson's traveling carnival as \\"The Outlaw Who Would Never Be Captured Alive\\", until 1922 when Patterson sold his operation to Louis Sonney. Louis Sonney used McCurdy's corpse in his traveling \\"Museum of Crime\\" show which featured wax replicas of famous outlaws such as Bill Doolin and Jesse James. In 1928, the corpse was part of the official sideshow that accompanied the Trans-American Footrace. In 1933, it was acquired for a time by director Dwain Esper to promote his exploitation film Narcotic!. The corpse was placed in the lobby of theaters as a \\"dead dope fiend\\" whom Esper claimed had killed himself while surrounded by police after he had robbed a drug store to support his habit. By the time Esper acquired McCurdy's body, it had become mummified; the skin had become hard and shriveled causing the body to shrink. Esper claimed that the skin's deterioration was proof of the supposed dope fiend's drug abuse. Waymap of Elmer McCurdy's Odyssey After Louis Sonney died in 1949, the corpse was placed in storage in a Los Angeles warehouse. In 1964, Sonney's son Dan lent the corpse to filmmaker David F. Friedman. It eventually made a brief appearance in Friedman's 1967 film She Freak. In 1968, Dan Sonney sold the body along with other wax figures for $10,000 to Spoony Singh, the owner of the Hollywood Wax Museum. Singh had bought the figures for two Canadian men who exhibited them at a show at Mount Rushmore. While being exhibited there, the corpse sustained some damage in a windstorm; the tips of the ears, along with fingers and toes, were blown off. The men eventually returned the corpse back to Singh who decided that it looked \\"too gruesome\\" and not lifelike enough to exhibit. Singh then sold it to Ed Liersch, part owner of The Pike, an amusement zone in Long Beach, California. By 1976, McCurdy's corpse was hanging in the \\"Laff In the Dark\\" funhouse exhibition at The Pike. Rediscovery and burial On December 8, 1976, the production crew of the television show The Six Million Dollar Man were filming scenes for the \\"Carnival of Spies\\" episode at The Pike. During the shoot, a prop man moved what was thought to be a wax mannequin that was hanging from a gallows. When the mannequin's arm broke off, a human bone and muscle tissue were visible. Police were called and the mummified corpse was taken to the Los Angeles coroner's office. On December 9, Dr. Joseph Choi conducted an autopsy and determined that the body was that of a human male who had died of a gunshot wound to the chest. The body was completely petrified, covered in wax and had been covered with layers of phosphorus paint. It weighed approximately 50 pounds (23 kg) and was 63 inches (160 cm) in height. Some hair was still visible on the sides and back of the head while the ears, big toes and fingers were missing. The examination also revealed incisions from his original autopsy and embalming. Tests conducted on the tissue showed the presence of arsenic which was a component of embalming fluid until the late 1920s. Tests also revealed tuberculosis in the lungs which McCurdy had developed while working as a miner, bunions and scars that McCurdy was documented to have had. While the bullet that caused the fatal wound was presumably removed during the original autopsy, the bullet jacket was found. It was determined to be a gas check, which were first used in 1905 until 1940. These clues helped investigators pinpoint the era in which the man had been killed. Further clues to the man's identity were found when the mandible was removed for dental analysis. Inside the mouth was a 1924 penny and ticket stubs to the 140 W. Pike, Side Show and Louis Sonney's Museum of Crime. Investigators contacted Dan Sonney who confirmed that the body was Elmer McCurdy. Forensic anthropologist Dr. Clyde Snow was then called in to help make a positive identification. Dr. Snow took radiographs of the skull and placed them over a photo of McCurdy taken at the time of his death in a process called superimposition. Snow was able to determine that skull was that of Elmer McCurdy. By December 11, the story of McCurdy's journey had been featured in newspapers and on television and radio. Several funeral homes called the coroner's office offering to bury McCurdy free of charge, but officials decided to wait to see if any living relatives would come forward to claim the body. Fred Olds, who represented the Indian Territory Posse of Oklahoma Westerns, eventually convinced Dr. Thomas Noguchi, then the Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles, to allow him to bury the body in Oklahoma. After further testing to ensure proper identification, Olds was allowed to take custody of the body. On April 22, 1977, a funeral procession was conducted to transport McCurdy to the Boot Hill section of the Summit View Cemetery in Guthrie, Oklahoma. A graveside service attended by approximately 300 people was conducted after which McCurdy was buried next to another outlaw, Bill Doolin. To ensure that McCurdy's body would not be stolen, two feet (60 cm) of concrete were poured over the casket.

Ten kilometers from the town is Cidade Ecl√©tica, a nucleus of people who make up a universal fraternity, a spiritualist community founded by Oceano de S√°, known as Mestre Yokaanam. The traditional festival of Santo Ant√¥nio do Descoberto is in homage to the patron saint and takes place on 13 June. It attracts thousands of pilgrims and followers of the saint and there are stands, processions and music. History The history of European occupation of the region of Santo Ant√¥nio goes back to 1726 when, according to tradition, slaves belonging a Portuguese gold seeker sat down to rest and supposedly discovered an image of Santo Ant√¥nio in the branches of a tree. They took it to their master and a chapel was built in 1728. Soon the site became a place of pilgrimage attracting people from near and far.

These bacteria, usually found in decomposing plants and milk products, produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end product of carbohydrate fermentation. This trait has, throughout history, linked LAB with food fermentations, as acidification inhibits the growth of spoilage agents. Proteinaceous bacteriocins are produced by several LAB strains and provide an additional hurdle for spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, lactic acid and other metabolic products contribute to the organoleptic and textural profile of a food item. The industrial importance of the LAB is further evidenced by their generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status, due to their ubiquitous appearance in food and their contribution to the healthy microbiota of animal and human mucosal surfaces. The genera that comprise the LAB are at its core Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus, as well as the more peripheral Aerococcus, Carnobacterium, Enterococcus, Oenococcus, Sporolactobacillus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus, and Weissella; these belong to the order Lactobacillales. Characteristics The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are either rod-shaped (bacilli), or spherical (cocci), and are characterized by an increased tolerance to acidity (low pH range). This aspect helps LAB to outcompete other bacteria in a natural fermentation, as they can withstand the increased acidity from organic acid production (e.g., lactic acid). Laboratory media used for LAB typically include a carbohydrate source, as most species are incapable of respiration. LAB are catalase-negative. LAB are amongst the most important groups of microorganisms used in the food industry. Their relative simple metabolism has also prompted their use as microbial cell factories for the production of several commodities for the food and non-food sectors Metabolism Two main hexose fermentation pathways are used to classify LAB genera. Under conditions of excess glucose and limited oxygen, homolactic LAB catabolize one mole of glucose in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway to yield two moles of pyruvate. Intracellular redox balance is maintained through the oxidation of NADH, concomitant with pyruvate reduction to lactic acid. This process yields two moles of ATP per mole of glucose consumed. Representative homolactic LAB genera include Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, and group I lactobacilli Heterofermentative LAB use the pentose phosphate pathway, alternatively referred to as the pentose phosphoketolase pathway. One mole of glucose-6-phosphate is initially dehydrogenated to 6-phosphogluconate and subsequently decarboxylated to yield one mole of CO2. The resulting pentose-5-phosphate is cleaved into one mole glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) and one mole acetyl phosphate. GAP is further metabolized to lactate as in homofermentation, with the acetyl phosphate reduced to ethanol via acetyl-CoA and acetaldehyde intermediates. In theory, end products (including ATP) are produced in equimolar quantities from the catabolism of one mole of glucose. Obligate heterofermentative LAB include Leuconostoc, Oenococcus, Weissella, and group III lactobacilli Streptococcus reclassification Streptococcus In 1985, members of the diverse genus Streptococcus were reclassified into Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Vagococcus, and Streptococcus based on biochemical characteristics, as well as molecular features. Formerly, streptococci were segregated primarily based on serology, which has proven to correlate well with the current taxonomic definitions. Lactococci (formerly Lancefield group N streptococci) are used extensively as fermentation starters in dairy production, with humans estimated to consume 1018 lactococci annually. Partly due to their industrial relevance, both L. lactis subspecies (L. l. lactis and L. l. cremoris) are widely used as generic LAB models for research. L. lactis ssp. cremoris, used in the production of hard cheeses, is represented by the laboratory strains LM0230 and MG1363. In similar manner, L. lactis ssp. lactis is employed in soft cheese fermentations, with the workhorse strain IL1403 ubiquitous in LAB research laboratories. In 2001, Bolotin et al. sequenced the genome of IL1403, which coincided with a significant shift of resources to understanding LAB genomics and related applications. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in NomenclatureSee the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature. Data extracted from See the NCBI webpage on Lactobacillales Data extracted from and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA-based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.See 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project . Data extracted from the =Lactobacillales part 2 (continued)= Notes: ‚ô† Strains found at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, but not listed in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature Bacteriophages A broad number of food products, commodity chemicals, and biotechnology products are manufactured industrially by large-scale bacterial fermentation of various organic substrates. Because enormous amounts of bacteria are being cultivated each day in large fermentation vats, the risk that bacteriophage contamination rapidly brings fermentations to a halt and cause economical setbacks is a serious threat in these industries. The relationship between bacteriophages and their bacterial hosts is very important in the context of the food fermentation industry. Sources of phage contamination, measures to control their propagation and dissemination, and biotechnological defence strategies developed to restrain phages are of interest. The dairy fermentation industry has openly acknowledged the problem of phage contamination, and has been working with academia and starter culture companies to develop defence strategies and systems to curtail the propagation and evolution of phages for decades. =Bacteriophage‚Äìhost interaction= The first contact between an infecting phage and its bacterial host is the attachment of the phage to the host cell. This attachment is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP), which recognizes and binds to a receptor on the bacterial surface. RBPs are also referred to as host- specificity protein, host determinant, and antireceptor. For simplicity, the RBP term will be used here. A variety of molecules have been suggested to act as host receptors for bacteriophages infecting LAB; among those are polysaccharides and (lipo)teichoic acids, as well as a single-membrane protein. A number of RBPs of LAB phages have been identified by the generation of hybrid phages with altered host ranges. These studies, however, also found additional phage proteins to be important for successful phage infection. Analysis of the crystal structure of several RBPs indicates that these proteins share a common tertiary folding, and support previous indications of the saccharide nature of the host receptor. Gram-positive LAB have a thick peptidoglycan layer, which must be traversed to inject the phage genome into the bacterial cytoplasm. Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are expected to facilitate this penetration, and such enzymes have been found as structural elements of a number of LAB phages. Probiotics Probiotics are products aimed at delivering living, potentially beneficial, bacterial cells to the gut ecosystem of humans and other animals, whereas prebiotics are indigestible carbohydrates delivered in food to the large bowel to provide fermentable substrates for selected bacteria. Most strains used as probiotics belong to the genus Lactobacillus. (Other probiotic strains used belong to the genus Bifidobacterium). Probiotics have been evaluated in research studies in animals and humans with respect to antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, travellers' diarrhoea, pediatric diarrhoea, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. In the future, probiotics possibly will be used for different gastrointestinal diseases, vaginosis, or as delivery systems for vaccines, immunoglobulins, and other therapies. Exopolysaccharides The quest to find food ingredients with valuable bioactive properties has encouraged interest in exopolysaccharides from LAB. Functional food products that offer health and sensory benefits beyond their nutritional composition are becoming progressively more important to the food industry. The sensory benefits of exopolysaccharides are well established, and there is evidence for the health properties that are attributable to exopolysaccharides from LAB. However, there is a wide variation in molecular structures of exopolysaccharides and the complexity of the mechanisms by which physical changes in foods and bioactive effects are elicited. Lactic acid bacteria and dental plaque LAB are able to synthesize levans from sucrose, and dextrans from glucose. Glucans, such as dextran, enable bacteria to adhere to the surface of teeth, which in turn can cause tooth decay through the formation of dental plaque and production of lactic acid. While the primary bacteria responsible for tooth decay is Streptococcus mutans, LAB are among the most common oral bacteria which cause dental cavities. Lactic acid bacteria and fermentation of beverages thumb Lactic acid bacteria are used in the food industry for a variety of reasons such as the production of cheese and yogurt products. This process has been going on for thousands of years by human ancestors. But, some of the beverages we enjoy today are produced by using lactic acid bacteria. Popular drinks such as kombucha have known to have traces of lactobacillus and pediococcus once the drink is made. Even the beer and wine-making process utilizes certain lactic acid bacteria mostly lactobacillus. The interesting relationship between lactic acid bacteria and yeast can be observed in the wine-making process. The LAB is used to start the wine-making process by starting the malolactic fermentation. After the malolactic fermentation, yeast cells are used to start the alcoholic fermentation process in grapes. The malolactic fermentation mechanism is mainly transformation of L-malic acid (dicarboxylic acid) to an lactic acid (monocarboxylic acid). This change occurs due to the presence of malolactic and malic enzymes. All malic acid are degraded and this increase the pH levels which changes the taste of the wine. Not only do they start the process but they are responsible for the different aromas produced in wine by the nutrients presence and the quality of the grapes. Also, the presence of different strains can change the desirability of aromas' presence. The different availability of enzymes that contribute to the vast spectrum of aromas in wine are associated with glycosidases, Œ≤-glucosidases, esterases, phenolic acid decarboxylases and citrate lyases. By using molecular biology, researchers can help pick out different desirable strains that help improve the quality of wine and help with the removable of the undesirable strains. The same can be said about brewing beer as well which uses yeast with some breweries using lactic acid bacteria to change the taste of their beer.

The science of pattern formation deals with the visible, (statistically) orderly outcomes of self-organization and the common principles behind similar patterns in nature.

The role of genes in pattern formation is an aspect of morphogenesis, the creation of diverse anatomies from similar genes, now being explored in the science of evolutionary developmental biology or evo-devo.

In developmental biology, pattern formation describes the mechanism by which initially equivalent cells in a developing tissue in an embryo assume complex forms and functions.Ball, 2009. Shapes, pp. 261‚Äì290. Embryogenesis, such as of the fruit fly Drosophila, involves coordinated control of cell fates. Pattern formation is genetically controlled, and often involves each cell in a field sensing and responding to its position along a morphogen gradient, followed by short distance cell-to-cell communication through cell signaling pathways to refine the initial pattern. In this context, a field of cells is the group of cells whose fates are affected by responding to the same set positional information cues. This conceptual model was first described as the French flag model in the 1960s. More generally, the morphology of organisms is patterned by the mechanisms of evolutionary developmental biology, such as changing the timing and positioning of specific developmental events in the embryo. Possible mechanisms of pattern formation in biological systems include the classical reaction‚Äìdiffusion model proposed by Alan TuringS. Kondo, T. Miura, \\"Reaction- Diffusion Model as a Framework for Understanding Biological Pattern Formation\\", Science 24 Sep 2010: Vol. 329, Issue 5999, pp. 1616-1620 DOI: 10.1126/science.1179047 and the more recently found elastic instability mechanism which is thought to be responsible for the fold patterns on the cerebral cortex of higher animals, among other things.Tallinen et al. Nature Physics 12, 588‚Äì593 (2016) doi:10.1038/nphys3632 Growth of colonies Bacterial colonies show a large variety of patterns formed during colony growth. The resulting shapes depend on the growth conditions. In particular, stresses (hardness of the culture medium, lack of nutrients, etc.) enhance the complexity of the resulting patterns.Ball, 2009. Branches, pp. 52‚Äì59. Other organisms such as slime moulds display remarkable patterns caused by the dynamics of chemical signaling.Ball, 2009. Shapes, pp. 149‚Äì151. Vegetation patterns Tiger bush is a vegetation pattern that forms in arid conditions. Vegetation patterns such as tiger bush and fir waves form for different reasons. Tiger bush consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes in countries such as Niger where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. In flat terrains additional pattern morphologies appear besides stripes - hexagonal gap patterns and hexagonal spot patterns. Pattern formation in this case is driven by positive feedback loops between local vegetation growth and water transport towards the growth location. =Chemistry= Pattern formation has been well studied in chemistry and chemical engineering, including both temperature and concentration patterns. The Brusselator model developed by Ilya Prigogine and collaborators is one such example that exhibits Turing instability. Pattern formation in chemical systems often involve oscillatory chemical kinetics or autocatalytic reactions such as Belousov‚ÄìZhabotinsky reaction or Briggs‚ÄìRauscher reaction. In industrial applications such as chemical reactors, pattern formation can lead to temperature hot spots which can reduce the yield or create hazardous safety problems such as a thermal runaway. The emergence of pattern formation can be studied by mathematical modeling and simulation of the underlying reaction-diffusion system. * Belousov‚ÄìZhabotinsky reaction * Liesegang rings =Physics= In the 1980s Lugiato and Lefever developed a model of light propagation in an optical cavity that results in pattern formation by the exploitation of nonlinear effects. B√©nard cells, laser, cloud formations in stripes or rolls. Ripples in icicles. Washboard patterns on dirtroads. Dendrites in solidification, liquid crystals. Solitons. =Mathematics= Sphere packings and coverings. Mathematics underlies the other pattern formation mechanisms listed. =Computer graphics= Pattern resembling a reaction‚Äìdiffusion model, produced using sharpen and blur Some types of automata have been used to generate organic-looking textures for more realistic shading of 3d objects.Greg Turk, Reaction‚ÄìDiffusion A popular Photoshop plugin, KPT 6, included a filter called 'KPT reaction'. Reaction produced reaction‚Äìdiffusion style patterns based on the supplied seed image. A similar effect to the 'KPT reaction' can be achieved with convolution functions in digital image processing, with a little patience, by repeatedly sharpening and blurring an image in a graphics editor. If other filters are used, such as emboss or edge detection, different types of effects can be achieved. Computers are often used to simulate the biological, physical or chemical processes that lead to pattern formation, and they can display the results in a realistic way. Calculations using models like reaction‚Äìdiffusion or MClone are based on the actual mathematical equations designed by the scientists to model the studied phenomena.

The position was historically Mayor of Nottingham; this was changed to Lord Mayor in 1928. The position is elected every May by Nottingham city councillors at their annual council meeting. History The post of Mayor of Nottingham was created in the Charter of Edward I approved on 12 February 1284. The title was changed to Lord Mayor of Nottingham by Letters Patent, announced by King George V on 10 July 1928, at the opening of the new University College at Highfields. The first holder of the title was the Mayor for the current year, Alderman Edmund Huntsman. Contrary to popular belief, the Mayoral status was unaffected when Nottingham achieved city status during the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in June 1897. The bestowing of City status is normally a separate issue to the rank of the Mayor concerned. In fact, there is only one case of a Borough being given City status and its Mayor being elevated to Lord Mayor at the same time ‚Äì this occurred with Cardiff in 1905. It has recently (i.e. since 2002) become the established rule that newly created cities should wait for an interval of at least 10 years before making an application for a Lord Mayoralty. After City status had been awarded, Nottingham applied (unsuccessfully) for a Lord Mayor in 1911 (marking the Coronation of King George V), and to mark Royal visits in both 1914 and 1919. Historically, the Mayor of Nottingham was elected in a ceremony in St. Mary's Church, Nottingham. Although the election no longer happens in the church, a civic service is held there each year to mark the Lord Mayor's appointment. Role Some of the duties of the Lord Mayor include being a champion of the city and attending official events. The role also includes supporting up to 3 charities and presenting the Lord Mayor's Awards for Urban Design.

His libretti were put to music by composers like Claudio Monteverdi, Francesco Cavalli, Francesco Manelli, and Francesco Sacrati. He sometimes used the pseudonym Luigi Zorzisto. Biography Giulio Strozzi was a bastard, and later legitimized, son of Roberto Strozzi, from the Strozzi family. Born in Venice in 1583, he first studied there before going to the University of Pisa to study law. He lived and worked in Rome, Padua and Urbino before returning to Venice in the 1620s. He was the adoptive father of composer Barbara Strozzi (born in 1619 from Isabella Garzoni, a woman servant living in Strozzi's house, and possibly his illegitimate daughter). He remained there until his death on 31 March 1652. Work He wrote poetry and plays, but is best remembered as one of the first writers of libretti, the texts used for all kinds of musical plays but most specifically opera. His earliest known work was in 1609, an oration for the burial of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, for whom he also organized the burial rites. It was the first in a long-term series of efforts to get the patronage of the Medici family during the next decades, including a lengthy dedication of his 1624 reprint of the Venetia edificata to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1621, he wrote his only epic poem, Venetia edificata. It was expanded and reprinted in 1624. Celebrating the glory of the Republic of Venice, it was at the same time written in support of Galileo Galilei and his controversial scientific theories. He also wrote a translation of the Spanish Lazarillo de Tormes which remained unpublished. From 1627 on, he mostly dedicated himself to writing opera libretti, and he was probably the most important opera writer in Venice in the 1630s and 1640s. He wrote La finta pazza Licori for Claudio Monteverdi in 1627. The two had first met in 1621. The opera was never performed and it is unknown how much of the music for it had been written before the project was abandoned. Both the music and the libretto are lost. In the 1630s and 1640s, Strozzi was one of the driving forces behind the successful growth of opera in Venice. He wrote the libretto for the opening of the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in 1639 (La Delia, music by Francesco Manelli), and for the 1641 opening of the Teatro Novissimo (La finta pazza, music by Francesco Sacrati). In 1630 Strozzi wrote Proserpina Rapita. His last libretto, Veremonda, was written for Francesco Cavalli in 1652. He was a member of the Accademia degli Incogniti in Venice. He was the founder of some cultural \\"academies\\", gatherings of like-minded intellectuals; these included the Ordinati during his stay in Rome, and the Dubbiosi in Venice. In 1637 he founded the Accademia degli Unisoni, a gathering of musicians where his adopted daughter Barbara sang.

Its path is below the posterior belly of digastric to the occipital region. This artery supplies blood to the back of the scalp and sternocleidomastoid muscles, and deep muscles in the back and neck. Structure At its origin, it is covered by the posterior belly of the digastricus and the stylohyoideus, and the hypoglossal nerve winds around it from behind forward; higher up, it crosses the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the vagus and accessory nerves. It next ascends to the interval between the transverse process of the atlas and the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and passes horizontally backward, grooving the surface of the latter bone, being covered by the sternocleidomastoideus, splenius capitis, longissimus capitis, and digastricus, and resting upon the rectus capitis lateralis, the obliquus superior, and semispinalis capitis. It then changes its course and runs vertically upward, pierces the fascia connecting the cranial attachment of the trapezius with the sternocleidomastoideus, and ascends in a tortuous course in the superficial fascia of the scalp, where it divides into numerous branches, which reach as high as the vertex of the skull and anastomose with the posterior auricular and superficial temporal arteries. Function # Muscular branches: supply the digastric, stylohyoid, splenius, and longus capitis muscles. # Sternocleidomastoid branch: This branch divides into upper and lower branches in the carotid triangle. The upper branch accompanies the accessory nerve to the sternocleidomastoid, and the lower branch arises near the origin of the occipital artery before entering the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Occasionally, this branch arises directly from the external carotid artery. # Auricular branch: supplies the back of the ear. In many specimens, this branch gives rise to the mastoid branch, which supplies the dura mater, diploe, and mastoid air cells. In other specimens, the mastoid artery is a branch of the occipital artery, rather than the auricular branch. # Meningeal branch: supplies the dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa # Descending branches: This is the largest branch. It descends on the posterior aspect of the neck, and divides into a superficial and deep portion. The superficial portion supplies the trapezius muscle and anastomoses with the ascending branch of the transverse cervical. The deep portion anastomoses with the vertebral artery and with the a. profunda cervicalis, a branch of the costocervical trunk. Thus, branches of the occipital artery participate in anastamosis between the external carotid and the subclavian artery, thereby providing collateral circulation. Its terminal portion is accompanied by the greater occipital nerve. Additional images Image:Gray513.pngThe internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Right side.

The radar beam is rotated in a small circle around the \\"boresight\\" axis, which is pointed at the target. Conical scanning is a system used in early radar units to improve their accuracy, as well as making it easier to steer the antenna properly to point at a target. Conical scanning is similar in concept to the earlier lobe switching concept used on some of the earliest radars, and many examples of lobe switching sets were modified in the field to conical scanning during World War II, notably the German W√ºrzburg radar. Antenna guidance can be made entirely automatic, as in the American SCR-584. Potential failure modes and susceptibility to deception jamming led to the replacement of conical scan systems with monopulse radar sets. They are still used by the Deep Space Network for maintaining communications links to space probes. The spin-stabilized Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes used onboard conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit. Concept A typical radar antenna commonly has a beam width of a few degrees. While this is adequate for locating the target in an early warning role, it is not nearly accurate enough for gun laying, which demands accuracies on the order of 0.1 degrees. It is possible to improve the beam width through the use of larger antennas, but this is often impractical. In order to monitor the direction of a designated target, it is only necessary to keep the antenna pointed directly at the target. Knowledge of the pointing direction of the antenna then gives knowledge of the target direction. In order to have the radar system follow a moving target automatically, it is necessary to have a control system that keeps the antenna beam pointing at the target as it moves. The radar receiver will get maximum returned signal strength when the target is in the beam center. If the beam is pointed directly at the target, when the target moves it will move out of the beam center and the received signal strength will drop. Circuitry designed to monitor any decrease in received signal strength can be used to control a servo motor that steers the antenna to follow the target motion. There are three difficulties with this method: # The radar will have no information as to which direction the target has moved, and therefore no indication as to which direction to move the antenna to follow it. # As the target moves away from the beam centre, the received power changes only very slowly at first. Thus the system is rather insensitive to antenna pointing errors. # Variations in target echo power caused by scintillation are interpreted as target motion. Conical scanning Variation of the echo signal in a conical scanning Conical scanning addresses this problem by moving the radar beam slightly off center from the antenna's midline, or boresight, and then rotating it. Given an example antenna that generates a beam of 2 degrees width - fairly typical - a conical scanning radar might move the beam 1.5 degrees to one side of the centerline by offsetting the feed slightly. The resulting pattern, at any one instant in time, covers the midline of the antenna for about 0.5 degrees, and 1.5 degrees to the side. By spinning the feed horn with a motor, the pattern becomes a cone centered on the midline, extending 3 degrees across. The key concept is that a target located at the midline point will generate a constant return no matter where the lobe is currently pointed, whereas if it is to one side it will generate a strong return when the lobe is pointed in that general direction and a weak one when pointing away. Additionally, the portion covering the centerline is near the edge of the radar lobe, where sensitivity is falling off rapidly. An aircraft centered in the beam is in the area where even small motions will result in a noticeable change in return, growing much stronger along the direction the radar needs to move. The antenna control system is arranged to move the antenna in azimuth and elevation such that a constant return is obtained from the aircraft being tracked. Whilst use of the main lobe alone might allow an operator to \\"hunt\\" for the strongest return and thus aim the antenna within a degree or so in that \\"maximum return\\" area at the center of the lobe, with conical scanning much smaller movements can be detected, and accuracies under 0.1 degree are possible. Construction There are two ways to cause the redirection of the beam from the antenna's midline. The first is referred to as a rotated feed. As its name suggests, a feed horn is set just off the parabolic focal point which causes the energy to focus slightly off the antenna midline. The feed is then rotated around the focal point of the paraboloid to produce the conical rotation. The other system is a nutated feed. A nutated feed offsets the antenna at an angle to a fixed feed horn, and then rotates the antenna. A variation of a nutated feed makes the feed move in a small circle, rapidly and continuously changing the pointing direction of the beam. In this latter type, neither the feed nor the antenna revolves around the pointing axis of the antenna; only the pointing direction changes, tracing out a narrow cone. The primary difference between the two basic schemes is in polarization. As the feed horn in the rotated process spins, the polarization changes with the rotation and will thus be 90 degrees off in polarization when the feed is 90 degrees off its initial axis. As the feed horn is fixed in nutated feeds, no polarization changes occur. Most early systems used a rotated feed, due to its mechanical simplicity, but later systems often used nutated feeds in order to use the polarization information. In the U.S. Navy Mk. 25 gun fire control radar, spiral scan mode aided target acquisition. Basically conical scan (of the non-revolving nutating feed type), the size of the scan cone cyclically increased and decreased roughly twice a second. The scanned area was several degrees, in all. (Once the target was acquired, the operator switched to conical scan for tracking.) Since the lobe is being rotated around the midline of the antenna, conical scanning is only really appropriate for antennas with a circular cross section. This was the case for the W√ºrzburg, which operated in the microwave region. Most other forces used much longer-wavelength radars that would require paraboloid antennas of truly enormous size, and instead used a \\"bedspring\\" arrangement of many small dipole antennas arranged in front of a passive reflector. To arrange conical scanning on such a system would require all of the dipoles to be moved, an impractical solution. For this reason the US Army simply abandoned their early gun laying radar, the SCR-268. This was not particularly annoying, given that they were in the process of introducing their own microwave radar in the aftermath of the Tizard Mission. In the SCR-584, the MIT Radiation Laboratory introduced automatic tracking. Automatic guidance for the antenna, and thus any slaved guns or weapons, can be added to a conical scan radar without too much trouble. The control system has to steer the antenna such that a constant amplitude return is received from the target. Unfortunately there are a number of factors that can dramatically change the reflected signal. For instance, changes in the target aircraft's direction can present different portions of the fuselage to the antenna, and dramatically change the amount of signal being returned. In these cases, a conical scan radar might interpret this change in strength as a change in position. For instance, if the aircraft were to suddenly \\"brighten\\" when it was off-axis to the left, the circuitry might interpret this as being off to the right if the change occurs when the lobe is aligned in that direction. This problem can be solved by using two simultaneous overlapping receiver beams leading to the monopulse radar, so-named because it always compares signal strength from a single pulse against itself, thereby eliminating problems with all but impossibly fast changes in signal strength. =Conical-scan receive-only (COSRO)= COSRO systems do not modify the transmit signal sent from the antenna. Antenna waveguide in COSRO systems includes an RF received feedhorn structure that produces a left/right RF receive sample and an up/down RF receive sample. These two signals are multiplexed inside a waveguide device that has a rotating vane. The output of the multiplex device is a single RF signal and two position signals that indicate left/right and up/down. The COSRO technique does not transmit any signals that indicate the position of the rotating vane. =Antenna sampling= RF receive signals from multiple transmit pulses are combined mathematically to create a vertical and horizontal signal. The vertical signal is created by adding RF samples when the vane/feedhorn is in the up direction and subtracting RF samples when the vane/feedhorn is in the down direction. The horizontal signal is created by adding RF samples when the vane/feedhorn is in the left direction and subtracting RF samples when the vane/feedhorn is in the right direction. This produces a pair of angle error signals used to drive antenna positioning drive motors. Jamming Conical scan radars can be easily jammed. If the target knows the general operating parameters of the radar, it is possible to send out a false signal timed to grow and fade in the same pattern as the radar lobe, but inverted in strength. That is, the false signal is at its strongest when the radar signal is the weakest (the lobe is on the \\"far side\\" of the antenna compared to the aircraft), and weakest when the signal is the strongest (pointed at the aircraft). When added together with the \\"real\\" signal at the radar receiver, the resulting signal is \\"always strong\\", so the control system cannot make an accurate estimate as to where in the lobe pattern the target is located. Actually accomplishing this in hardware is not as difficult as it may sound. If one knows that the signal is rotated at 25 RPM, as it was in the W√ºrzburg radar, the jammer is built to fade from maximum to zero at the same speed, 25 times a minute. Then all that is needed is to sync the signals up, which is accomplished by looking for the low point in the signal (which is generally easier to find) and triggering the pattern at that point. This system, known as inverse gain jamming, was used operationally by the Royal Air Force against the W√ºrzburg radar during World War II. It is possible to arrange a radar so the lobes are not being moved in the broadcaster, only the receiver. To do this, one adds a second antenna with the rotating lobe for reception only, a system known as COSRO, for Conical Scan on Receive Only (compare to LORO, a similar system used against lobe switching radars). Although this denied lobing frequency information to the jammer in the aircraft, it was still possible to simply send out random spikes and thereby confuse the tracking system (or operator). This technique, called SSW for Swept Square Wave, doesn't protect the aircraft with the same sort of effectiveness as inverse gain, but is better than nothing and often fairly effective.

Lancelot becomes a portrait artist and takes a studio in Chelsea. The Dean disapproves and thinks Lancelot should become a curate, which leads to distance between them. Lancelot gets engaged to poet Gladys Bingley. His uncle accepts the post of Bishop of Bongo-Bongo in West Africa and sends a letter to Lancelot telling him to look after his cat Webster. Lancelot hopes that if he treats the cat well then he may be able to get enough money from his rich uncle to marry Gladys. The Dean believes that Webster is an upstanding cat and he will inspire Lancelot to become less bohemian and more respectable. Webster, a large black cat, is very austere, and Lancelot feels pressured by Webster's judgmental gaze to act and dress according to proper etiquette. Two of Lancelot's friends become concerned and try to tell him not to give in to the cat, but it is no use. Webster does not appear to approve of Gladys, so Lancelot gets engaged to Brenda Carberry-Pirbright, who seems prim and unpleasant, to please Webster. Lancelot's friends wire Gladys Bingley, who is away in France, to come reason with Lancelot. She confronts him about his engagement to Brenda. He tells he does not want to marry Brenda but feels he must do what Webster wishes. She tells him to come see her only if he chooses her over Brenda, and leaves. Lancelot, nervous in front of Webster, drops a bottle of whisky onto the floor, and is stunned to see Webster drink it. Webster becomes genial and breaks into a dance, then turns belligerent and attacks a footstool. After seeing this spectacle, Lancelot is no longer intimidated by Webster and goes to see Gladys and reunite with her. = \\"Cats will be Cats\\"= * US: American, March 1932 (as \\"The Bishop's Folly\\") * UK: Strand, June 1932 (as \\"The Bishop's Folly\\") ;Plot A Whisky and Splash at the Angler's Rest asks Mr Mulliner what happened to Webster, the cat from the previous story, which leads to Mr Mulliner telling the following tale. After his encounter with alcohol, Webster has completely changed into a bohemian, unsophisticated cat that freely brawls with other cats on the street. Lancelot, who is still supposed to be looking after Webster, learns that his uncle will be returning from Africa soon. Lancelot is nervous, since his uncle will notice that Webster bears obvious signs of having been in fights. However, Lancelot's uncle does not come to see Lancelot. He sends a letter saying that he is at Widdrington Manor in Hampshire, the home of the widowed Lady Widdrington and her mother, Mrs Pulteney-Banks. Lady Widdrington has a cat named Percy. Uncle Theodore disapproves of Percy, since he saw Percy getting into a fight with another cat, so does not want Webster to join him there and tells Lancelot to keep him for a little while longer. Lancelot and his fianc√©e Gladys now have time to reform Webster. They both want to please Lancelot's rich uncle so he will give them money to get married. They are only able to improve Webster's appearance slightly before Lancelot is summoned to Widdrington Manor by his uncle, who wants Lancelot to pretend to be his lawyer. At the house, the Bishop explains that he pretended Lancelot was his lawyer as part of a failed attempt to get away from the house. During his voyage back to England, he got carried away in the romantic shipboard atmosphere and courted Lady Widdrington, but now wants to avoid her. Lady Widdrington and her mother are determined and counter every excuse the Bishop has to leave the house. The Bishop wants Lancelot to stay by him and prevent him from getting engaged to Lady Widdrington. He will reward Lancelot with enough money to marry Gladys. The Bishop tries to sneak out at night, but is caught by Percy and pretends he was walking in his sleep. Mrs Pulteney-Banks can tell why the Bishop wants to leave, but Lady Widdrington believes he must merely be missing his cat Webster. Webster is brought to the Bishop, and he is alarmed at the cat's toughened appearance. However, after Percy appears and gets into a fight with Webster, the Bishop cheers Webster on. Percy loses and flees. Lady Widdrington is angered by Webster and wants the Bishop to leave. The Bishop happily embraces Webster and pays Lancelot. =\\"The Knightly Quest of Mervyn\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, April 1931 (as \\"Quest\\") * UK: Strand, July 1931 (as \\"Quest\\") The magazine version of the story, \\"Quest\\", features Freddie Widgeon and does not include Mr Mulliner. ;Plot Someone sings a song about chivalry and knights in the room across the passage from the bar-parlour of the Angler's Rest. Mr Mulliner states that the chivalrous spirit of knights still flourishes in the Mulliners, which can be seen in the story of his cousin's son Mervyn. Mervyn Mulliner wants to marry Clarice Mallaby. She thinks he is a chump and does not consent to marry him. Mervyn wants to prove himself and asks her to give him a quest, like the knights of old. It is December, and she has always wanted to eat strawberries in the middle of winter, so she tells Mervyn that she will reconsider his proposal of marriage if he acquires a basket of strawberries for her before the end of the month. Mervyn has a wealthy acquaintance, Oofy Prosser, who gives lavish parties with expensive food and would know how to get strawberries in December. Oofy tells Mervyn that strawberries can be bought at Bellamy's in Piccadilly, for around a pound apiece. Mervyn only has one pound, two shillings and threepence in his pocket. Mervyn's maternal uncle Joseph, Lord Blotsam, has an account at Bellamy's, so Mervyn goes there and tries to buy a basket of strawberries on his uncle's account. The woman in the shop telephones his uncle, who says he does not want to buy any strawberries. Mervyn pretends his uncle was joking and tries to take the strawberries anyway. He is quickly arrested. Mervyn is sentenced to a ten pound fine or fourteen days in jail. He sends a message to his uncle who sends ten pounds for the fine and orders him to Blotsam Regis in Shropshire, where he will not be able to get into trouble and embarrass his uncle further. At the house, Mervyn sees strawberries in a hothouse, which are for Lord Blotsam's upcoming Christmas party. Mervyn quickly puts some of the strawberries in a box and returns to London. He reaches London, but accidentally leaves the box of strawberries in the train. Next, he tries to borrow money from Oofy Prosser to buy strawberries for Clarice. Oofy refuses to give him any money but is interested to hear about Clarice's quest. Mervyn goes to Clarice's house in Eaton Square, hoping she will give him credit for having tried his best. A boy delivers a parcel and gives it to Mervyn, mistakenly thinking he is the butler. The package has strawberries for Clarice from Oofy, who tried to win Clarice's favour. Mervyn is annoyed with Oofy but gets an idea and calls out to Clarice that he brought her strawberries. However, by the time she reaches the room, he has absent-mindedly eaten all the strawberries. Clarice throws him out. He failed his quest, but Mr Mulliner commends his effort. =\\"The Voice from the Past\\"= * US: American, November 1931 * UK: Strand, December 1931 ;Plot A change of headmasters in the public school near the Angler's Rest leads to Mr Mulliner telling a tale about his mild and timid nephew Sacheverell Mulliner, whose shyness Mr Mulliner attributes to the intimidating headmaster Sacheverell had to deal with as a boy. Sacheverell Mulliner, a diffident young man, is secretly engaged to the hearty Muriel Branksome, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Redvers Branksome. Muriel Branksome was once engaged to her cousin Bernard, but broke it off because he was too bossy. Muriel invites Sacheverell to her house, Branksome Towers, but he does not get along well with her father, who talks about farming and hunting whereas Sacheverell is interested in literature and ballet. Muriel suggests that Sacheverell take a correspondence course in Scientific Agriculture so he can easily converse with Sir Redvers. Back in London, Sacheverell pays for and starts his correspondence course. After several lessons, he realizes he has been taught nothing about agriculture. He goes to the headquarters of the Leave-It-To-Us Correspondence School to complain. He makes his strongly-worded complaint to the manager, Jno B. Philbrick, who explains that the wrong course was sent to Sacheverell, and it has apparently worked, since Sacheverell actually received a course on acquiring self-confidence. Sacheverell continues taking the self-confidence course and becomes even more assertive. Sacheverell sees Muriel in a cab with her cousin Bernard, and becomes jealous. Later, he tells Muriel not to see Bernard again. Muriel is not pleased with Sacheverell's new domineering attitude. Back at Branksome Towers, Sacheverell is upset to see that Bernard is also there. The Bishop of Bognor will also be visiting. Muriel tells Sacheverell that he will not be in the Blue Suite, which is the best guest room, and Sacheverell assumes that she has given it to Bernard. At dinner, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Redvers initially refuses to eat spinach, but does so when Sacheverell tells him to. Muriel informs Sacheverell she will not marry him, since he has become bossy. Sacheverell thinks she has left him for Bernard, so he hides in the Blue Room to confront Bernard. However, it is actually the Bishop who comes to the room. The Bishop was Sacheverell's headmaster, the Rev. J. G. Smethurst. Sacheverell is affected by his old headmaster's voice and loses all his assertiveness. He tries to escape but accidentally goes into the suite's bathroom. The Bishop hears him and alerts Sir Redvers. They think there is a burglar and arm themselves with weapons. Sacheverell climbs out through a window and reaches Muriel's room. She sees he is afraid and helps him hide. Sacheverell is diffident again, so Muriel loves him and will marry him. He stops taking the correspondence course, and is too shy to ask for a refund. =\\"Open House\\"= * UK: Strand, April 1932 * US: American, April 1932 ;Plot Mr Mulliner tells his listeners about his nephew Eustace Mulliner. Eustace is a successful employee of the British Embassy in Switzerland, though at one time he was reluctant to take the job, as Mr Mulliner explains. Eustace's godfather, Lord Knubble of Knopp, uses his influence to get Eustace a job offer at the British Embassy in Switzerland, but Eustace wants to stay in London. He is the favourite nephew of his wealthy and elderly Aunt Georgiana, Lady Beazley-Beazley, and wants to continue earning her affection to stay in her will. Eustace also wants to court Marcella Tyrrwhit. She is leaving for Paris and asks Eustace to look after her two pets, Reginald the Pekingese dog and William the canary. A week or so earlier, Eustace was in love with someone else, Beatrice Watterson, and plans to end his courtship with her gradually and tactfully while Marcella is away. Eustace invites Beatrice to his flat for lunch for her birthday and remarks that he must get her a nice present. Eustace plans to be away visiting his Aunt Georgiana on that day, so Beatrice will be offended when he is absent. It is sunny, so Eustace puts William's cage on the window-sill to enjoy the sunlight. William is singing on the window-sill when a man Orlando Wotherspoon comes to Eustace's flat. Wotherspoon is the vice president of Our Dumb Chums' League, an animal welfare organization, and thinks Eustace is cruel for putting a canary out in the sun. The dog Reginald is startled by Wotherspoon's large moustache, but Wotherspoon misunderstands and claims that Reginald is scared of Eustace. Wotherspoon leaves him with a warning but will check on Eustace's treatment of the animals again. Later, Eustace prepares to visit his aunt. He tells his valet Blenkinsop to explain his absence to Beatrice and give her anything she wants. Eustace later returns to find that Blenkinsop took this literally and gave Beatrice the dog. Eustace plans to tell Marcella that Blenkinsop lost the dog. Aunt Georgiana visits Eustace and brings her cat, Francis. William is capable of dodging Francis, but Eustace tries to stop the cat nonetheless by throwing food at it. His aunt, Marcella, and Wotherspoon all see this and are displeased. Marcella saw Beatrice with her dog in Paris and came to confront Eustace. While the three of them discuss how to deal with Eustace, he flees. Mr Mulliner gives him tickets to Switzerland. He is now doing well at the Embassy. =\\"Best Seller\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, June 1930 (without Mr Mulliner) * UK: Strand, July 1930 See \\"Best Seller\\". =\\"Strychnine in the Soup\\"= * US: American, December 1931 (as \\"The Missing Mystery\\") * UK: Strand, March 1932 See \\"Strychnine in the Soup\\". =\\"Gala Night\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, May 1930 * UK: Strand, June 1930 ;Plot Mr Mulliner tells another story about his nephew Augustine Mulliner, now a vicar. (Augustine previously appeared in \\"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\\" and \\"The Bishop's Move\\"). The tale involves Ronald Bracy-Gascoigne, a young man of independent means living in Augustine's village, and Hypatia Wace, a friend of Augustine's wife Jane and niece of Augustine's superior, the Bishop of Stortford. Ronald and Hypatia are engaged, and need the Bishop's consent to marry. Hypatia's Uncle Percy and Aunt Priscilla, the Bishop and his wife, disapprove of Ronald because he was expelled from Oxford and dances at night clubs. They see the Rev. Augustine Mulliner, who is cheerful and energetic because he takes a tonic called Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo, and Ronald suggests that they give some of the tonic to the Bishop so he will be more accepting of him. Ronald thinks he has no chance of marrying Hypatia, and they make plans to have a goodbye dance at a night club which is having a Gala Night, fancy dress optional. Augustine is more optimistic and tells Hypatia he will help her marry Ronald. Augustine tries to convince Hypatia's aunt and uncle to accept Ronald, but is unsuccessful. Later, the Bishop is strangely cheerful and borrows a Sindbad the Sailor costume from Augustine. Augustine remembers seeing the Bishop acting similarly once before when he took some Buck-U-Uppo (during the events of \\"The Bishop's Move\\"). Ronald and Hypatia do not go to the Gala Night since Ronald hears there will be a police raid. Hypatia tells Augustine she gave the Bishop and his wife some Buck-U-Uppo. Augustine realizes she gave them too much. Hypatia says her aunt borrowed a Columbine costume from her. Hypatia and Augustine realize the two went to the Gala Night. The Bishop and his wife dance at the party and come back, chased by a policeman named Cyril Smith. After Augustine gives Cyril a drink with Buck-U-Uppo, Cyril becomes friendly. The Bishop and his wife cheerfully consent to Hypatia marrying Ronald. Hypatia, her aunt and uncle, and Cyril all go to wake up Ronald and tell him the good news. Augustine has to stay behind to write a sermon but is very happy for them.

Abu Muhammad Ziyadat Allah I succeeded his brother Abdallah I (812‚Äì817) to the Emirate of Ifriqiya. During his rule the relationship between the ruling dynasty on the one hand and the jurists and Arab troops on the other remained strained. When Ziyadat Allah I attempted to disband the Arab units in 824, it led to a great revolt at Tunis, which was only put down in 836 with the help of the Berbers. Ziyadat had already begun campaigns in Italy in an attempt to divert the restless Arab troops, and so in 827 there began the gradual conquest of Sicily from the Byzantine Empire, under the jurist Asad ibn al-Furat. Although initially repulsed by the Byzantines, they managed to conquer Palermo in 831. Power struggles on the Italian mainland afforded further opportunity for conquest and plunder - a call for aid from the Duke of Naples enabled them to establish a foothold in southern Italy and begin extensive raids against the Christians. The economic health of the kingdom, in spite of the political unrest, enabled a substantial building programme. The mosque of Uqba ibn Nafi in Kairuan was renovated and refurnished, and more city defenses were erected. Ziyadat Allah I wasn't the first of the Aghlabids to convert to mu'tazilism, but he appointed, with his mu'tazilite qadi of Qairawan Abu Muhriz al Kilabi (appointed by Ibrahim I in 806), Assad ibn al Furat, considered one of the most important sunni leaders of his time in Ifriqya. The majority of the Aghlabid rulers stayed loyal to mu'tazilism until their end in 909 (except during the rule of Muhammad I), even after it was rejected by the Abbassids in 848. After the death of Ziyadat Allah I his brother Abu Iqal (838‚Äì841) became Emir. Portrayal Ziyadat Allah I is portrayed by Kal Naga in the 5th season of the historical drama television series Vikings.

Graphics were composed mostly of solid geometry rendered without shading. History Developed in-house by Incentive Software, Freescape is considered to be one of the first proprietary 3D engines to be used in computer games, although the engine was not used commercially outside of Incentive's own titles. The project was originally thought to be so ambitious that according to Incentive designer Ian Andrew, the company struggled to recruit programmers for the project, with many believing that it could not be achieved. Paul Gregory (graphics artist for Major Developments, Incentive's in-house design team) mentions Retro Gamer 22, Incentive article, page 26 that Freescape was developed by Chris Andrew starting in September 1986 on an Amstrad CPC, as it was the most suitable development system with 128K memory and had adequate power to run 3D environments. Due to the engine's success, it was later ported to all the dominant systems of the era: the ZX Spectrum, the IBM PC, the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST. Freescape development ended in 1992 with the release of 3D Construction Kit II. Its legacy continued in the latter Superscape VRT virtual reality authoring engine, from the same developer and advertised on the 3D Construction Kit II software. Technology = Geometry = The Freescape engine allowed the generation of complete 3D environments that consist of a floor and as many primitives as memory and processor speed realistically allowed for. These primitives were cuboids, four-sided frustums (called pyramids by Freescape), triangles, rectangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons and line segments. A further primitive, \\"sensor\\", was used for gaming purpose to detect the position of the camera relative to the sensor in the game world. Freescape was designed with limited hardware in mind and as such contains a number of inherent limitations that are necessary to enable the games to run properly on these computers: *Individual regions were restricted to a size of 8192 √ó 4096 √ó 8192 units. These units were arbitrary but each region always corresponded to the dimensions. *The engine did not allow for fractional movements. On 16-bit machines each movement ‚Äî camera or object ‚Äî must be a multiple of one unit. On 8-bit machines the angles at which the world may be viewed are further restricted to steps of 5 degrees. *The x and z axes were subdivided into only 128 discrete locations, and the y axis is subdivided into only 64 discrete locations. As a result, objects can only be placed at 64 unit intervals, for example, 0,64,128 or 128,64,32. *Objects may not overlap. *All objects possessed a \\"bounding cube\\", for which detection rules apply as per a cube, i.e. no overlapping. = Interaction = Games used the Freescape Command Language ('FCL'), an early in-game scripting language, to add interactive elements to Freescape worlds. Scripts may be set to run constantly for the entire world or run constantly for a certain area, or may be attached to individual objects where they will be run once if the object is shot, activated or collided with. Versions of Freescape for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC also supported 'animators', which were FCL programs that use a few extra instructions to create on-screen animations.

The church oversees the second largest Catholic church membership in the United States. Its average Sunday attendance is 11,200.  History  = Background = Interior In 1869, Dallas's first Catholic parish, Sacred Heart Church, was established by the Bishop of Galveston. The church was built in 1872 and was located at Bryan and Ervay Streets, near present-day St. Paul Station. In 1890, Dallas was established as a diocese, and Sacred Heart became the diocesan cathedral of Dallas with Bishop Thomas Brennan acting as the first bishop. Along with Dallas' tremendous growth at the time, the parish soon outgrew its church building, and the need for a new cathedral arose. = Construction = The property on which the current Cathedral is now located was purchased for US$30,000, which adjusted for inflation, is equivalent to over $600,000 in 2007.: Using a CPI Inflation Calculator and inputing $30,000 for 1913 (the lowest available year) returns well over $600,000 in 2007 dollars. The cornerstone for the Cathedral was laid June 17, 1898 and the church was formally dedicated on October 26, 1902.Photograph of the cornerstone at Wikimedia Commons. = Consolidation = As the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex grew through the early 20th century, other diocesan parishes were built in neighboring suburbs, decreasing Sacred Heart's attendance. However, by the 1960s the neighboring Our Lady of Guadalupe parish had outgrown its facilities. Sign reflecting growing Spanish-speaking population The parish, located on Harwood Street, was established in 1914 and primarily served Mexican immigrants. Bishop Thomas Tschoepe of Sacred Heart invited Our Lady of Guadalupe to merge with Sacred Heart, and by 1975, the Guadalupe church on Harwood closed following the churches' consolidation. On December 12, 1977, Sacred Heart Cathedral was renamed Cathedral Santuario de Guadalupe‚Äî\\"the Cathedral Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\\" This reflects the large Spanish- speaking proportion of the congregation, so that the congregation now has masses and various programs in Spanish and English, as well as English classes. = Expansion = The Cathedral recently underwent a major multi- phase renovation project. As part of the project, a US$20 million bell tower housing a 49-bell carillon was constructed. The bell tower was planned by the original architect, Nicholas J.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany. Biography Born in Chemnitz, Saxony, Friessner enlisted in the German Army in 1911 and, after seeing extensive duty during World War I, served in the Reichswehr following the war.https://ww2gravestone.com/people/friessner-johannes-hans/ After his promotion to Generalmajor during World War II on 1 August 1940, Friessner was assigned to the Eastern Front on 1 May 1942 and placed in command of the 102nd Infantry Division. Shortly after his promotion to Generalleutnant on 1 October 1942, Friessner served as commander of the XXIII Corps from 19 January to 11 December 1943. On 1 April 1943, he was promoted General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry). In February 1944, Friessner was transferred to the Northern Front and assigned command to Sponheimer Group (renamed army detachment \\"Narva\\" on 23 February). Promoted to Generaloberst on 1 July, Friessner briefly held command of Army Group North until 25 July before being sent to the southern front to command Army Group South Ukraine (later redesignated Army Group South). Unable to halt the four month Soviet offensive by Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's Second Ukrainian Front, Friessner was relieved of his command on 22 December. Holding no further command for the remainder of the war, Friessner lived in retirement in Bayerisch Gmain until his death on 26 June 1971. In 1951, he was the chairman of the Verband deutscher Soldaten (Union of German Soldiers). During the early 1950s he was active in advising on the redevelopment of the West German army, the Bundeswehr. In 1956, Friessner wrote Verratene Schlachten (Betrayed Battles), a memoir of his tour of command of Army Group South Ukraine.

It belongs to the Danainae subfamily of the brush-footed butterfly family Nymphalidae. Danainae primarily consume plants in the genus Asclepias, more commonly called milkweed. Milkweed contains toxic compounds, cardenolides, which are often consumed and stored by many butterflies. Because of their emetic properties, the plain tiger is unpalatable to most predators. As a result, the species' coloration is widely mimicked by other species of butterflies. The plain tiger inhabits a wide variety of habitats, although it is less likely to thrive in jungle-like conditions and is most often found in drier, wide-open areas. D. chrysippus encompasses three main subspecies: D. c. alcippus, D. c. chrysippus, and D. c. orientis. These subspecies are found concentrated in specific regions within the larger range of the entire species. The plain tiger is believed to be one of the first butterflies depicted in art. A 3500-year-old ancient Egyptian fresco in Luxor features the oldest known illustration of this species.  Description  D. chrysippus is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of about . The body is black with many white spots. The wings are orange, the upperside brighter and richer than the underside. The apical half of the forewing is black with a white band. The hindwing has three black spots in the center. The wings are bordered in black and outlined with semicircular white spots. D. chrysippus is a polymorphic species, so the exact coloring and patterning vary within and between populations. It is similar in appearance to the Indian fritillary (Argynnis hyperbius), which may coexist with it. File:Plain tiger butterfly wing scales.jpgClose-up of the wing scales of Danaus chrysippus File:Danaus chrysippus male 2 by kadavoor.jpgMale showing the pheromone pouch and brush- like organ in Kerala  Geographic range  The plain tiger is found across the entirety of Africa, where the predominant subspecies is D. c. alcippus. Its range extends across the majority of Asia throughout Indian subcontinent, as well as many south Pacific islands. The plain tiger is even present in parts of Australia. D. c. chrysippus is most common throughout Asia and in some select regions in Africa, while D. c. orientis is present in more tropical African regions as well as some African islands, including Madagascar and the Seychelles. It is also found in Kuwait, throughout the regions.  Habitat  The plain tiger prefers arid, open areas, and is found in a variety of habitats, including deserts, mountains, deciduous forests, and human-tended gardens in cities and parks. It is comfortable at altitudes ranging from sea level to around .  Food resources  = Larval food plants = The plain tiger's larval host plants are from several families, most importantly Asclepiadoideae (Apocynaceae): * Asclepias ‚Äì milkweeds (recorded on A. cancellata, A. coarctata, A. curassavica, A. fulva, A. kaessneri, A. lineolata, A. physocarpa, A. reflexa, A. scabrifolia, A. semilunata, A. stenophylla, A. swynnertonii, A.syriaca) * Aspidoglossum interruptum * Calotropis ‚Äì mudar (recorded on C. gigantea, C. procera) * Caralluma burchardii (recorded from Canary Islands/Spain) * Ceropegia dichotoma (recorded from Canary Islands/Spain) * Cryptolepis buchananii * Cynanchum (recorded on C. abyssinicum, C. acutum, C. altiscandens, C. amplexicaule, C. carnosum, C. floribundum, C. sublanceolatum) * Gomphocarpus fruticosus * Kanahia laniflora * Leichardtia australis * Leptadenia hastata * Marsdenia leichhardtiana * Metaplexis japonica * Orbea variegata (recorded from Canary Islands/Spain) * Oxystelma pulchellum * Pentatropis (recorded on P. atropurpurea, P. quinquepartita) * Pergularia daemia * Periploca linearifolia * Pleurostelma cernuum * Secamone (recorded on S. afzelii, S. parvifolia, S. platystigma * Stapelia gigantea * Stathmostelma (recorded on S. gigantiflorum, S. pedunculatum) * Tylophora (recorded on T. stenoloba, T. sylvatica) Host plants from other families include Dyerophytum indicum (Plumbaginaceae), Ficus (Moraceae; recorded on F. laevis, F. racemosa), Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae; recorded on I. alba, I. bona-nox), Lepisanthes rubiginosa (Sapindaceae) as well as some Euphorbiaceae, Malvaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae and Scrophulariaceae. = Adult food plants = Adult plain tiger butterflies obtain nectar from various flowering plants. The particular plants available vary depending on the geographic range of the butterfly population and the season, as certain plants do not flower throughout the entire year.  India  * Catheranthus roseus * Lantana camara * Vernonia cinera * Tridax procumbens * Asystasia gangetica * Antigonon leptopus, January through April and August through December * Tecoma stans, May through December  Australia  * Goodenia maidenian * Eucalyptus conglobata * E. oleosa * Ptilotis obovata * Asclepias * Lantana * Leucopogon * Daviesia In addition to nectar, adult plain tigers obtain pyrrolizidine alkaloids from the dead stems of different plant types. In Australia, the following plants have been identified as sources of pyrrolizidine alkaloids for D. chrysippus: * Parsonsia eucalyptophylla * P. straminea * Echium plantogineum * Senecio pterophorus * Heliotropium amplexicaule  Parental care  = Oviposition = Females lay eggs singly on the underside of the leaves of a larval food plant. The eggs are most often laid close to the ground.  Life history  = Egg = The egg of the plain tiger is about long and across. When first laid it is white, but gradually turns brown over time. The egg is ridged and dome-shaped. Depending on temperature, the egg is typically hatched in 3‚Äì5 days. File:Plain tiger butterfly egg.jpgEgg at Tamil Nadu, India File:Plain tiger egg.JPGAt Mananpur, Mumbai, Maharashtra = Caterpillar = The larvae of D. chrysippus proceeds through five instar stages. The first instar is about long, and its body is white while the head is black. The second instar is about long, and its body is primarily gray with yellow and black horizontal stripes. This coloration remains for the final three instar stages. The third instar is about long, the fourth about long, and the fifth about long. Depending on temperature, the larval stage can last from 12‚Äì20 days.

Such potential predators include various kinds of spiders, assassin bugs, cockroaches, ladybugs, ants, and mantises. The caterpillars will even cannibalize each other. Egg and larval mortality is often high; as many as 84% of eggs may be lost to predation and up to 97% of larvae can be lost by the fifth instar, although most larval deaths occur during the third instar.  Adult predators  The most common predator of adult plain tigers are birds. In eastern Africa, the most common predator is the fiscal shrike L. c. humeralis. = Parasites = There are several organisms which parasitize the larvae of D. chrysippus. The fly S. flavohalterata of the Family Tachinidae is responsible for small amounts of parasitization in D. chrysippus populations. It is unclear whether the fly oviposits on the eggs of D. chrysippus or whether the fly oviposits on leaves which are then consumed by D. chrysippus larvae. S. flavohalterata does not kill the larvae, and development is normal until the pupal stage, when larvae dies and the parasite emerges from the pupa instead. A. chrysippi, a parasitic wasp of the family Braconidae, oviposits on larvae early in their development and then kills them in the later stages. As many as fifty wasps may emerge from one large caterpillar, and they then pupate on the deceased host. Parasitic wasps of the genus Charops also infest plain tiger populations, likely during the egg or first instar stage, and then kill the larvae in a later instar stage. Sturmia convergens is also a parasitoid of D. chrysippus. = Diseases = The plain tiger is infected by a male-killing bacterium called Spiroplasma. Male-killing bacteria are transmitted vertically, from mother to offspring. Female plain tigers infected with Spiroplasma will produce all-female broods, because the bacteria kills infected male offspring during either their embryonic or first larval instar stage. Although male-killing bacteria are uncommon in species which lay eggs singly, experimentally treating infected females with antibiotics restored an even sex ratio to their subsequent broods, thus indicating that it is indeed Spiroplasma which is responsible for all-female broods in D. chrysippus. However, the prevalence of this bacteria in the plain tiger seems to be restricted to east African populations.  Protective coloration and behavior  The plain tiger is mimicked by several species due to its unpalatability to potential predators. Previously, it was thought that cardenolides obtained from food sources during the larval stage were responsible for the aversive nature of adult D. chrysippus, but many larval food sources lack cardenolides, and some adult West African populations of D. chrysippus do not store cardenolides well, yet still repel predators. More recently, pyrrolizidine alkaloids have been proposed to be also responsible for the unpalatability of D. chrysippus. Adult male danaines often feed on plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and although females rarely do, they may be protected simply through their resemblance to males of the same species. The ability of D. chrysippus to store cardenolides varies across populations, so likely both cardenolides and pyrrolizidine alkaloids contribute to the unpalatability of D. chrysippus to different extents depending on the population. Because the plain tiger is unpalatable (also called inedible), they are aposematic - their bright coloration serves as a warning to predators that they are either distasteful or toxic. Consequently, once a predator has made the mistake of attempting to eat a plain tiger, they will refrain in the future from attacking similarly colored butterflies. This has led to the evolution of a number of other species which mimic the plain tiger in order to co-opt the protection conferred by such bright coloration. = Batesian mimicry = Batesian mimics are palatable species which mimic unpalatable species, and D. chrysippus is a model for several Batesian mimics, including H. misippus, P. poggei, M. marshalli, and P. dardanus in east Africa. Batesian mimicry is only effective so long as the mimic is less common than the model, or predators will learn that the mimics are in fact edible and then attempt to eat the similar-looking unpalatable butterflies. = M√ºllerian mimicry = M√ºllerian mimicry occurs when multiple species which are all unpalatable evolve to resemble one another. In this case, the relative abundance of each species does not have a deleterious effect on any others, because a predator which eats any one of them will be deterred from eating any similar-looking butterflies. In Uganda, D. chrysippus has several M√ºllerian mimics, including A. encedon and A. encedana.  Genetics  = Subspecies = Despite the external similarity, the common tiger (D. genutia) is not closely related to the plain tiger. Three subspecies were considered valid in a 2005 review:Smith et al. (2005) * Danaus chrysippus chrysippus : Asia, Mediterranean region, northern tropical Africa * Danaus chrysippus alcippus (Cramer, 1777) \\\\- formerly D. c. aegyptius : From the Cape Verde Islands through tropical Africa to Yemen and Oman. Browner with broader white forewing spots. * Danaus chrysippus orientis (Aurivillius, 1909) \\\\- formerly D. c. liboria : Saint Helena, southern tropical Africa to South Africa, Madagascar, Comoros, Seychelles and Mascarenes. Small white forewing spots. D. c. alcippus is well on the way of becoming a distinct species. On the other hand, the former subspecies petilia is nowadays recognized as a good species, the lesser wanderer (D. petilia). More enigmatic is the status of the former subspecies (or forms) dorippus and bataviana. These are tentatively also regarded as a distinct species, the dorippus tiger (D. dorippus). However, it appears (from analysis of mtDNA sequences, which are only inherited from the mother) that the dorippus tiger is the product of an ancient lineage of Danaus hybridizing with plain tiger females. As the plain tiger is known to be parasitized at least occasionally by Spiroplasma bacteria which selectively kill off male hosts,Jiggins et al. (2000) a subsequent scarcity of plain tiger males might have led to this hybridization and the evolution of the dorippus tiger. From the colour pattern of this species, it can be assumed that the ancient lineage had no black apex on the forewings, as this characteristic is still absent in D. dorippus. The presumed subspecies cratippus most likely belongs to either the lesser wanderer or the dorippus tiger, but confirmation of its taxonomic status requires more research. In any case, these three species are closely related; their closest relatives, in turn, might be the soldier (D. eresimus) and queen (D. gilippus) butterflies. Several local forms have been described from Asia: * Danaus chrysippus chrysippus f. alcippoides : The upper hindwing is more or less very white; about half of the individuals have a second submarginal spot in the forewing. Occasionally found in South-East Asia, very rarely in India. * Danaus chrysippus chrysippus f. gelderi : The upper hindwing has white markings. Occasionally found on Sulawesi. * Danaus chrysippus chrysippus f. bowringi : The upper hindwing has a subapical band composed of somewhat larger spots, and an additional forewing spot as in f. alcippoides is always present. Found throughout the eastern parts of this subspecies' range. On the other hand, the plethora of named taxa from Africa are apparently F1 or F2 hybrids between the plain tiger subspecies (the contact zone of which is in the general area of Uganda) and/or D. dorippus: * Danaus chrysippus √ó alcippoides : is D. c. chrysippus √ó D. c. alcippus * Danaus √ó transiens, Danaus √ó klugii, Danaus √ó albinus and Danaus √ó semialbinus : are D. c. alcippus √ó D. dorippus = Genomes = When D. chrysippus was analyzed via a sample from Kampala, Uganda, it was found that the population was undergoing a significant level of evolutionary change. Three loci were examined, and genotypic frequency differences found at two of the three suggested that opposing selective forces, likely pertaining to Mullerian and Batesian mimicry, acting on males and females is contributing to a balanced polymorphism.  Courtship and mating  D. c. chrysippus mating in Hyderabad, India In addition to conferring protection from predators, pyrrolizidine alkaloids are necessary in the mating ritual of D. chrysippus. Male plain tigers use the alkaloids to synthesize pheromones which are stored in hair- pencils sheathed in alar organs, which are specialized scales on top of the hindwing. The hair-pencils are fanned out during courtship to release these pheromones, and this appears to be necessary for attracting females. Males deprived of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in their diet are considerably less successful in mating; mating appears to occur preferentially between butterflies of the same subspecies, so coloration is likely also an important signal in the mating process. Female plain tigers have been recorded as mating up to four times.

Ali Murad then captured Isfahan. He levied high taxes on the people, and tortured and slew whoever refused. Finally on March 14, 1781, he captured Shiraz, and slew Sadiq Khan, and sat on the throne. Murad continued the war with Agha Mohammad Khan and raised an army allowing his cousin Rustam to command it. Rustam took this army to the province of Mazandaran where he fought against a Qajar army under the command of Ja'far Quli Khan.

The office had its origins in the position of veldwachtmeester in the Dutch Cape colony, and was regarded as being equivalent to a sergeant. The British administration enhanced its importance with the term field cornet, making it equivalent to an officer's rank. The term was used for a civilian official in a local government district (drostdy) of the Cape Colony, acting as and invested with the authority of a military officer and empowered to act as a magistrate. The field cornet was subject to the landdrost of the district and acted as his representative. As such, a field cornet performed important functions in administrative, judicial and police matters. In addition, in peacetime the field cornet was the head of the militia, was responsible for maintaining law and order in his area, and was tasked with supervising the handover of postal items on arrival in his district. The term later came to denote a military rank equivalent to that of a lieutenant in the Boer armies as well as in the South African Army between 1960 and 1968.

Some online forums such as Slashdot and Techdirt do not allow such posts, requiring users to be registered either under their real name or utilizing a pseudonym. Others like JuicyCampus, AutoAdmit, 2channel, and other Futaba-based imageboards (such as 4chan) thrive on anonymity. Users of 4chan, in particular, interact in an anonymous and ephemeral environment that facilitates rapid generation of new trends. History of online anonymity Online anonymity can be traced to Usenet newsgroups in the late 1990s where the notion of using invalid emails for posting to newsgroups was introduced. This was primarily used for discussion on newsgroups pertaining to certain sensitive topics. There was also the introduction of anonymous remailers which were capable of stripping away the sender's address from mail packets before sending them to the receiver. Online services which facilitated anonymous posting sprang up around mid-1992, originating with the cypherpunk group.Rigby, Karina, \\"Anonymity on the Internet Must Be Protected\\" The precursor to Internet forums like 2channel and 4chan were textboards like Ayashii World and Amezou World that provided the ability for anonymous posts in Japan. These \\"large-scale anonymous textboards\\" were inspired by the Usenet culture and were primarily focused on technology, unlike their descendants.\\"Ayashii World\\" Today, image boards receive tremendous internet traffic from all parts of the world. In 2011, on 4chan's most popular board, /b/, there were roughly 35,000 threads and 400,000 posts created per day. At that time, that level of content was on par with YouTube. Such high traffic suggests a broad demand from internet users for anonymous content sharing sites. Levels of anonymity Anonymity on the Internet can pertain to both the utilization of pseudonyms or requiring no authentication at all (also called \\"perfect anonymity\\") for posting on a website.Furukawa, Hideki,\\"Q&A; With the Founder of Channel 2\\" , The Online Journalism Review, August 22, 2008 Online anonymity is also limited by IP addresses. For example, WikiScanner associates anonymous Wikipedia edits with the IP address that made the change and tries to identify the entity that owns the IP address. On other websites, IP addresses may not be publicly available, but they can be obtained from the website administrators only through legal intervention. They might not always be traceable to the poster.\\"Just how do websites track or monitor our activity?\\" Techniques Utilizing pseudonyms allow people to post without revealing their real identity. Pseudonyms, however, are still prone to being tracked to the user's IP address. To avoid being tracked to an IP address, it is possible to post via a public computer where the IP address would usually be under the purview of the public workspace such as a coffee shop, and hence cannot be traced to the individual user. =Memes= Another way people are posting anonymously online is through the use of memes. One popular meme is the Confession Bear meme. People use Confession Bear to post everything from funny and embarrassing stories to very troubled thoughts. =Technology= There are services described as anonymizers which aim to provide users the ability to post anonymously by hiding their identifying information. Anonymizers are essentially proxy servers which act as an intermediary between the user who wants to post anonymously and the website which logs user information such as IP addresses. The proxy server is the only computer in this network which is aware of the user's information and provides its own information to anonymize the poster.Confinet Ltd. \\"Anonymous Surfing\\", AnonIC.org, 2004 Examples of such anonymizers include I2P and Tor, which employ techniques such as onion and garlic routing to provide enhanced encryption to messages that travel through multiple proxy servers. Applications like PGP utilizing techniques like private-key and public-key encryptions are also utilized by users to post content in Usenet groups and other online forums. Legal standards and regulations =China= The revised draft of the Chinese government's \\"Internet Information Services\\"\\"Internet Information Services (revised draft)\\", June 7, 2012 proposes that \\"Internet information service providers, including microblogs, forums, and blogs, that allow users to post information on the Internet should ensure users are registered with their real identities\\".\\"China Proposes Strengthening Internet Guidelines\\", Reuters, June 7, 2012 Starting October 1, 2017, it will require internet users to identify themselves with their real names to use comments sections on news and social media websites.China to ban anonymous online comments ‚Äì China‚Äôs latest society and culture news =The Philippines= The Philippine government passed the Cybercrime Prevention Act on 12 September 2012, which among other things grants the Department of Justice the ability to \\"block access to 'computer data' that is in violation of the Act; in other words, a website hosting criminally libelous speech could be shut down without a court order\\".Jillian C. York, \\"A Dark Day for the Philippines as Government Passes Cybercrime Act\\", Electronic Frontier Foundation, October 3, 2012 =United Kingdom= Under the Defamation Act 2013, in an action against a website operator, on a statement posted on the website, it is a defence to show that it was not the operator who posted the statement on the website. The defence is defeated if it was not possible for the claimant to identify the person who posted the statement. =United States= In the United States, the right to speak anonymously online is protected by the First Amendment and various other laws. These laws restrict the ability of the government and civil litigants to obtain the identity of anonymous speakers. The First Amendment says that \\"Congress shall make no law ‚Ä¶ abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\\".First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution This protection has been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to protect the right to speak anonymously offline. For example, in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, the Supreme Court overturned an Ohio law banning the distribution of anonymous election pamphlets, claiming that an \\"author's decision to remain anonymous ‚Ä¶ is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment\\" and that \\"anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent\\", as well as a \\"shield\\" against the so-called tyranny of the majority.McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995). Various courts have interpreted these offline protections to extend to the online world.See, e.g., Doe v. Cahill, 884 A.2d 451 (Del. 2005); Krinsky v. Doe 6, 159 Cal. App. 4th 1154 (2008). Identifying the author of an anonymous post may require a Doe subpoena. This involves gaining access to the IP address of the poster via the hosting website. The courts can then order an ISP to identify the subscriber to whom it had assigned said IP address. Requests for such data are almost always fruitful, though providers will often effect a finite term of data retention (in accordance with the privacy policy of each‚Äîlocal law may specify a minimum and/or maximum term). The usage of IP addresses has, in recent times, been challenged as a legitimate way to identify anonymous users.Keith Wagstaff, \\"You Are Not an IP Address, Rules Judge\\", Time Magazine, May 7, 2012 On March 21, 2012, the New York State Senate introduced the bill numbered S.6779 (and A.8668) labeled as the \\"Internet Protection Act\\". It proposes the ability of a website administrator of a New York‚Äìbased website to take down anonymous comments unless the original author of the comment agrees to identify themselves on the post.New York State Senate Bill no. S.6779, March 21, 2012. In online communities Online communities vary with their stances on anonymous postings. Wikipedia allows anonymous editing in most cases, but does not label users, instead identifying them by their IP addresses. Other editors commonly refer to these users with neutral terms such as \\"anons\\" or \\"IPs\\".Dwight Silverman, \\"What's Online\\", Houston Chronicle, July 7, 2000, page 2. Many online bulletin boards require users to be signed to write‚Äîand, in some cases, even to read‚Äîposts. 2channel and other Futaba-based image boards take an opposite stance, encouraging the anonymity, and in the case of English- language Futaba-based websites, calling those who use usernames and tripcodes \\"namefags\\" and \\"richeys\\", respectively. As required by law, even communities such as 4chan do require the logging of IP addresses of such anonymous posters. Such data, however, can only be accessed by the particular site administrator. Slashdot discourages anonymous posting by displaying \\"Anonymous Coward\\" as the author of each anonymous post. The mildly derogatory term is meant to chide anonymous contributors into logging in.Stephen Shankland, \\"Andover.Net Scoops Up Seminal Slashdot Site\\", CNet News, June 29, 1999. (Stating that the term \\"Anonymous Coward\\" was popularized by Slashdot.) Ramifications =Effects on users= The effects of posting online anonymously has been linked to the online disinhibition effect in users whilst been categorized into either benign or toxic disinhibition. Disinhibition can result in misbehavior but can also improve user relationships. It may also result in greater disclosure among Internet users, allowing more emotional closeness and openness in a safe social context. Anonymous computer communication has also been linked to accentuate self-stereotyping. Although it has been linked to notable effects in gender differences, only when the topic bears similarity and fits with the gender stereotype. A 2015 study suggested that anonymous news comment sections are more susceptible to uncivil comments, especially those directed at other users. Anonymous news comment section users are also more likely to be impolite by either being sarcastic and casting aspersions. With regard to a recent hostile subpoena in California, commentators have asked if there will be a \\"Layfield & Barrett effect\\" chilling job review posting free speech.http://lawandmore.typepad.com/law_and_more/2016/05/anonymous-posting- will-there-be-a-layfield-barrett-effect.html Law and More: Deconstructing What Happens In Law, May 17, 2016, Anonymous Posting - Will there be a Layfield & Barrett Effect?http://speechwriting- ghostwriting.typepad.com/speechwriting_ghostwritin/2016/05/glassdoor-will- layfield-barrett-subpoena-scare-off-employees-from-ranting.html Jane Genova, Speechwriter-Ghostwriter Blog, May 16, 2016, \\"Glassdoor - Will Layfield & Barrett Subpoena Scare Off Employees from Ranting?\\" On May 2, 2016, through its lawyers, Layfield and Barrett and partner Phil Layfield issued a subpoena on Glassdoor seeking the online identities of former employees who posted extremely critical and negative reviews. Glassdoor executives have stated that they will fight the subpoena as they have fought off other efforts to disclose anonymous identities in the recent past.http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202749188614/Glassdoor-Fights-Subpoena- Seeking-Identity-of-Commenter?slreturn=20160422220341 The Recorder, Feb. 8, 2016, \\"Glassdoor Fights Subpoena Seeking Identity of Commenter\\" Other litigants in California have won their right to anonymously post negative job reviews but the law remains hotly contested.http://www.dmlp.org/threats/krinsky-v-doe-6 Digital Media Law Project, Krinsky v. Doe, 2008http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=52db6564-e0f4-42eb- abec-c8f109de42a5 Lexicology.com, March 24, 2016, \\"Opinions, Everyone's Got One\\". =Effects on online communities= The conditions for deindividuation, such as \\"anonymity, reduced self-awareness, and reduced self-regulation\\", fosters creations of online communities much in the same way that they might be employed offline. This is evident in proliferation of communities such as Reddit or 4chan which utilize total anonymity or pseudonymity, or tools such as Informers (which add anonymity to non anonymous social media like Facebook or Twitter), to provide its users the ability to post varied content. The effect of disinhibition has been seen to be beneficial in \\"advice and discussion threads by providing a cover for more intimate and open conversations\\". The \\"ephemerality,\\" or the short-lived nature, of the posts that exist on some anonymous image boards such as 4chan create a fast paced environment. As of 2009, threads on 4chan had a median lifespan of 3.9 minutes. There is also research suggesting that content that gets posted in such communities also tends to be more deviant in nature than would be otherwise. The ability to post anonymously has also been linked to the proliferation of pornography in newsgroups and other online forums wherein users utilize sophisticated mechanisms such as mentioned in technology.

Its route follows the Bundesautobahn 3 for the greater part, and currently the travel time is about 62 minutes. The line's grades of up to four percent require trains with a high power-to-weight ratio which is currently only met by third-generation Intercity-Express trains. It was constructed between 1995 and 2002 at a total cost of six billion Euro according to Deutsche Bahn.  Operational use  The line starts in Cologne at the Abzweig K√∂ln-Steinstrasse in the Cologne borough of Porz. Whilst the connection loop to Cologne-Bonn Airport, the Cologne Airport loop, is technically not a part of the high-speed line, it was built as a part of the general refurbishments in the Cologne area due to the line, and hence is generally regarded as part of the project. The line has four stations, Siegburg/Bonn, Montabaur, Limburg S√ºd and Frankfurt Airport. The line is equipped for speeds up to 300 km/h between Siegburg and Frankfurt, closely following the A3 autobahn.  History  K√∂ln Hauptbahnhof Six track section near Porz Wied viaduct Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof The former Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) began planning for a network of high-speed lines for both passenger and freight trains in the 1960s. The 1973 federal transport plan included a high- speed line between Cologne and Gro√ü-Gerau (near Frankfurt), as well as between Hanover and W√ºrzburg and between Mannheim and Stuttgart. This plan envisaged that mixed traffic would require: *maximum grade of 1.25% (occasionally 2.0%) *curves with small superelevation and minimum radii of 4,800 m to 7,000 m *maximum line speed of 250 to 300 km/h These specifications would be difficult to achieve either near the traditional Rhine valley route, which follows an entrenched meander, or along DB's preferred route next to the A3, which has long and steep climbs and descents. The second federal transport plan in 1985 (which was drawn up when the first TGV line had been operating for four years) included a passenger train-only railway, which meant that much steeper grades would be acceptable. The technical standards adopted were: *maximum grade : 4.0% *minimum radius : 3,350 m *maximum speed : 300 km/h (186 mph) DB negotiated with the states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse over the route. Each state had objections to the bypassing of the cities on the Rhine, particularly Bonn, Andernach, Koblenz, Mainz and Wiesbaden and four other routes were examined that passed through some of these. No agreement was reached and the Federal Cabinet agreed on 20 December 1989 to a recommendation of the Transport Minister to adopt the A3 route and, among other things, to include a station at Limburg. DB then consulted with the states and community groups over the details of the route. In North Rhine- Westphalia there was considerable debate over the location of the station to serve the Bonn area and on how to serve the Cologne-Bonn Airport. DB decided that the station would be built at Siegburg and that a separate, double line would connect Cologne and the high-speed line to the south with Cologne-Bonn airport for the S-Bahn and ICE traffic. In Rhineland-Palatinate, DB decided that a station would be built north of Montabaur only 21 km north of Limburg Sud, partly to serve Koblenz via the A48, and to reroute a local railway through it. In Hesse, DB decided to build the Limburg station south of the town at its current location on cost grounds, even though this prevented a connection to the Lahn valley line, which would have provided a connection to Koblenz and Gie√üen. Options for connections to Wiesbaden were examined in detail, including routing the line through its eastern outskirts. DB eventually agreed to a double-line spur to Wiesbaden along the A66. Options for connections to Frankfurt Airport, the line to Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof and to the Riedbahn (the line to Mannheim). It was decided that routing the line into the existing Frankfurt Airport station (now known as the regional train station) with two 400 m-long tracks and a 200 m-long track would not be adequate, even if expanded to four or five tracks. DB decided that a separate station across the A3 from the old station would be required and that the line would go on to connect to the Riedbahn both northbound (towards Frankfurt) and southbound (towards Mannheim). = Planning = Although the route as set out above was adopted under the federal railway development law on 15 November 1993, the last legal challenge to the project was not resolved until September 1998.Ein Jahrzehnt f√ºr 58 Minuten in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 12 July 2001 In the meantime DB decided to reduce the minimum radius of curves to 3,320 meters and increased the maximum super-elevation of the track to 180 mm (to follow the A3 more closely), reduced the spacing between tracks from 4.70 to 4.50 m (to save space) and increased the area of tunnel cross-sections from 82 to 92 m2 (to allow higher speeds for converging trains). The route as finally designed was intended to allow trains to cover the distance between Cologne and Frankfurt in 58 minutes,Letzte Gleise der neuen ICE-Strecke verlegt in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 11 July 2001 although the current fastest time is 70 minutes, due to uncompleted work at rail junctions in Cologne and Frankfurt.Based on winter timetable 2006/2007 = Construction = The construction of the route began on 13 December 1995 with the turning of the first sod at the Frankfurter Kreuz autobahn junction and the last dispute over the route was settled in May 1997. On 13 May Federal Minister of Transport Matthias Wissmann in Siegburg turned the first sod in North Rhine- Westphalia. The last section to commence construction was the Schloss-R√∂ttgen tunnel on the Cologne-Bonn airport loop, which was required in the settlement of a law case: work on it commenced in December 2000. The first section completed was the new Frankfurt airport station, which went into operation on 30 May 1999. The opening of the whole route, which had originally been planned for 1999, took place after numerous court challenges and geological problems, at the end of July 2002. The last tracks of the route in the Schulwald tunnel were installed on 10 July 2001. In the same month the first trips with diesel locomotives were run to adjust the height of the overhead electric lines on the southern section. On 22 October 2001 for the first time an ICE 3 ran on the line, on a 37 km long section between Frankfurt airport and Idstein. During construction, traffic on the neighbouring A3 was significantly affected and up to 48 building sites with a reduced maximum speed of 100 km/h were operating simultaneously on the autobahn. Up to 15,000 people were employed on the construction of the railway line. 7.5 million m¬≥ of earth was removed during the tunnel construction and approximately 3 million m¬≥ concrete were poured. 1,400 miners were hired and 13 people died in accidents in the building of the tunnels. = Opening and start-up = The symbolic opening of the line took place on 25 July 2002 with a special train carrying approximately 700 honoured guests. On 1 August 2002, the first passenger services commenced, originally with a two-hourly service and later with an hourly service. In December 2002, the full service commenced, integration into the European timetable, although there were many disruptions to services in the first few months due to technical failures. On 13 June 2004 the Cologne Bonn Airport loop was put into service. At the end of September 2004 the Siegburg/Bonn station was finally completed. Route In Cologne ICE trains follow three paths to reach the high-speed line: *from the north (D√ºsseldorf or Wuppertal), running via the low level of Cologne Messe/Deutz railway station (tracks 11 and 12) *from the west (Aachen) through Cologne main station and over the Hohenzollern Bridge or from the north to the main station and then reversing to re-cross the Hohenzollern Bridge *from the north over the Hohenzollern Bridge to the main station and continuing around the western bypass of central Cologne and over the Cologne south bridge The first two routes allow trains to run via Cologne‚ÄìBonn airport loop line, rejoining the main route at Cologne-Porz-Wahn. The high-speed line's dedicated track begins in Cologne-Porz and are located between the Sieg Railway and the line from Gremberg yard and the Cologne south bridge, which, in effect, becomes the Right Rhine line when it separates at Troisdorf. Between Porz and Troisdorf there are six parallel lines and the speed limit on the HSL is 200 km/h. At Troisdorf the HSL runs through a 627 m tunnel under connecting lines that allow passenger trains running on the Sieg line to transfer to the Right Rhine line and freight trains on the freight lines to transfer to the Sieg line (and vice versa for northbound trains). In Troisdorf the Right Rhine line leaves the high-speed line and runs through Bonn-Beuel towards Koblenz. The HSL follows the Siegstrecke to the rebuilt Siegburg/Bonn station and then heads south to run through the Siegauen Tunnel under the Sieg. At that very point it joins the A3, which it parallels south bound towards Frankfurt Airport. Between the Siegauen Tunnel and the Main Bridge (near Frankfurt) the speed limit is 300 km/h and from there to the airport station trains run at 160 to 220 km/h. In the Wiesbaden suburb of Breckenheim a double line connects to Wiesbaden, partly next to the A66 and then next to the L√§ndches Railway. Trains run into the Wiesbaden terminal station and can then reverse out to go to Mainz and Mannheim. The 13.2-kilometer-long Wiesbaden branch has a maximum speed of about 160 km/h. =Construction on the approach to Cologne= Work is being carried out to create separate tracks for the high-speed line through the heavily used Cologne rail junction from its provisional connection to the conventional line at K√∂ln Steinstra√üe, where trains are limited to 130 km/h through the points. The line is being extended to Cologne-M√ºlheim station through Cologne Messe/Deutz railway station (low level). This work was intended to be part of the original high-speed line project, but was dropped to reduce costs. When completed in 2008 this work will reduce the time between Frankfurt and D√ºsseldorf by 10 minutes.

Shown each year on Super Bowl Sunday, the show consists of footage of a batch of puppies at play inside a model stadium, with commentary on their actions. The first Puppy Bowl was shown on February 6, 2005, opposite Super Bowl XXXIX. The puppies featured in the Puppy Bowl are from shelters. Production According to the show's producers, the inspiration for Puppy Bowl as Super Bowl counterprogramming came from the popular Yule Log Christmas program.The Puppy Bowl, explained - Vox Several months of planning occur before each show, which is usually filmed in October. A veterinarian is on site during the production of Puppy Bowl to ensure animal safety and well-being, and to administer any veterinary medical care which might be needed. Representatives from American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as well as the shelters which lend their animals to the production, are also on-site as observers to ensure animal welfare standards are maintained. In 2012, an American Humane Association representative was always on-site to ensure that puppies did not become too aggressive and injure one another. According to its associate producer, about 53 hours of filming are needed to produce a single Puppy Bowl. In 2007, shooting occurred over three days. Roughly 30 staff members were needed in 2008 to produce the show. In 2010, the veterinarian on site said filming was spread over three days, while in 2015 filming occurred in 12-hour blocks over two days. Puppies are given a rest period every 30 minutes, due to the heat from the lights. Forty-six puppies were used in 2008, and about 60 puppies in 2010. The 2011 production occurred in the New York City area in the fall of 2010, using 47 puppies, while the 2012 show featured 58 puppies. The 2013 show (filmed at a television studio in west midtown in Manhattan) featured 63 puppies, with 10 on the \\"field\\" at one time. Filming occurred over two days. The 2014 episode was filmed October 2 to 4, 2013, at the Chelsea Broadcast Center in Manhattan, New York City. A staff of 49 Animal Planet employees and 48 volunteers wrangled the animals, with each puppy assigned a single human overseer. Kittens and cats were filmed the first day, puppies and dogs the second, and other animals on the fourth. A total of 66 puppies were used for the show in 2014, including a basset hound with a genetic defect to its paw. This allowed 12 to 15 puppies to be on the field at a time, and for puppies to be given rest periods every 20 minutes. Another 30 untrained kittens, five penguins, three trained adult cats, eight \\"tailgate party\\" dogs, four police dogs, and six hamsters were used in the 2014 show. All the animals except the penguins (which were provided by the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium) are adoptable. In 2015, 37 shelters from around the United States and Puerto Rico submitted 85 puppies for the event, of which 55 puppies were chosen to be on the air. Another 25 kittens were used for the half-time show. Forty-four shelters and rescue groups in 25 states provided 49 animals in 2016. (Eighty- eight animals \\"auditioned\\".) Filming returned to an eight-hour-a-day, three- day format in 2016, with two days used for filming puppies and one day for kittens and other animals. Sixty personnel were needed for filming. Puppies were grouped by size (small, medium, and large) for on-field play. For Puppy Bowl XIII, 34 shelters and rescue organizations in 22 states and Puerto Rico provided the 78 puppies featured on the show. Puppy Bowl is filmed inside a miniature Plexiglas \\"stadium\\" that is long by wide. Only puppies between 12 and 21 weeks old are allowed on the show, and there is a height and weight limit due to the size limitations of the play area. Puppies must show that they are well-socialized with people and other puppies, and that they have the full range of vaccinations. A wide variety of toys are placed inside the \\"stadium\\". Although there is no minimum or maximum limit on how many toys may be in the stadium, show producers say that toys which make the loudest noise or which are sausage-shaped get the most attention. Toys are usually switched out every 20 minutes, and often more frequently. Peanut butter is smeared around camera lenses to induce the puppies to lick the camera. About of peanut butter are used for the taping, along with of dry dog food, 500 doggie treats, and 250 toys. The various cameras used to tape the show generated about 50 hours of footage in 2011, but more than 90 hours in 2012 (for the 2013 airing). Some cameras are placed inside toys, to give a puppy's-eye view of the action. In 2015, 18 cameras were used, and several weeks were needed to edit the footage into a two-hour program. Fifteen cameras were used in 2016, and more than 100 hours of footage generated for the 2017 show. The first five Puppy Bowls were narrated by Harry Kalas, a narrator for NFL Films and longtime play-by-play voice of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Puppy Bowls from 2010 to 2011 were narrated by Jeff Bordner and then by Scott Graham from 2012 onward. Format The Puppy Bowl consists of a number of puppies playing in a model stadium (\\"GEICO Stadium\\") with no audience (but with canned audience cheering), minimal commentary, and instant replay shots. A \\"bowl cam\\" provides shots upwards through the transparent bottom of a special water bowl built into the stadium floor, with a wide-angle lens that allows viewers to watch the puppies drink water (and walk through it) up close. Ten full-size digital cameras and five GoPro miniature digital cameras were used in 2014 to capture the action. These numbers include the hidden cameras in the water bowl and toys. A human \\"referee\\" watches over the \\"action on the field.\\" In the first few years of Puppy Bowl, this was a crew member randomly selected each year. Beginning in 2008, it was Animal Planet associate producer Andrew Schechter. For the 2012 Puppy Bowl, Schechter was replaced by SportsNet New York and Beer Money! host Dan Schachner, who has hosted the show ever since. He auditioned by submitting a tape showing him trying to organize a dog football game among unwitting dog-owners at a public park. Football terminology is often used by the announcer and referee to illustrate the puppies' behavior and actions. When a puppy drags one of the football-shaped toys into the end zone, a \\"puppy touchdown\\" is declared. There are no hard-and-fast rules about what constitutes a score. (In Puppy Bowl IX, there was a double-touchdown, as puppies with toys raced into each end zone simultaneously. In 2016, a \\"team touchdown\\" occurred as two puppies carried the same toy into the end zone.) \\"Penalties\\" are issued for puppies relieving themselves on the field. Timeouts are called if the water bowl needs to be refilled, or if the puppies begin to fight (a behavior called \\"unnecessary rrruff-ness\\"). The show uses puns to mimic the rules of professional football, including paws interference (pass interference), ruff sides (offsides), and dog-collar tackle (horse-collar tackle). Unique \\"penalties\\" called may also include howling, illegal bathing (playing in the water bowl), napping on the field, premature watering of the lawn (urination), \\"excessive fertilization\\" (defecation), \\"neutral bone infraction\\" (neutral zone infraction), and \\"ineligible retriever downfield\\" (ineligible receiver downfield). Three special \\"penalty calls\\" were introduced in 2015: \\"Terrorizing the ref\\" (for a puppy who acts aggressively toward the referee), \\"paws interference\\" (for when a puppy blocks another) and \\"Pancaking\\" (for when a tired puppy sprawls on the floor instead of playing). Each year, a Most Valuable Puppy (or MVP) is chosen at the end of the show for the puppy considered to be the stand-out performer of the event. Beginning with Puppy Bowl XI, viewers were allowed to vote for the MVP. MVP voting was permitted for the programs first three airings (3 PM, 5 PM, and 7 PM). Although puppies may urinate or defecate on the field as frequently as once every 20 seconds, all but one of the incidents is edited out of the show. In 2016, 315 plastic bags were needed to retrieve feces, and more than 1,500 absorbent pads used to clean up urination. Puppies occasionally engage in sexual activity, but this is edited out of the program. The running time of Puppy Bowls I through IV was 180 minutes (including commercials). The running time of Puppy Bowl V was decreased to 120 minutes (including commercials). Jessie Dinh, producer at Discovery Studios, explained the reason for the decrease: \\"We only did two hours this year so that we had the opportunity to include some other fun elements.\\" =Team Ruff vs. Team Fluff= 2015's Puppy Bowl XI introduced team-based competition to Puppy Bowl for the first time. Puppies were divided into two teams, each identifiable by a different colored bandanna worn throughout the event. Points were tallied on a scoreboard powered by a hamster running on a wheel. The team with the most points was declared the victor. Team Ruff overwhelmed their opponents 87-to-49 to become the first-ever Puppy Bowl champions. In Puppy Bowl XII, Team Ruff won again by a score of 70‚Äì44. In Puppy Bowl XIII, Team Fluff upset the heavily favored Team Ruff by a score of 93‚Äì38. In Puppy Bowl XIV, Team Fluff won again in a close margin of 52‚Äì47. In Puppy Bowl XV, Team Ruff overturned Team Fluff's winning streak by a score of 59‚Äì51. In Puppy Bowl XVI, Team Fluff returned to winning by a score of 63‚Äì59. =Kitty Half-Time Show= Starting with Puppy Bowl II, at the 1 hour, 15 minute mark, the puppies leave the field and a large scratching post is brought out with a wide variety of kittens for the Kitty Half-Time Show. This features kittens playing for 30 minutes with lights, laser pens, balls of yarn, a scratching post, flint sweepers, and a wide variety of other toys. The grand finale of the Puppy Bowl II Half-Time Show was a confetti blast that sent most of the cats running away scared. Puppy Bowl III did not show the cats' departure from the field. The halftime show of Puppy Bowl IV in 2008 was only 15 minutes in length. In 2012, Animal Planet said that 20 kittens would be part of the Kitty Half-Time Show. This number increased to 21 for the 2013 airing. All the kittens are also animals from shelters, and are adoptable. The \\"stadium\\" is outfitted with a variety of scratching posts and toys that move to interest the kittens and encourage them to move about. This does not usually work, however, and catnip is distributed over the set to help the kittens be more active and interested in their surroundings. =Other features= In 2009, a model blimp (supposedly floating over the Puppy Bowl) was added. The \\"blimp\\" mimics the appearance of the Goodyear Blimp over many outdoor football events. Shots of the puppies at play were green-screened into the windows to make it appear as if the \\"blimp\\" was actually hovering over the field. Inside the model of the blimp's control room, hamsters are allowed to play (as if they were the crew of the blimp). The blimp returned in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Beginning in 2010, \\"bunny cheerleaders\\" (rabbits) were shown, as if these animals were on the sidelines. In 2011, the \\"bunny cheerleaders\\" were replaced by \\"chicken cheerleaders\\" (hens and roosters). The bunnies and chickens were replaced by five pigs in a \\"Piggy Pep Squad\\" in 2012. Hedgehog cheerleaders were introduced for 2013, but replaced with penguins in 2014. Also beginning in 2010, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) began sponsoring the Puppy Bowl. A veterinarian was shown giving each puppy a physical prior to participation, provided care to any animal which might appear injured, and provided tips to viewers about proper animal care. Dr. Elisa Mazzaferro, Director of Emergency Services at Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital in Denver, Colorado, provided the official on-camera care for the puppies and other animals. A new element for 2011 was a parody of the popular \\"Kiss Cam\\" used at sporting events. The \\"Kiss Cam\\" returned in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Two other new elements were added in 2012 as well. A cockatiel named \\"Meep\\" \\"tweeted\\" about the game from the sidelines (using the Twitter social media network). Jill Rappaport, a TV reporter and animal advocate, provided color commentary. The hamsters in the blimp and Meep the \\"tweeting\\" cockatiel were retained for the 2013 show, but the piglet cheerleaders were replaced by baby hedgehogs in tutus. Owners of hedgehogs volunteered the use of their animals for the show. The tutus, however, did not stay on the animals. A new \\"Puppy Cam\\" (a miniature wide camera attached to a puppy's collar) was added in place of the \\"Kiss Cam\\", to provide viewers with a puppy's-eye-view of the action. A new feature in the 2013 game is the \\"Cute Cam,\\" the slow-mo camera. Additionally, the human \\"stars\\" of Animal Planet's reality TV shows were added in 2013 as commentators. Another addition is a \\"special puppy hot tub\\" (a large pan of water) in which puppies will relax prior to or after their time on the field. For the 2014 edition of the Puppy Bowl, the tenth anniversary of the show, First Lady Michelle Obama opened the show with footage of puppies \\"training\\" for the Puppy Bowl on the South Lawn of the White House. Police dogs appeared on the field when the national anthem was played. Returning as the official \\"tweeter\\" of the show was Meep the cockatiel. The dwarf cat Lil Bub was added as a \\"commentator\\" broadcasting from a Chicago studio. In reference to the Super Bowl's halftime show with Bruno Mars, Keyboard Cat \\"played\\" his song \\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" during the halftime show. The half-time show also featured 30 kittens toppling dominoes and a kitten \\"parachuting\\" onto the field. To increase interactivity with fans of the show, the Puppy Bowl X online site allowed fans to play a \\"Fantasy Puppy League\\" (similar to fantasy football) featuring the 2014 puppies, gave fans the chance to vote for the \\"Most Valuable Puppy\\" during the event, and gave viewers the opportunity to post photos of their own animals and Puppy Bowl parties via Instagram. Entertainment Weekly reporter James Hibbered commented on the changes by noting, \\"Animal Planet is simply embracing viral- video favorites and ratcheting up the sports-spoof silliness to a new level this year.\\" With the Super Bowl in New York City where the Puppy Bowl is filmed, Animal Planet established a \\"Puppy Bowl Experience\\" at the Discovery Times Square exhibition space. The \\"experience\\" included a area where people could play with puppies, a recreation of the Puppy Bowl set, and advertising sponsor areas. An emphasis on adopting pets from shelters became a focus of the show in 2014 as well. A total of 33 shelters from 18 states and the territory of Puerto Rico supplied shelter animals (dogs, cats, hamsters, etc.) for the Puppy Bowl. All the animals on the show (except for the penguins) are shelter animals, and usually all are adopted by the time the show airs. Throughout the program, updates on the status of each of the adopted puppies was given. Throughout the program, however, the adoption journey of Rosie (now named Scout), a three-month-old Chihuahua/terrier mix, was followed from her arrival at the shelter to her life with her new family. Puppy Bowl XI featured five Nigerian dwarf goats as cheerleaders. \\"Katty Furry\\", a cat depicted playing Katy Perry songs in YouTube videos, was the \\"half-time performer\\". MVPs were chosen in each of the program's first three airings. Puppies were divided for the first time into teams, and a hamster-powered scoreboard kept score. Celebrities such as Andy Cohen, Whitney Cummings, and Reese Witherspoon appeared on the program to root for \\"their team\\", and an animated short featuring The Simpsons played during the show. Animals with substantial followings on Instagram had images submitted, showing their support for each team as well. A fantasy football draft was introduced to allow fans to pick the puppy they felt would score the most points. Puppy Bowl XII was preceded by \\"Road to the Puppy Bowl\\" events across the United States in fall and winter 2015. Local animal shelters and rescue groups partnered with Animal Planet on these events, during which thousands of animals were adopted. Turbo the tortoise suffered a wardrobe malfunction (inspired by the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy) during the half-time entertainment. Silkie chickens served as cheerleaders, and a skunk helped referee the show. The 2017 Puppy Bowl XIII featured three special-needs dogs: Doobert, who is deaf; Lucky, who had her right front leg amputated; and Winston, who is both sight- and hearing-impaired. An hour-long \\"pre-game show\\", scheduled to air an hour prior to the Puppy Bowl, and a \\"Puppy Bowl Virtual Reality\\" feature (the game seen through the eyes of a puppy), were also added. Halftime entertainment featured \\"Kitty Gaga\\" and the Chicago Rock Cats. Guinea pigs and rabbits were the 2017 cheerleaders, and famous pets of Instagram returned. For the first time, Team Ruff and Team Fluff competed for the fictional \\"Lombarky Trophy\\" (a parody of the Lombardi Trophy), and each team had a mascot (a rescued screech owl for Team Ruff, and a rescued chinchilla for Team Fluff). Puppy Bowls Reception =Ratings= Puppy Bowl III, which aired on February 4, 2007, increased that number by 50 percent to 7.5 million viewers. Puppy Bowl IV, which aired on Animal Planet on February 3, 2008, had more than 8 million viewers for all its broadcasts, for a total increase of 1060 percent from its first airing in 2005. It was also the first Puppy Bowl broadcast in high definition. Puppy Bowl VI aired on February 7, 2010, and a record 1.1 million viewers watched the first broadcast alone. Puppy Bowl VII aired on February 6, 2011 with a total of 9.2 million viewers over the twelve hours it was aired. The actual premiere drew 1.7 million viewers, up 60 percent from last year. Puppy Bowl VII in 2011 had a total 9.2 million estimated viewers for all airings. Puppy Bowl VIII aired on February 5, 2012. This airing was the second most-watched social television program in America, with more than 10 million viewers over five airings. This included an increase of 17 percent in ratings in its target demographic group (adults age 25-to-54). More than 200,000 Puppy Bowl-related tweets were made on that day. Puppy Bowl X aired six times over 12 hours on February 2, 2014, with new content added for each airing. A record 13.5 million people watched the show's six airings. Puppy Bowl XI aired on February 1, 2015, and was watched by 2,767,000 viewers in its initial airing. Puppy Bowl XII aired on February 7, 2016, and was watched by about 2.2 million viewers in its initial airing (a drop of about 21 percent over 2015), and 9.3 million viewers (including time-shifted viewing) over all airings. It was the number one non-sports program on cable among adults aged 25-to-54 and among women aged 18-to-49 during its initial 3 PM-to-5 PM airing. It was the number two most-watched program on all television (cable and broadcast) from 3 PM- to-5 PM among adults aged 25-to-54 and among women aged 18-to-49. Only the Super Bowl itself had more viewers. This was the fourth year in a row that the Puppy Bowl's initial airing was the second most-watched program in the nation those demographic groups. Puppy Bowl XVI aired on February 2, 2020. Advertising revenue for the 2013 show was up 19 percent over 2012, and drew a number of new advertisers. For the first time, Animal Planet allowed commercial branding of its \\"stadium\\" in 2013 as well. It was referred to throughout the program as the \\"GEICO Puppy Bowl Stadium\\". An aggregate of 12.4 million viewers watched part of all six airings of the Puppy Bowl in 2013. Advertising revenue for the 2014 Puppy Bowl rose 30 percent over 2013. Three new companies became sponsors of the show, and Mars, Incorporated's Sheba cat food company sponsored a new \\"cat VIP suite\\". Spin-offs and competition =Puppy Games= A spinoff of the Puppy Bowl, known as Puppy Games, aired opposite NBC's primetime broadcast of the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics on August 8, 2008. The Puppy Games included swimming, gymnastics, boxing, and soccer, and kittens were used for the \\"opening ceremony.\\" John Ramey and Mary Beth Smith, respectively, served as the play- by-play announcer and color commentator for the event.15 Fun Facts About Puppy BowlMental Floss =Dog Bowl= Another spinoff, the Dog Bowl, aired on February 3, 2018, a day before Puppy Bowl XIV. It features 50 dogs ages 2‚Äì15 years separated into \\"Oldies\\" and \\"Goldies\\" and promotes the adoption of older dogs. A second edition, Dog Bowl II, aired February 2, 2019. A third edition, Dog Bowl III, aired on February 1, 2020. =Competitive shows= The Puppy Bowl is the inspiration for Hallmark Channel's Kitten Bowl, which first aired in 2014. The Puppy Bowl also inspired the Fish Bowl, four hours of goldfish swimming in a bowl, which first aired in 2014 on the Nat Geo Wild cable network. In 2018, Blizzard hosted an Overwatch-themed Puppy Rumble featuring two teams of puppies playing capture the flag to celebrate in Year of the Dog in-game event and promote adoption. The event was broadcast live on Twitch.

Working mostly in French, except for their international prank calls, they appear on the afternoon program Les Cerveaux de l'info on CKOI-FM in Montreal. Past victims of their pranks have included Gilles Duceppe, rock stars Bono and Mick Jagger, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Formula One driver Jacques Villeneuve, U.S. business tycoon Donald Trump, and 2008 United States Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The duo have also been incorrectly credited with a prank call to Queen Elizabeth II in 1995, which was in fact placed by another CKOI-FM host, Pierre Brassard, from Les Bleu Poudre. Audette and Trudel met as classmates at Coll√®ge Jean-de-Br√©beuf in Montr√©al. Notable pranks At a campaign appearance in Joliette during the 2004 election campaign, the duo ‚Äî accompanied by a mascot in a tiger costume ‚Äî presented Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe with a petition demanding the reduction of gasoline prices. In August 2005, the pair got Britney Spears to take a call by pretending to be C√©line Dion (they claim to have previously pranked Dion herself). As Dion, they proposed to Spears that \\"Tiger Woods, one of my personal friends, just promised me he's going to sing a very special song in duo with you and it's going to be called 'Let's Make a Hole in One'\\", to which Spears responded with enthusiasm.Masked Avengers Prank Britney On January 27, 2006, they tricked Jacques Chirac into believing that he was speaking to new Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a prank which Chirac took with good humour. The BBC rated this particular prank one of the 30 best moments in radio history of all time. In early May 2007, they called newly elected French President Nicolas Sarkozy, again posing as Stephen Harper. =Sarah Palin= The duo pranked American vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin on November 1, 2008.Palin pranked by \\"Sarkozy\\", BBC News, November 1, 2008.Sarah Palin duped by prank call, BBC, 2 November 2008 Posing as Sarkozy, their discussion with Palin touched on politics, Sarkozy's wife Carla Bruni, hunting by helicopter -- \\"Like we say in French, on pourrait tuer des b√©b√© phoques aussi\\" (\\"We could kill baby seals also\\") -- and the perils of hunting with Dick Cheney. Although the caller identified Sarkozy's advisor on American relations as Johnny Hallyday, and also named Stef Carse as the Prime Minister of Canada and their Les Cerveaux de l'info co-host Richard Z. Sirois as the Premier of Quebec,Although the term they used was in fact \\"Prime Minister of Quebec\\", this is merely an atypical usage and not an inherently incorrect or deliberately misleading one. While Canadian English has a usage convention of reserving the title \\"Prime Minister\\" for the Prime Minister of Canada and using \\"Premier\\" for the equivalent position in a province or territory, in their actual meanings the terms are strictly interchangeable. Furthermore, Canadian French does not have separate words for the two positions, using premier ministre for both ‚Äî accordingly, when speaking English, Canadian francophones will often refer to the prime minister of a province. Palin remained unaware during the six-minute call that it was a prank.Goldenberg, Suzanne. \\"Joke on Palin again as she falls for fake Sarkozy call\\" The Guardian, November 3, 2008. They also referred to the Hustler porn film Who's Nailin' Paylin? as a documentary about Palin, to which the real Palin replied, \\"Oh good, thank you.\\" The call to Palin was vetted by her foreign policy aide, Stephen E. Biegun, who took full responsibility for allowing the vice presidential candidate to take the call. =George W. Bush= According to sources revealed on April 1, 2009, The Masked Avengers tricked the staff of the White House in 2007, while George W. Bush was still president of the United States. Calling from Montreal through Paris, France, to avoid being traced back, The Masked Avengers posed as aides to President Sarkozy, tricking a White House operator into giving a direct phone number to the Situation Room, so they could speak with President Bush. However, the real Sarkozy had already spoken to Bush earlier in the day. The pranksters gave an alibi, saying that he would like to give Bush support, and wanted to talk more about it. After getting through to the Situation Room, they were asked to call back in 15 to 20 minutes‚Äîthe operator even gave the pranksters the direct phone number. The censored recording of the prank was not made public until April Fool's Day 2009, when CKOI aired the stunt. The delay was due to an agreement with the US government to wait until Bush has left office, due to security concerns.AFP, via Yahoo: \\"Canadian radio pranksters hit White House in 2007\\", 3/31/2009.JUSTICIERS MASQU√âS Un autre coup fumant, Le Journal de Montr√©al, March 31, 2009 Notes References External links *Official website *PUR Communications Agency Category:Canadian radio personalities Category:Canadian radio comedy Category:Canadian comedy duos Category:Pranksters ","title":"Masked Avengers (duo)"},{"id":"3907669","title":"Alun Armstrong (footballer)"},{"id":"3907670","title":"Liz White (actress)"},{"id":"3907678","text":"Camley Street Natural Park is an urban nature reserve in King's Cross in central London and within the London Borough of Camden. It is a local nature reserve. Since December 2017, the park has been undergoing reconstruction and has been temporarily closed to the public. Description A pond in Camley Street Natural Park. Comprising of land on the banks of the Regent's Canal - by St Pancras Lock and adjoining St Pancras Basin, the park is both a sanctuary for wildlife and an educational centre, forming \\"a lovely oasis\\". It is run by the London Wildlife Trust. A visitors' centre caters for casual visitors and school parties, though tours must be booked. In shape the park is a narrow strip of land bounded by the canal, Camley Street and Goods Way. The entrance is through an ornate gate on Camley Street. Admission to the park is free. Its opening hours and days change with the funding it is able to win. Ecology A variety of habitats co-exist in the park's small environs, including wetlands, meadow and woodland, which attract insects, amphibians, birds, and at least six species of mammal. Over 300 higher plants have been found at the site; highlights include common broomrape (Orobanche minor), hairy buttercup (Ranunculus sardous) and common spotted orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii). The site is divided into the following habitats: * A summer- flowering meadow, * A pond with varying water level, dependent on the canal water level, * Marshland with reed bed, * Coppiced woodland, * Deciduous woodland, * Mixed woodland with scrub, * Mixed woodland with hedgerow, * Dipping pond (with boardwalk), * Rainwater ponds. Meadow herbs include white clover and poppy. Woodland trees include hazel, rowan, hawthorn and silver birch. Hazel and willow are coppiced regularly. Woodland herbs include lesser celandine and wild violet. Marshland herbs include marsh marigold, greater pond sedge, pendulous sedge, reed, bogbean, mallow and yellow iris. Marsh- nesting birds include reed bunting, moorhen, coot and reed warbler. History Until the 17th century the area was in the Middlesex woodlands. In the 18th century it came under industrial use, and the Regent's Canal was built along the eastern edge of the former country estate. In the 19th century the area was used for coal chutes, first for the canal and then for the Midland Railway. Camley Street was originally known as Cambridge Street, until renamed by the LCC. The site became derelict by the 1970s. In 1984, Camden Borough Council assigned the nascent London Wildlife Trust to manage the site. The park opened in 1985. In 2008, King's Cross Central started to plan a major development to the east and south of the park, with a footbridge across the Regent's Canal into the park. Activities The park hosts pond dipping and wildlife watching sessions for children. Its visitor centre is used by the Wildlife Watch Club. Value According to the Mayor of London's Biodiversity Strategy, \\"Camley Street Natural Park, in particular, has demonstrated that a valuable wildlife space can be created from nothing to become a hub of communal and educational activity, supporting wildlife such as the reed warbler in a place where this would otherwise be unthinkable. Visitors from far and wide come to learn from this example.\\"  See also  * Camden parks and open spaces  External links  * London Wildlife Trust - Camley Street Natural Park References Category:Parks and open spaces in the London Borough of Camden Category:Local nature reserves in Greater London Category:Nature reserves in the London Borough of Camden Category:London Wildlife Trust Category:Kings Cross, London ","title":"Camley Street Natural Park"},{"id":"3907680","text":"Sinfonia da Requiem, Op. 20, for orchestra is a symphony written by Benjamin Britten in 1940 at the age of 26. It was one of several works commissioned from different composers by the Japanese government to mark Emperor Jimmu's 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire (taken to be 11 February 660 BCE from birth of Emperor Jimmu). The Japanese government rejected the Sinfonia for its use of Latin titles from the Catholic Requiem for its three movements and for its somber overall character, but it was received positively at its world premiere in New York under John Barbirolli. A performance in Boston under Serge Koussevitzky led to the commission of the opera Peter Grimes from the Koussevitzky Music Foundations. The Sinfonia is Britten's largest purely orchestral work for the concert hall. It was his first major orchestral work that did not include a soloist and, according to musicologist Peter Evans, marks the peak of his early writing in this idiom. Unlike many of Britten's works from this time, it has remained popular and continues to be programmed on orchestral concerts. History In the early autumn of 1939, Britten was approached through the British Council to write an orchestral work for a special festivity of an unspecified great power. Britten agreed in principle to this request, provided that he would not be expected to furnish a piece that was in any way jingoistic. Britten subsequently learned that the requester was Japan, whose government had requested works by composers from several countries to celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the ruling dynasty. At this point, Japan was engaged fully in its invasion of mainland China but had not yet entered World War II formally or become allied with Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy. It had also developed a firm acquaintance with Western classical music. Performing groups trained by Western musicians were numerous. Other Western composers who received commissions included Richard Strauss, who was directed to participate by Joseph Goebbels of the Nazi German government, and French composer Jacques Ibert. Along with the Western composers invited, several Japanese composers participated in the anniversary celebrations. Six months passed before the contract to write this work arrived. By this time, Britten had begun work on the Sinfonia. The delay in receiving the contract left him with only six weeks in which to fulfil the commission. The only work which Britten felt able to complete in time was the Sinfonia. In Britten on Music, the composer wrote that he then approached the local Japanese consul, discussed the work's nature and its suitability for the occasion for which it was intended, and told the consul of the Latin titles for the work's three movements. Britten assumed that all the information he disclosed had been forwarded to the Japanese ambassador. He wrote that he was subsequently notified that the Sinfonia would fulfill the commission satisfactorily. Britten completed the work, submitted it, and for six months heard nothing more about the matter. In the autumn of 1940, Britten was summoned to the Japanese consulate, where he was read a long letter from Viscount Hidemaro Konoye, who served as organizer of the celebration. The Viscount was the younger brother of Prince Fumimaro Konoye, the then prime minister of Japan. In this letter, the Viscount accused Britten, as Britten later wrote, \\"of insulting a friendly power, of providing a Christian work where Christianity was apparently unacceptable, that the work was gloomy, and so on\\". This section of the letter read, \\"We are afraid that the composer must have greatly misunderstood our desire ... [The music] has a melancholy tone both in its melodic pattern and rhythm, making it unsuitable for performance on such an occasion as our national ceremony.\\" With the help of poet and fellow expatriate W.H. Auden, Britten replied in writing, \\"in as dignified a manner as possible\\", that his supplying a Christian work was no surprise, as he was a Christian and came from a Christian nation. He denied the alleged glumness of the Sinfonia and any intent of an insult, and said that the delay in receiving the contract had eliminated the possibility of composing a celebratory work within the deadline. Britten submitted this letter to the British consulate, which approved it and forwarded it to Tokyo. This was the last, he wrote, that he heard of the matter. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, relations between Britain and Japan were severed. Although the piece was rejected, the Japanese did not request the return of the commissioning fee. Instead, Viscount Konoye announced that Britten's score had arrived too late for inclusion in the celebration. Premiere and subsequent commission The world premiere took place in Carnegie Hall, New York on 29 March 1941 with the New York Philharmonic under John Barbirolli. The first British performance took place the following year, and its belated Japanese premiere was on 18 February 1956, with the composer conducting the NHK Symphony Orchestra.Pears, Peter; Reed, Philip, ed.; Thorpe, Marion, contributing. (1999) . Boydell & Brewer. page 64. . Not long after the New York premiere, Serge Koussevitzky conducted the work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. This performance led to the Koussevitzky Music Foundations commission of Britten's opera Peter Grimes. Composition =Structure= The symphony is in three movements played without a break, and a performance usually lasts around 20 minutes. Britten's analysis, quoted in the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra's program notes, reads: The headings of the three movements are taken from the Roman Catholic Mass for the dead, but the composition has no liturgical associations. Britten described the movements respectively as \\"a slow, marching lament\\", \\"a form of Dance of Death\\" and \\"the final resolution\\". All its movements have D as their tonal center. =Themes= I.

It was also an expression of the composer's lifelong pacifism and a reaction to the darkening political developments that led eventually to the Second World War. He had, in fact, recently settled in the United States because of Britain's involvement in the war. In an article published on 27 April 1940, he told the New York Sun, \\"I'm making it just as anti-war as possible ... I don't believe you can express social or political or economic theories in music, but by coupling new music with well-known musical phrases, I think it's possible to get over certain ideas ... all I'm sure of is my own anti-war conviction as I write it.\\" Britten's politically themed works before 1939 had not proved popular. While his publisher, Boosey & Hawkes, had supported him in his composition, it had also tried to encourage him to write more conventional pieces, suggesting, for example, a piano concerto for the BBC and a ballet for Sadler's Wells. The war changed all this. Before the Sinfonia, the Ballad of Heroes and Advance Democracy did well because of their political themes. =Place in Britten's canon= Musicologist Peter Evans claims that, while Diversions for Piano Left Hand and Orchestra came afterwards, the Sinfonia represents the peak of Britten's early orchestral writing.

History The monks of Birkenhead Priory had been granted a charter establishing ferry rights to Liverpool, which was confirmed by Edward III in about 1330. These rights reverted to the Crown in 1536, upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. There followed a period of private ownership by local landowners of the numerous ferry services on the Wirral bank of the River Mersey, including at Woodside. By the 18th century, an increase in stage coach traffic from Chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river. With the rapid development of Birkenhead from the 1820s, facilities at Woodside would eventually need expanding. By 1842, the ferry service had been taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners. A stone pier with two slipways and a small lighthouse at the pier head were constructed. There followed another period of major rebuilding, which included land reclamation up to the end of the pier. Construction of a floating landing stage in 1861 allowed for combined usage by the ferries and the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Improvements were made to the ferry's fleet at Woodside in 1890, with the replacement of paddle steamers for twin screw steamers. A dedicated luggage boat service, which ferried goods and vehicles across the river, had begun by 1879. The opening of the Birkenhead to Liverpool Queensway road tunnel on 18 July 1934 hastened the demise of Woodside's luggage boats, the service ending on 21 July 1941. On 29 August 1860, Britain's first street tramway was established, running from Woodside to Birkenhead Park. The idea of flamboyant American George Francis Train, the tramway was initially horse drawn. Electrified in 1901, tram services were discontinued in Birkenhead on 17 July 1937. A preserved Edwardian era tram is on display in the Woodside Ferry booking hall. Originally built by the Great Western Railway in the 1870s, Birkenhead Woodside railway station was a mainline terminus, with services direct to London Paddington. The station closed on 5 November 1967 and was demolished within a couple of years. =Woodside Hotel= Built in about 1834 to replace an earlier establishment of the same name, the hotel was a busy coaching house and originally had stabling for 100 horses. Until the land reclamation works of the mid 19th century, the hotel was situated on the riverbank. The hotel was extended in 1963 with a new lounge 'Gough's Landing', named after a 19th-century licensee. The historic building was extensively damaged in two fires on 4 June and 13 August 2008, having been unoccupied for some time. Deemed structurally unsafe, the remains of Woodside Hotel were demolished without planning permission in October 2008. Geography Woodside is situated on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, adjoining the River Mersey to the east. Woodside is about south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Thurstaston. The area is at an elevation of between above sea level. Landmarks Woodside Ferry Terminal booking hall in 2006. =Mersey Ferries Booking Hall= A wooden construction on brick foundations, the 1864 booking hall is a listed building. It remained virtually unaltered until it was extensively refurbished from 1985 in the existing style, with many of the original timbers being replaced. The formerly adjoining terminal building behind, of a similar construction, was demolished and replaced, due to poor condition. The passenger bridge and landing stage, which featured in the 1981 film Chariots of Fire, were also replaced at the same time. The building houses a cafeteria and a bookings office for the Mersey Ferries. =Shore Road Pumping Station= Located opposite the site of the former Woodside Hotel, the Shore Road Pumping Station is now part of Wirral Museum. Built in the 1870s, the 'Giant Grasshopper' engine is a working example of a large steam pump, which was used to clear water from the Mersey Railway Tunnel. =Memorial garden= A small garden area stands on the north side of the site, between the Bus terminal and the buildings off Shore Road. In the gardens is a stone plinth and a plaque commemorating Norman Tunna, Birkenhead resident and George Cross recipient.George Cross database; retrieved 6 September 2016 =Resurgam= A replica of the Birkenhead built, pioneering submarine Resurgam, was put on display in 1997 at Woodside. It is positioned near to the ferry terminal, on part of the site of the former floating roadway that once connected to the ferry landing stage. =U-534= On 27 June 2007, the Merseytravel transit authority announced that it had acquired the to display at the Woodside Ferry Terminal. The submarine was sunk by British bombers in May 1945; it was salvaged in 1993 off the Danish island of Anholt. The submarine was part of the collection of the Warship Preservation Trust at Birkenhead Docks, which closed on 5 February 2006. For technical reasons and to facilitate economical transportation to its new site, the vessel was cut into four sections. It will be displayed in this form to allow visitors better access and visibility. Beginning on 10 March 2008, the sections were transported by floating crane over a number of days. The exhibition opened on 10 February 2009. Transport Woodside is one of two Wirral terminals for the Mersey Ferry to the Pier Head in Liverpool. This terminal underwent a programme of extensive refurbishment in 1985. When reopened on 13 March 1986, the restoration of the historic booking hall had been completed and the large, dilapidated Victorian landing stage replaced with the current facility. Woodside bus station Woodside Bus Station is away from the Woodside Ferry Terminal and was constructed as an interchange for passengers travelling to/from Liverpool via the Mersey Ferry. The importance of Woodside as a major transport hub has declined. Woodside railway station closed in 1967, improvements to the Merseyrail network following the construction of the Liverpool Loop a decade later, the opening of the more centrally located Birkenhead bus station in the late 1990s and the diversion of several bus services to terminate in Liverpool instead, were all contributing factors. However, some local bus services still use the terminus and seasonal tram services are occasionally run between the site and nearby Wirral Transport Museum. The nearest railway station to Woodside is Hamilton Square station on Merseyrail's Wirral Line. Services run to Liverpool, Chester, Ellesmere Port, New Brighton and West Kirby.

Maras dig a burrow to sleep in at night. Food and diet The Chacoan mara eat grasses and other herbage. They will eat nearly any available vegetation. Social structure Chacoan maras live in small groups of up to four animals.

Such movements aim to provide the advantages of quartz without the inconvenience and environmental impact of batteries. Several manufacturers employ this technique. Mode of operation A rotating pendulum inside the case is attached to a relatively large gear which meshes with a very small pinion. As the wearer moves, the pendulum turns and spins the pinion at a very high speed - up to 100,000 rpm. This is coupled to a miniature electrical generator which charges a storage device which is a capacitor(s) or a rechargeable battery. A typical full charge will last between two weeks and six months. Applications =Seiko= Japanese company Seiko pioneered the technique which it unveiled at the Baselworld 1986 trade show under the trial name AGM. The first such watch was released in Germany in January 1988 and April of the same year in Japan (under the name Auto-Quartz). The watches had an average monthly rate of ¬±15 sec and provided 75 hours of continuous operation when fully powered. Early automatic quartz movements were called AGS (Automatic Generating System). In 1991 the company introduced the Kinetic brand name.Adv. Today Seiko offers a wide range of watches with various Kinetic movements. The top of the line is the caliber 9T82, included in Sportura (international brand) and PROSPEX (only marketed in Japan) Collection. It is sold in limited volume at a price range of about US$3000 which makes it one of the most expensive automatic quartz watches. Kinetic technology has also been used in some of Seiko's Pulsar and Lorus watches. As of 2007, Seiko has sold more than eight million automatic quartz watches. The different calibres of Kinetic watches currently are relatively large and heavy, weighing in at 1/3 of a pound (150 grams) or more on many models. Therefore, most Seiko Kinetic watches are only available in a men's size.

This watch uses Omega caliber 1400 (ETA 205.111 Rhodium plated). Swiss company ETA SA, part of the Swatch group, made seven different automatic quartz movements, calling them Autoquartz. They were part of the premium Flatline series of movements and were sold to a variety of watch vendors, primarily European and American. High grade movements designed to last as long as their premium mechanical movements, they had between 15 and 53 jewels. Unlike most quartz watches, Autoquartz could be calibrated to increase their accuracy. Several vendors had their Autoquartz watches COSC certified. In 2006 to increase production of its highly demanded mechanical movements, Swatch discontinued supplying the Autoquartz line to customers (service and parts are still available). Then in 2009, possibly due to available production capacity or stocked parts, Tissot reintroduced the Autoquartz in its PRC200 dive watch. The Autoquartz movement used by Tissot is gold plated and carries the designation ETA 205.914. Movement calibers: * 204.901 (small 8.75 lignes used primarily in women's watches) * 204.911 (replacement for the 204.901 upgrading from a capacitor to a rechargeable battery) * 205.111 (discontinued and replaced by the 205.911 which upgraded from a capacitor to a rechargeable battery) * 205.711 (15 jeweled movement used only by Swatch Watch for a variety of its fashion watches) * 205.911 (the most commonly available movement having 17 jewels and often ordered in gold plating) * 205.914 (no information available from ETA) * 205.961 (a 205.911 with the addition of a GMT hand) * 206.211 (a 205.911 fitted with a Dubois Depraz 2021 to make a chronograph.

Novel to this watch was the use of both mechanical power as well as a solar cell. This model was an attempt to enter higher-priced markets (at a cost of around $1000 USD), but the technology failed to attract consumer interest and Citizen has since stopped making use of the unique movement. No other autoquartz powered watch from Citizen is known; all other Eco-Drive models only use solar power or thermal power. =Ventura= Ventura is a small Swiss watch manufacturer claiming to be \\"the World's only manufacturer of automatic digital watches\\". Their VEN_99 movement was the only watch to ever combine autoquartz and digital readout of time (LCD) in one package. Offered were three models: the Sparc rx, fx and px. In late 2006, the company started selling their movement with an incorporated alarm, another exclusive feature. All hardware is proprietary to Ventura. In 2007 the company went into bankruptcy.Chuck Maddox‚Äôs Watch Blog: Sad news to report, the loss of an innovator... Support was available from an independent entity. In 2011 the company re-emerged from bankruptcy and continued to sell its models, introducing the \\"2nd gen Micro-Generating-System\\" and marketing the watch (Sparc MGS) integrating it as the world's first and only digital-readout multi-function automatic quartz module. Unlike with other manufacturers the watch movement (VEN_10) and power source (MGS) are separate units, only linked by a single wire. Pricing In spite of the relatively complex mechanical parts used, Seiko has positioned their kinetic watches to be medium-priced.\\"We have strengthened the Seiko collection in the medium price range\\" Exceptions are kinetic with other complications such as chronograph movement 9T82, 7L22 and direct drive movements. ETA sold Autoquartz to a variety of Swiss manufacturers with pricing below $100 (Swatch) to multiple thousands (Omega, Baume et Mercier, et al.). Ventura prices its automatic quartz watches at around 2000-4000 Euro.

It is also known as the Patagonian cavy, Patagonian hare, or dillaby. This herbivorous, somewhat rabbit-like animal is found in open and semiopen habitats in Argentina, including large parts of Patagonia. It is monogamous, but often breeds in warrens shared by several pairs. Description The Patagonian mara resembles a jackrabbit. It has distinctive long ears and long limbs. Its hind limbs are longer and more muscular than its fore limbs and it has a longer radius than humerus.Campos. C. M., Tognelli. M. F., Ojeda. R. A., (2001) Dolichotis patagonu, Mammalian Species, 625:1-5 The feet are compressed, making them hoof-like. The fore feet have four digits while the hind feet have three digits. Its tail is short, depressed, and hairless. It has a gray dorsal pelage with a white patch on the rump separated from the dorsal fur by a black area.Redford, K. H., and J. F. Eisenberg, (1992) Mammals of the Neotropics: The Southern Cone, University of Chicago Press. In addition, the mara has a white underside with a somewhat orange flank and chin. The average Patagonian mara has a head and body length of with a tail of . It weighs . Unlike most other cavids, such as guinea pigs and capybaras, the anal glands of the mara are between the anus and the base of the tail rather than being anterior to the anus. Ecology and activity Mara foraging Patagonian maras are found only in Argentina, from 28 to 50¬∞S. They prefer to live in habitats with shrub cover, but they also inhabit overgrazed and barren soils in the Monte Desert biome. In northwestern Argentina, they primarily inhabit lowland habitats such as forest and creosote bush or larrea. Maras prefer sandy and low shrub habitat in Valdes Peninsula. They have adapted well to a cursorial lifestyle on the open plains and steppe, with long legs, reduced clavicle, and well-developed sensory organs making them capable of running and communicating in these open habitats. When running, maras have been compared to deer and antelope.Smythe. N., (1970) \\"On the existence of pursuit invitation signals in mammals\\". American Naturalist 104(938): 491-94. Maras are largely herbivorous. They feed primarily on green vegetation and fruit. In the Monte Desert, monocots make up 70% of their diet, while dicots make up 30%.Claudia M. Campos and Ricardo A. Ojeda, (1997) \\"Dispersal and germination of Prosopis flexuosa (Fabaceae) seeds by desert mammals in Argentina\\", Journal of Arid Environments, 35(4):707-14. Preferred grass species eaten are those of the genera Chloris, Pappophorum, and Trichloris, while dicots that are eaten include Atriplex lampa, Lycium spp., and Prosopis spp. Maras are primarily diurnal and around 46% of their daily activities involve feeding.TABER AB (1987) \\"The Behavioural Ecology of the Mara\\". Dolichotis patagonum. Ph. D. Thesis, Belliol College, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom. Their temporal activity rhythms are related to environmental factors.Kufner. M. B. (1995) \\"Temporal activity of the mara (Dolichotis patagonum) in the Monte Desert, Argentina\\". Studies on Neotropical Fauna and Environment 30:37‚Äì43. Light, precipitation, and temperate have positive effects on annual activities, while darkness and relative humidity have negative effects. The daily activity of maras is unimodal in winter and biomodal in other seasons. Their preferred temperature is around C. Females spend more time feeding than the males, due to the demands of gestation and lactation. Males spend most of the day sitting, being vigilant for predators. Predators of maras, particularly the young, are felids, grisons, foxes, and birds of prey. Maras are also hosts for parasites such as the nematode worm Wellcomia dolichotis. Social behavior and reproduction Mara pair with young Their social organizations have a unique combination of monogamy and communal breeding.Taber, A. B. and Macdonald, D. W. (1992), \\"Communal breeding in the mara, Dolichotis patagonum \\". Journal of Zoology, 227: 439‚Äì452. Being monogamous, pairs of maras stay together for life, with replacement of partners only occurring after one's death.Genest, H. & Dubost, G. (1974) \\"Pair living in the mara ( Dolichotis paragonum Z ) \\" Mammalia 38: 155-162. The male has almost the sole responsibility in maintaining the pair by following the female wherever she goes. A male marks his female with urine and marks the ground around her with secretions from his glands and with feces, making the grounds around the female a mobile territory. Pairs breed together alone or with other pairs in warrens shared by up to 29 pairs. Maras breed, at least in southern Argentina, from August to January. Gestation lasts 100 days in wild. Most births in Patagonia occur between September and October, which is before the summer dry season and after the winter rains. Females produce one litter each year in the wild, but can produce as many as four litters a year in captivity. Young can walk almost immediately postpartum. Young mara and older one sniffing each other, from the zoological garden of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris Mara at Barbados Wildlife Reserve, Barbados Dens are dug during the breeding season for the young to be raised. Litters from one to 22 pairs are grouped together in these dens. Communal living provides protection from predators with the survival rate for young being higher in larger groups than in smaller groups. One pair visits the den at a time for around one hour and the other parents circle around the den.U. GANSLOSSER, S. WEHNELT (1997) \\"Juvenile development as part of the extraordinary social system of the Mara Dolichotis patagonum (Rodentia: Caviidae) \\", Mammalia 61:3-15. One or two pups are nursed at a time by a female. A female may sometimes nurse a young from another pair. While a female may prevent young other than her own from nursing her, some young are able to steal milk. Mothers do not actively cooperate in raising their young. For the first three weeks, young remain near the den. At this time, distance between individuals is low, with frequent body contact, huddling, allogrooming, and extended play among the pups. After this, the young are able to leave the den and graze with their parents. Young are weaned after 13 weeks. Maras make a number of vocalizations during grazing or slow locomotion. When seeking contact, a mara emits an inflected \\"wheet\\" while a low, repetitive grunt is made when following a conspecific. Maras tooth chatter and emit low grunts when threatened. They also produce a series of short grunts when grooming.Eisenberg, J. F. (1974). \\"The function and motivational basis of hystricomorph vocalizations\\". Symp. Zool. Soc. London 34, 211-248. Scent marking is used by maras for complex and intense social interactions. Maras stretch and sniff the soil and then sit upright with an arched back and the anogenital area flattened to the ground, a process known as anal digging. In addition, a male stands on his hind legs and urinates on a female's rump, to which the female responds by spraying a jet of urine backwards into the face of the male. The male's urination is meant to repel other males from his partner, while the female's urination is a rejection of any approaching male when she is not receptive.

He founded the famous Chicano collective Los Four that consisted of artists Carlos Almaraz, Beto de la Rocha (Father of former Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha), Frank Romero and himself. In 1974, Judithe Hern√°ndez became the \\"fifth\\" and only female member of Los Four. Luj√°n was born in French Camp, California, near Stockton, to parents of Mexican and indigenous ancestry from West Texas. Six months later, his family relocated to East Los Angeles, California, where he spent his childhood and adolescence, except for some time in Guadalajara in 1944 or 1945. As a young teenager, Luj√°n was heavily influenced by the Afro-American music scene in Los Angeles, for instance listening to Johnny Ace and Mary Wells. He went to El Monte High School, class of 1958. After serving in the Air Force, Luj√°n returned home from three years in England in 1962 and began to attend college, first at East Los Angeles College, then to California State University, Long Beach, where he earned his B.A. in Ceramic Sculpture in 1969 and then to University of California, Irvine, where he earned an M.F.A. in Sculpture in 1973. By this time East L.A. had become a hotbed of socio-political and cultural activity, as the Chicano Movement became a turbulent and exciting social force in the communities the U.S. Southwest. At this time Luj√°n began to organize art exhibits and artists' conferences to establish Chicano Art as a valid form of artistic expression. The first of these was held at Camp Hess-Kramer, which was, according to Luj√°n, \\"a Jewish camp that allowed Mexican-Americans to meet there to talk about educational disparities that we had in East L.A.\\" In 1969, Luj√°n curated a Chicano art show at Cal State Long Beach, and during the show's run, met with various artists associated with East LA art journal Con Safos. Luj√°n was invited to become art director of Con Safos, and through this work, he met with three other like-minded Chicano artists and formed Los Four in the Fall of 1973 at the University of California, Irvine. In 1973, Los Four had their premiere exhibition at UC Irvine. In 1974, Los Four exhibited the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's first-ever Chicano Art show, appropriately called \\"Los Four.\\" This was quickly followed by several other exhibitions on the west coast. Los Four did for Chicano visual art what ASCO had done for Chicano performance art; that is, it helped establish the themes, esthetic and vocabulary of the nascent movement. \\"Magu\\", the name by which Luj√°n is most known says of that time: :The significance of Los Four mirrored the socio- political introspection and concerns of Raza at that time besides providing some iconographic vocabulary to initiate definitions of our ethno-art forms. Our Los Four Xicano contingency ran against some Euro-aesthetic standards of the period. We, as pictorial artists, gave a visual voice to those interests of parity for our young artist constituency-culture. It was a form of cooperation binding us by our sociological circumstance, indigenous paradigms and our adopted response to unify ourselves along political cultural oriented purposes, in lieu of solely aesthetical ones. From 1976-1980, Luj√°n taught at the La Raza Studies Department at Fresno City College becoming department chair 1980. Since then, Luj√°n has worked full-time on his artwork, devoted to developing his aesthetic. During the years of 1999-2007, Magu held his art studio operations at the Pomona Art Colony in downtown Pomona, CA, helping to garner appreciation and support of the arts in the city and surrounding communities. During 2005, he took on a position as art professor at Pomona College, one of the seven prestigious Claremont Colleges. In 1990 Magu was commissioned as a design principal for the Hollywood & Vine station on the Metro Rail Red Line (Hollywood/Vine (LACMTA station)) in Los Angeles, California . By 1999 Magu completed a series of wall tiles and platform sculptural benches in the form of lowrider automobiles. He chose the theme song, \\"Hooray for Hollywood\\", as the signature tune for the Hollywood & Vine Metro station. A design rudder established was 'light,' which Lujan considered another central motif in Hollywood, from the light that passed through film projectors to the sunny streets of Southern California to the creation of celebrity \\"Stars.\\" The Yellow Brick Road, which was built to run from the plaza (which is currently being demolished to build a high-rise with chain restaurants and businesses) to the train platform, is a prominent motif taken from the 1939 classic movie ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz,‚Äú a movie which was an inspiration to Luj√°n's work. Magu's artwork became famous in its own right throughout the 1980s and 1990s as it used colorful imagery, anthropomorphic animals, depictions of outrageously proportioned lowrider cars, festooned with indigenous/urban motifs juxtaposed, graffiti, Dia De Los Muertos installation altars and all sorts of borrowings from pop-culture. Magu states: :\\"My art intentions, over the years, have been to use Mesoamerican heritage as well as implementing current popular Art and cultural folk sources as the content substance to make Chicanarte.\\" One of his sons is the accordionist Oto√±o Luj√°n, who is a member of the band Conjunto Los Pochos.

Equine influenza occurs globally, previously caused by two main strains of virus: equine-1 (H7N7) and equine-2 (H3N8). The OIE now considers H7N7 strains likely to be extinct since these strains have not been isolated for over 20 years. Predominant international circulating H3N8 strains are Florida sublineage of the American lineage; clade 1 predominates in the Americas and clade 2 in Europe. (Elton and Cullinane, 2013;Equine influenza: Antigenic drift and implications for vaccines D. Elton, A. Cullinane 14 October 2013, BEVA, Equine Veterinary Journal, onlinelibrary.wiley.com, accessed 12 February 2019 Paillot, 2014; Slater et al., 2013Report of the International Equine Influenza Roundtable Expert Meeting at Le Touquet, Normandy, February 2013 (J. Slater, K. Borchers, T. Chambers, A. Cullinane, V. Duggan, D. Elton, L. Legrand, R. Paillot, G. Fortier) 21 August 2014 BEVA, Equine Veterinary Journal, onlinelibrary.wiley.com, accessed 12 February 2019). The disease has a nearly 100% infection rate in an unvaccinated horse population with no prior exposure to the virus. While equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans, impacts of past outbreaks have been devastating due to the economic reliance on horses for communication (postal service), military (cavalry), and general transportation. In modern times, though, the ramifications of equine influenza are most clear in the horse-racing industry. Clinical Signs  Equine influenza is characterized by a very high rate of transmission among horses, and has a relatively short incubation time of one to three days. Clinical signs of equine influenza include fever (up to ), nasal discharge, have a dry, hacking cough, depression, loss of appetite and weakness. Secondary infections may include pneumonia. Horses that are mildly affected will recover within 2 to 3 weeks; however, it may take up to 6 months for recovery for severely affected horses. Horses that become immune may not show signs but will still shed the virus. An 1872 report on equine influenza describes the disease as: Causes Equine influenza is caused by several strains of the influenza A virus endemic to horses. Viruses that cause equine influenza were first isolated in 1956. The equine-1 virus affects heart muscle, while the equine-2 virus is much more severe and systemic. The virus is spread by infected, coughing horses in addition to contaminated buckets, brushes, tack and other stable equipment. The influenza virus causes symptoms by replicating within respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in destruction of tracheal and bronchial epithelium and cilia.  Treatment  When a horse contracts the equine influenza virus, rest and supportive care is advised so that complications do not occur. Veterinarians recommend at least one week of rest for every day that the fever persists with a minimum of three days' rest. This allows the damaged mucocilliary apparatus to regenerate. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are administered if the fever reaches greater than . If complications occur, such as the onset of pneumonia, or if the fever last more than 3 to 4 days, antibiotics are often administered.  Prevention  Prevention of equine influenza outbreaks is maintained through vaccines and hygiene procedures. Isolation of horses for two weeks is common practice when they are being moved to a new environment. =Vaccines= Vaccines (ATCvet codes: inactivated, live, plus various combinations) are a major defense against the disease. Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of vaccines, followed by booster shots. It is recommended that horses be vaccinated against equine influenza annually, and competition horses that travel frequently be given a booster every six months as they are at higher risk of contracting the virus. Foals are initially vaccinated at six months of age with a booster 3 to 6 weeks later and again between 10 and 12 months. Standard schedules may not maintain absolutely foolproof levels of protection, and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations.equiflunet_vaccines Equine influenza virus (EIV) undergoes continuous antigenic drift, and vaccine protection from immunogenic stimulation is maximised when vaccines strains have greater homogeneity to circulating strains. Subclinically affected vaccinated horses can shed live virus and represent a threat to unvaccinated or inappropriately vaccinated horses. Neutralising immunity leading to an absence of infection is rare. (Paillot, 2014) An OIE expert surveillance panel annually assesses circulating strains and makes relevant vaccine recommendations. The UK requires horses participating in show events be vaccinated against equine flu, and a vaccination card must be produced; the International Federation for Equestrian Sports requires vaccination every six months.  History  A comprehensive report describing the disease‚Äîcompiled in response to the 1872 outbreak of the disease in North America‚Äîprovided a thorough examination of the history of the disease. =Early records= The report notes putative cases dating as far back as Hippocrates and Livius. Absyrtus, a Greek veterinarian from 330 CE, described a disease in the horse population having the general characters of influenza, which the report mentions as the earliest clear record of equine influenza in the lower animals. The report notes the next recorded equine influenza case in 1299, the same year that a catarrhal epidemic affected Europe. Spanish records noted cases in which \\"The horse carried his head drooping, would eat nothing, ran from the eyes, and there was hurried beating of the flanks. The malady was epidemic, and in that year one thousand horses died.\\" Prevalence of influenza is found in historic records in the centuries of the Middle Ages, but direct implication of horses is not always clear. Neither are recorded instances of record deaths among horses and other animals clear on the exact cause of death. =1872 North American outbreak= Spread of epizootic An epizootic outbreak of equine influenza during 1872 in North America became known as \\"The Great Epizootic of 1872\\". The outbreak is known as the \\"most destructive recorded episode of equine influenza in history\\". In 1870, three fourths of Americans lived in rural areas (towns under 2,500 population, and farms). Horse and mule power was used for moving wagons and carriages, and pulling plows and farm equipment. The census of 1870 counted 7.1 million horses and 1.1 million mules, as well as 39 million humans.see \\"Changes in the Horse Industry\\" ker.com, Kentucky Equine Research, 20 October 2007, accessed 17 March 2019 With most urban horses and mules incapacitated for a week or two, humans used wheelbarrows and pulled the wagons. About 1% of the animals died, and the rest fully recovered.James P. McClure, \\"The epizootic of 1872: Horses and disease in a nation in motion.\\" New York History (1998) 79#1 pp: 4-22. The first cases of the disease were reported from Ontario, Canada. By October 1, 1872, the first case occurred in Toronto. All the streetcar horses and major livery stables were affected within only three days. By the middle of October, the disease had reached Montreal, Detroit, and New England. On October 25, 1872, The New York Times reported on the extent of the outbreak, claiming that nearly all public stables in the city had been affected, and that the majority of the horses owned in the private sector had essentially been rendered useless to their owners.\\"The Horse Plague: Fifteen Thousand Horses in this City Unfit for Use.\\" The New York Times [New York] 25 Oct. 1872: Only days later, the Times went on to report that 95% of all horses in Rochester, New York, had been affected, while the disease was also making its way quickly through the state of Maine and had already affected all fire horses in the city of Providence, Rhode Island.‚ÄúThe Horse Distemper: Further Increase of the Epidemic in this City‚Äù The New York Times 26 Oct. 1872: On October 30, 1872, The New York Times reported that a complete suspension of travel had been noted in the state.

History This Scottish football league was one of a number of supplementary football leagues that operated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It was developed and produced in association with the Australian Film Commission; developed and produced with the assistance of Film Victoria and produced in association with SBS Independent. It was supposed to be succeeded by three other feature films : Jasper Morello and the return of Claude Belgon, Jasper Morello and the Ghost of ALTO MEA and Jasper Morello and the Ebeneza of Gothia.  Story  The film opens in the city of Gothia, a smoky industrial metropolis where steam-powered dirigibles are the primary mode of transportation, and where a terrible flesh-eating plague is decimating the population. The protagonist, royal navigator Jasper Morello (Joel Edgerton), is deployed by the government to distribute mobile weather beacons along the route of his next voyage. He has difficulty concentrating on the task, guilt-stricken over the recent death of one of his crew members which was caused by a mistake in his calculations (\\"one degree can be a very large distance - enough to unmake a man\\"). He fears for the safety of his wife, alone at home amidst the plague. Their airship the Resolution is also carrying a passenger, the eccentric Dr Claude Belgon (Helmut Bakaitis), a \\"controversial biologist\\" searching for a cure for the plague, and motivated by a thirst for fame. Soon after taking off, the Resolution is caught up in a storm and wrecked in a collision with an abandoned vessel; Jasper loses his compass. The crew then prepares to continue on their way in the new ship. Learning that his wife Amelia, whom he left at home, has contracted the plague, Jasper despairs and tries to turn the ship around; he is sedated by Claude. As the voyage continues, one crew member contracts the plague. The captain decides to turn around and head home, but is forestalled by the sighting of an uninhabited levitating island. While exploring there, Jasper is attacked by a large bug-like creature, which they manage to kill, despite the protests of Claude, who had wanted to capture a living specimen. Upon eating the remains of the monster, the crew notices that the boiled blood of the creature cures their sick mate. Claude insists on bringing back some cocoons of the creature to Gothia, in order to establish a breeding colony to cure the citizens. The cocoons are brought aboard the ship. One by one they hatch, but die before Claude can determine a suitable mode of nourishment. At length he realises that they require human blood, and he feeds the single remaining creature with his own blood. Two of the crew go missing, rousing Jasper‚Äôs suspicions, but Claude sedates him again when he discovers that the doctor has been feeding the monster with them. When Jasper revives, he is chained to the wheel and Claude tells him that the whole crew is under sedation, waiting to be fed to the creature. Jasper, without a choice, guides the ship towards home. He deliberately rams the ship into an iceberg, killing Claude. The film ends with Jasper, left alone, attaching a blood-sucking machine to his arm to feed the last creature. Knowing that he may not survive, prior to reaching home, Jasper reassures his wife that he will be, with \\"The great company of souls, riding the borealis to eternity\\" (a reference to his previous observation, of such a sight). \\"Perhaps,\\" he muses, \\"they will require a navigator\\".Anthony Lucas (2005).

KP, RTS, q-23P.g.k.o. * Amelia Morello - Jasper's wife, a nurse in Gothia among the Plague victims  Animation style  The short film is set in a world styled after mid-Victorian England with steampunk style iron dirigibles and steam powered computers, where giant mechanical airships are the main mode of transport. The characters are animated in the style of Wayang (Indonesian shadow puppets), best described as silhouettes. The visual style of the characters is similarly compared to that used by the 1926 film The Adventures of Prince Achmed (one of the oldest-surviving animated feature films). The animation production style was essentially \\"\\", using anything that served the purpose. Scenes featuring characters were composed out of a variety of materials, including card cut- outs which were then scanned and manipulated in Adobe Photoshop, and also various found objects. The backgrounds are actually 2D, consisting of many layers to simulate 3D. These background layers were later selectively blurred in the compositing application, to simulate distant views. Certain sequences (notably those featuring airships) are entirely computer-rendered 3D scenes using an assemblage of parts from a variety of commercial 3D models of vehicles and ships in the Despona 3DS Max series, textured and animated using 3DS Max. The final product consists of all of these elements brought together using the compositing program Combustion (software). Combustion added the particle effects for smoke and similar, while cloud layers in certain scenes were rendered using Maya.Curator's notes The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello (2005) on ASOAnthony Lucas on The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello-readersvoice.com  Awards  = Nominations = *Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, 2006.Short Film Winners: 2006 Oscars = Wins = * Australian Film Institute Awards, best short animation, outstanding achievement in craft in a non-feature, Production Design, * 2005 IF Awards.

It had been held annually in the late summer since 2004 at Robin Hill on the Isle of Wight. In 2017 the festival relocated to the Lulworth Estate in Dorset. The event was organised by DJ and record producer Rob da Bank along with his wife Josie and was an offshoot of his Sunday Best record label and club nights. The initial Bestival attracted 10,000 people, growing to 55,000 in 2010. Bestival won 'Best Major Festival' at the 2015 UK Festival Awards, having won 'Best Medium-Sized Festival' in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009, 'Best Major Festival' in 2010, 2012 and in 2015, 'Fan's Favourite' in 2011 and 'Best Innovation' in 2005. Origins The festival had been held annually in the late summer since 2004, in a small country park called 'Robin Hill' on The Isle of Wight. The event was organized by Rob da Bank and was an offshoot of his Sunday Best record label and club nights. Creative Director and wife Josie da Bank and co founders / partners John Hughes, Ziggy Gilsenan and Ben Turner were also involved in organising the event. The Isle of Wight holds more carnivals per capita than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.Isle of Wight Carnival 2006 In 2004, the festival was attended by 10,000 people, a figure which has since increased to 43,000 in 2009 and 55,000 in 2010. A family-friendly sister festival \\"Camp Bestival\\" launched in 2008. In December 2016, the organisers announced a move to The Lulworth Estate in Dorset. In 2018 Bestival moved from its usual September date to the first week in August, a week after its sister festival, Camp Bestival, took place on the same, Lulworth Estate site. In 2018 The Bestival organisation went into administration, leaving many workers unpaid. Bestival as a result ceased, however Camp Bestival continued on the same Lulworth Estate site and equivalent weekend in 2019. The event was again curated by Rob da Bank and his wife Josie. All remaining Bestival brands were bought out of administration in late 2018 by the US/Irish entertainments group Live Nation/Gaiety along with SJM concerts. As such they are now brand owners for Camp Bestival and, the currently inactive, Bestival. Festival ethos Bestival 2008 at Robin Hill Country Park Bestival was well known for its fancy dress themed days (usually the Saturday of the festival). In 2005, an attempt was made to set the Guinness World Record for most people in fancy dress at any one event. By 2010 this was achieved, when 55,000 festival goers set a new Guinness World Record. The festival was also heavily involved in supporting social and environmental causes. Rob da Bank and Bestival supported several Isle of Wight-based charities and youth organisations; for example Rob da Bank's Music Club, Isle of Wight Toy Appeal, Isle of Wight Youth Trust, St Catherines School and Barter For Bestival. On site at the festival, Bestival supported Oxfam, RSPB, Amnesty International, Water Aid and the Legacy Project. Bestival actively reduced its carbon emissions and impact on the environment; for example schemes such as Bike to Bestival, Swim to Bestival, LiftShare, exchanging recycling at the campsites for cups of tea, recycling and waste management, commissioning Environmental Impact Assessments, monitoring power usage and limiting water usage with push button taps. Bestival was a founding member of the Greener Festival Alliance. Bestival was often described as a \\"boutique festival\\" due to its non-corporate feel. It was also known for piloting odd and innovative ideas, including an inflatable church where people can get married. Other features included the \\"Breastival\\", a quiet Yurt designated for mothers and their breast-feeding children. The local Women's Institute had also been involved by providing refreshments for a minimal price.

Crimes After that Boyd failed to find adequate permanent employment and turned to crime to provide for his wife and three children. On September 9, 1949 Boyd robbed a North York branch of the Bank of Montreal.Kevin Plumer, Historicist: titillating and Terrorizing Toronto (Torontoist: September 2007). Retrieved Jan 20, 2010, at , 2 Between September 1949 and October 1951, Boyd pulled at least six bank heists.Kevin Plumer, Historicist: titillating and Terrorizing Toronto (Torontoist: September 2007). Retrieved Jan 20, 2010, at , 2 He joined up with another robber and carried out several other bold bank robberies. He had a reputation for jumping over counters, moving quickly, and carrying a gun. His partner, old Howard Gault, got caught and told all. They both went to the Don Jail in Toronto. While Boyd and his partner were robbing banks, another more violent gang was also doing the same thing. Lennie Jackson, a member of that gang, was caught at the same time as Boyd, and they soon began to swap notes. Soon another experienced bank robber, Willie Jackson (no relation to Lennie), alias The Clown, arrived at the Don Jail awaiting transfer to the Kingston Penitentiary for a seven-year sentence. Lennie Jackson had lost a foot in a railway accident and had a wooden foot in which he stored several hacksaw blades. The Boyd Gang \\"On November 4, 1951, Boyd and the Jacksons hacksawed the bars at the Kingston penitentiary went over the prison wall and escaped. They met a friend, Valent Lesso from Cochrane, one of the violent members of Lennie Jackson‚Äôs original gang, and the four became a team. Lesso was a talented musician who couldn‚Äôt find work; he changed his name to Steve Suchan and became a bank robber. They soon pulled off a series of robberies, including the biggest one in Toronto history. The newspapers dubbed the new group \\"the Boyd Gang,\\" seeing Boyd himself as the brains behind the operation. Willie Jackson was arrested and sent to the Don Jail. Boyd went into hiding with his wife Doreen.\\" Arrest and release The police received numerous calls from residents in West Ferris and Powassan, Ontario, and from a pharmacist in North Bay, but they did not pan out. After ten days, men were seen at a barn in the Don Valley and all members of the Boyd Gang, excluding Edwin Boyd himself, were captured without incident. With Boyd the only gang member left to be captured, Detective Adolphus 'Dolph' Payne kept Boyd's brother Norman under surveillance and discovered that he had rented a flat on Heath Street, but had not moved in yet. He secured a key to the back door from the owner and watched, from a neighbour's house, as Boyd moved into the flat. Wanting to avoid a shootout, he waited until he was sure everyone was asleep. At the crack of dawn on March 15, 1952, the police crept inside the house and captured Boyd and his wife while they were still in bed. Boyd's brother, who was sleeping in another room, was also apprehended. The Toronto Nugget reported the event by stating \\"Edwin Alonzo Boyd, Canada‚Äôs Public Enemy Number One, surrendered meekly with his henchmen to two suburban detectives, ending the greatest criminal man hunt in the Dominion‚Äôs history.\\" Steve Suchan and Lennie Jackson were executed for killing Detective Tong. Boyd received eight life sentences and Willie Jackson thirty years. Both were released on parole in 1962 after serving 10 years in Kingston Penitentiary for bank robbery. Boyd, under the name John, went to Victoria, British Columbia, where he drove a bus for disabled people and after divorcing Doreen married a disabled woman whom he met on the bus. He took care of her for the next 35 years, until they went into a retirement home. Death Two months prior to his death, Boyd told a CBC producer that he had once killed a couple and left their bodies in the trunk of a car in High Park, Toronto, years before his notoriety as a bank robber. The crime fits the September 11, 1947, murders of Iris Scott and George Vigus., The Fifth Estate, 21 September 2012 Before a formal investigation into his confession could commence, on May 17, 2002, after a visit from his wife and his son, and a phone call from his former war bride and the mother of his three children, Edwin Alonzo Boyd died at age 88. Legacy Two books have been written on the Boyd Gang, and one was made into a successful movie. Girls in the Gang, a musical written by Raymond Storey and Jon Roby, was based on the story of the Boyd gang. It debuted in 1987 at Toronto's Factory Theatre, produced by Dian English, and won a Dora Mavor Moore award for best musical. In 1998 Boyd was profiled in a documentary on CBC Television's Life and Times, wherein he admitted that he had committed many more robberies than he had been charged with. A fictionalized film on Boyd's life, Citizen Gangster, was released in 2011; Scott Speedman plays the part of Boyd. The episode \\"Scheherazade\\" of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit may have partially been based on Boyd's last days. In it, a former bank robber (Brian Dennehy) confesses to a murder shortly before dying.

At the nearby Hotel des Etrangers are two American criminals, confidence trickster Gordon \\"Oily\\" Carlisle and safe-blower \\"Soup\\" Slattery. Oily admits that he and his wife, \\"Gum-Shoe Gertie\\", had a falling-out a year prior. Soup tries to rob Mr Gedge, but Gedge has no money. They bond over their losses in the stock market crash. Gedge mentions that he was rich when he married and gave his wife sixty thousand dollars' worth of jewels, which are usually kept in a safe. Soup plans to rob the safe, with Oily acting as the inside man (which they call \\"working the inside stand\\"). American millionaire Patrick \\"Packy\\" Franklyn is engaged to the beautiful but austere Lady Beatrice Bracken. He sees his old friend, the fun-loving Vicomte de Blissac. Beatrice wants Packy to befriend the intellectual novelist Blair Eggleston. She is going to see her family in the country and is certain that Packy would get into trouble or \\"hot water\\" of some kind if left to himself. Packy goes to a barbershop, but the staff are on strike. For fun, Packy acts as barber for Senator Ambrose Opal, famous for supporting Dry legislation far stricter than the Volstead Act. Packy does a bad job and flees from the angered senator. This upsets Jane, since now her father will be especially unreceptive to the news that she is engaged to the impecunious Blair Eggleston. Packy apologizes to Jane, and encourages Blair to approach Senator Opal, who assumes Blair is his new valet. Jane wants Blair to keep up the act and win the senator's favour. Senator Opal accidentally sent a letter meant for his bootlegger to Mrs Gedge, and she threatens to publicize it unless he makes Mr Gedge ambassador. The senator agrees to consent to Jane marrying whomever she likes if she recovers the letter. Packy charters a yacht and follows them to St Rocque to help Jane. Soup, Packy, the Vicomte (in a parrot-like lizard costume), and Mr Gedge (dressed as an \\"Oriental potentate\\") enjoy St Rocque's annual fancy dress carnival, the Festival of the Saint. Packy helps Soup escape the police after a fight, and Soup offers to help him. Both the Vicomte and Mr Gedge get very drunk at the festival, and the next day, Packy, hoping to help Jane, lies to each man that he mortally injured the other in a brawl; each man agrees to avoid trouble by having Packy visit the Ch√¢teau pretending to be the Vicomte. Jane, disappointed in Blair for not helping her obtain the letter, is glad to see Packy. Senator Opal believes Packy is Jane's secret fianc√©, and approves since Packy is a millionaire and former Yale football star. While locating the safe in Mrs Gedge's room, Senator Opal is spotted by Mrs Gedge's lady's maid Medway. He suspects Medway is a detective, and orders Blair to find out. Oily has befriended Mrs Gedge under the alias of the Duc de Pont-Andemer. Playing their roles, Packy and Oily feign speaking French to each other in front of Mrs Gedge's secretary, Miss Putnam. Oily recognizes Medway, who is actually Gertie. Mrs Gedge returns and places her jewels and letter in her safe, but Soup refuses to rob the room while a woman is sleeping there. Packy claims he is a detective and gets Mrs Gedge to change rooms, though Miss Putnam, who is actually a detective hired by Mrs Gedge, knows Packy is lying. Blair, acting on Packy's advice, tells Medway he is a detective to see if she admits to being one, but this causes the thieves Medway and Oily (who have reconciled and plan to betray Soup) to tie him up and leave him in a boathouse for a while. Lady Beatrice appears, hears about Packy and Jane, and ends her engagement to Packy. Soup, who was forced by Senator Opal to sit on a window- sill for hours after being caught burgling, has misgivings about helping the senator but still decides to help Packy get the letter. The Vicomte and Mr Gedge see each other and happily get drunk again. Packy realises that he loves Jane but resolves to help her marry Blair anyway. Soup, Oily and Gertie, and Packy and Jane attempt to burgle the safe at about the same time. Gertie knocks out Soup and Oily manages to open the safe, but Kate Putnam shows up with a pistol. Oily and Gertie escape empty-handed. Packy eats the letter before Mrs Gedge can take it. Soup recognizes her as his old partner in crime, Julia. Packy uses this to blackmail Mrs Gedge into taking Mr Gedge back to Glendale, and finds Blair in the boathouse. Blair is finished with Jane's schemes and leaves her. Packy and Jane confess their feelings for each other. Soup, having made off with five pieces of jewellery from Mrs Gedge's safe, decides to retire and start a farm. Allusions to other novels The book features Gordon \\"Oily\\" Carlisle and his wife Gertie, who appear again in the book Cocktail Time (1958), and Blair Eggleston, who also appears in \\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\\" (1965). The fictional French resort town of St Rocque appears again in French Leave (1956). Publication history The novel was serialised in Collier's from 21 May to 6 August 1932, illustrated by Floyd M. Davis. The book is dedicated \\"To Maureen O'Sullivan, with love from Ethel, Leonora, Miss Winks, John-John, and The Author\\". Maureen O'Sullivan was a friend of the Wodehouse family. (Ethel and Leonora were Wodehouse's wife and step-daughter respectively, while Miss Winks and John-John were both female Pekingese dogs, the latter of which belonged to O'Sullivan but was looked after by the Wodehouses.) The first US edition included six illustrations by Rea Irvin. Adaptations The novel was adapted for the stage by Wodehouse and his long-time collaborator Guy Bolton as The Inside Stand. The play opened at the Saville Theatre in London on 21 November 1935 and ran for 50 performances. Produced by Jack Waller and directed by Geoffrey Norman, the play starred Ralph Lynn and Olive Blakeney.

In 2011, it was reported to have been found in seals. Cats have been experimentally infected with the virus, leading to clinical signs, shedding of the virus, and infection of other cats.  Introduction  Equine influenza (EI) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of horses and related animals such as donkeys, mules and zebras (collectively known as equines). Equine influenza is caused by a type A influenza virus in the family Orthomyxoviridae (genus Influenzavirus) Transmission of the equine influenza virus to humans has not occurred during outbreaks of the disease in horses. The present day lineages of equine influenza pose no threat to people.Farmnote on Equine Influenza by Karen Yurisich, Veterinary Officer, Perth .  History  H3N8 has been identified as the probable cause of the 1889‚Äì1890 flu pandemic in humans, and also another epidemic in 1898-1900. Before the identification of H3N8 as the likely cause of the 1889 pandemic, the H2N2 subtype was most commonly suggested as the likely cause. At this point, it is not possible to identify the viral subtype for either the 1889 or 1900 outbreak with certainty. A 1997 study found H3N8 was responsible for over one quarter of the influenza infections in wild ducks. In 1963, the H3N8 (A/equine/2/Miami/63) subtype created an epidemic of equine influenza in Miami and subsequently spread throughout North and South America and Europe, creating massive outbreaks during 1964 and 1965. Since 1963, the H3N8 virus has drifted along a single lineage at a rate of 0.8 amino acid substitutions per year. Between 1978 and 1981, there were widespread epidemics of the A/equine/2 strain throughout the US and Europe despite the development of vaccines. Since the late 1980s, evolution of the H3N8 virus has diverged into two families: an \\"American-like\\" lineage and a \\"European-like\\" lineage.Equine influenza virus by Wilson et al Route of transmission EIV can be spread by a few different routes. The ultimate source of the virus is respiratory tract secretions. Coughing horses can release the virus into the air, where it can spread up to 30‚Äì50 metres. It can also be spread by direct contact between horses, or indirectly via a person's hands or clothing, or on inanimate objects (e.g. buckets, tack, twitches). However, the virus doesn't survive outside of a horse for long Scot Weese, \\"Bug of the month:Equine influenza Virus\\"- EQUID BLOG, posted December 11, 2011. http://www.equidblog.com/2010/12/articles/another-category/influenza/bug-of- the-month-equine-influenza-virus/ The virus is delicate within the environment and easily killed by heat, cold, desiccation, and disinfectants.Equine influenza virus by Wilson et al. The virus multiplies in epithelial cells of upper respiratory tract. Dispersed by aerosol droplets when horse coughs or exhales. The virus can survive in the environment, on different surfaces, for up to 48 hours. Spread of the disease has been associated with the movement of people, pets, horse equipment and tack where proper biosecurity procedures have not been followed Subclinical infection with virus shedding can occur in vaccinated horses, particularly where there is a mismatch between the vaccine strains and the virus strains circulating in the field. Such infections contribute to the spread of the disease. Incubation period This is the time from when a horse gets exposed to the time when it gets sick. It is quite short for equine influenza: typically 1‚Äì3 days and up to 7 days. This makes disease control easier, as infected horses can be identified sooner, meaning that appropriate control measures can be enacted more quickly. Diseases that have very long incubation periods can be more difficult to control.  Diagnosis  Fever of 102.5- 105.0 F, frequent dry cough for several weeks, ‚Äòdrippy‚Äô nose with discharge and secondary bacterial infection are some of the clinical signs of Equine influenza virus infection. isolation of influenza virus from nasopharyngeal and or large rise in antibody titer in equine-1 or 2 serum can be used as diagnosis in horses. Other clinical findings may include a serous or light mucoid nasal discharge, epiphora, tender but rarely swollen submandibular lymph nodes, hyperemia of nasal and conjunctival mucosa, tachypnea, tachycardia, limb edema, muscle soreness and stiffness.  Period of infectivity  This is the length of time a horse can spread the virus after being infected. It is a very important concept, because horses can still infect other horses after they have gotten over their own illness. Viruses that are shed for long periods of time after a horse gets better are much harder to control. Horses tend to be most infectious (i.e. shedding the most virus) in the first 24‚Äì48 hours after they develop a fever, but they can shed the virus for up to 7‚Äì10 days after their signs of illness disappear. Pathophysiology Aerosolized influenza virus is inhaled and embeds in the respiratory mucosa, of the upper and lower respiratory tract. The virus is attracted to the glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides of the mucus coating the respiratory mucosa. If the infecting dose of virus is high, abundant viral neuraminidase breaks down the mucosal layer, allowing access of the virus to the underlying epithelial cells. The virus then attaches to epithelial cells through binding of the hemagglutinin spike to the N-acetylneuraminic acid receptor on the cell. The virus then enters the cell by endocytosis into the cell cytoplasm where it replicates to produce new virions that are released back into the respiratory tract by budding from the infected cell. The virus disperses throughout the trachea and bronchial tree within 3 days, causing hyperemia, edema, necrosis, desquamation, and focal erosion. Viremia is rare, but is possible if the virus crosses the basement membrane and enters the circulation, potentially causing inflammation of skeletal and cardiac muscle (myositis and myocarditis), encephalitic signs, and limb edema See also *Horse flu *Canine influenza References H3N8 Category:1889‚Äì1890 flu pandemic ","title":"Influenza A virus subtype H3N8"},{"id":"3907802","text":"Ada√≠lson Pereira Coelho, more commonly known as Abuda (born 28 March 1986 in S√£o Lu√≠s), is a Brazilian striker.

Tim Burton saw the film and was so impressed by its artistic vision that he went on to produce a feature-length adaptation also titled 9 (2009), directed by Acker and distributed by Focus Features. The film was presented at the Indianapolis International Film Festival. It was nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film, but lost to The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation, although it did win a Student Academy Award for Best Animation. Plot 9 is a sentient rag doll who appears to be the last of his kind, living in the ruins of a decaying, post-apocalyptic Earth. He is first seen making simple constructs out of refuse ‚Äì a swinging armature of scrap metal, an upright book with string tied around it, and a dummy rag doll full of tar, though the purpose behind these things is unclear at first. Hunting 9 relentlessly is the Cat Beast, a mechanical monster wearing a cat's skull for a head. It appears to be guided by a small glowing talisman which it holds in its claws. Sitting quietly, 9 stares into the mirrored surface of his own strange talisman and has a flashback. In the flashback, 9 searches the ruins with his mentor, 5, a one-eyed rag doll. They gather useful bits and pieces and store them in the cloth linings of their own skin. With 9's help, 5 is able to salvage a light bulb and operate it using pieces of wire and a watch battery. 5 gives the functional bulb to 9 for safe-keeping. Almost immediately after, 5 draws the mirrored talisman from inside his chest. It glows green, warning of danger. 5 gives the talisman to 9 then pushes him into cover. Extending a homemade folding spear, 5 steps out to confront the threat. But the Cat Beast circles behind him and snatches him up with a metal pincer, shearing off his right arm. Though he struggles, 5 can not break free, and the Cat Beast sucks 5's soul out through his mouth using its talisman, leaving 5 lifeless. Horrified, 9 escapes in panic, almost giving away his location to the Cat Beast by scraping the light bulb against a rock. 9 is woken from the memory by the warning green glow of the mirrored talisman. Taking the light bulb, which he has attached to the end of a staff, 9 flees into a ruined house. The Cat Beast follows and reveals that it has not only taken the other rag dolls' souls: it also wears their numbered skins like a garment. The number 5 shows prominently on its back. The Beast pounces on what it thinks is 9, but which turns out to be a marionette ‚Äì the dummy created by 9 at the beginning of the film. The Beast's claws stick in the tar and 9 is able to hop onto its back and steal the Beast's talisman. 9 leads the Beast on a panicked chase through the house and finally runs out onto the end of a broken plank, which extends over a several-story drop. Thinking it has 9 cornered, the Beast walks out onto the plank. But it has fallen into 9's trap. Nearby is the metal armature, and the upright book. 9 leaps off the plank onto the armature, which swings him around to the book. He kicks it and it falls into the pit. The string, tied at one end to the book, has its other end tied to the plank. The weight of the falling book drags the plank into the pit, and the Beast with it. The Beast crashes through a hole in the cellar floor and is presumably impaled by the sharp end of the falling plank. This all reveals that all the things that 9 has built was a cleverly-made trap for the Beast. Now free from fear, 9 salvages the skins of the other rag dolls and prepares them to be ceremonially burned. As he looks sadly at the skin of 5, the two talismans begin to glow. 9 realizes that they are two halves of a whole and puts them together. A beam of green light erupts from the united talisman, and the spirits of the eight slain rag dolls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 emerge, returning to their rag doll skins to be at peace. Before disappearing, 5's soul turns to 9 and nods in approval. In the morning, when the ashes have cooled, 9 ‚Äì bearing the light bulb staff, a symbol of the persistent light of knowledge and learning ‚Äì walks off into the wasteland, leaving the empty talisman behind in the sand. Production The short film took four and a half years, on and off, to create. Originally, Acker wanted to make it as stop motion, but then went for CGI when realizing it would have turned out too expensive. He used Maya 1.5‚Äì5.5 for 3D modeling, Photoshop for the textures, After Effects for compositing, and Premiere for editing. There are homages to Acker's influences like Brothers Quay and Pixar placed throughout. Most of it was rendered at 720x540 pixels on a three-computer dual-processor render farm. For distribution at film festivals like Sundance, Rhythm and Hues Studios offered to print the short film to 35mm using their film printer and image resizing techniques. The credits show that beyond Acker, there were five other animators and three other lighters that worked on the film. The music was provided by Eric Olsen and his band the Earganic.

Manx Scout logo prior to 2018 History The 1st Malew Group were the first Scout Group on the Isle of Man. Originally called 1st Isle of Man, they renamed the group because other contingents had become active. The Scouts' scarf and name tag are in red and white reflecting the close relations to the Air Scouts that they were originally. Close ties with Ireland The Isle of Man has attracted Irish Scouts. This was particularly the case under the patronage of Sir Charles Kerruish who facilitated the use of his own lands for Scout camping. Many groups fostered personal friendships with the Speaker of the House of Keys. In fact in 1979, as part of the island's celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of Tynwald, Sir Charles invited Irish Scouts to form part of the guard of honour for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II. All uniformed personnel present, including the Irish guests received a specially minted medal from the Queen. It was seen a great honour that, on arguably the largest celebration ever on the island, the close link with Irish Scouting was emphasised, as they stood side by side with Manx Scouts and the large military presence who were there to honour both the island itself and the Lord of Mann. World Scout Jamboree contingents In 2007 ten Manx Scouts and a Leader attended the 21st World Scout Jamboree as part of the Cumbria and Isle of Man Unit. In 2011 nine Manx Scout and a Leader attended the 22nd World Scout Jamboree as part of the contingent with Scouts from Cheshire. In 2015 three Scouts and one Leader attended the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan as part of an Isle of Man/Merseyside contingent. In 2019 the World Scout Jamboree will be hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico. Nine Scouts and one Leader will attend the 24th World Scout Jamboree as part of Unit 41, Isle of Man/Cumbria. Manx Scout badge with Triskelion Three Legs Challenge The Three Legs Challenge is a hiking challenge open to all Scouts and Scout Network members. Those who undertake the challenge must walk 3 of the island's long distance walkways within 12 months. Its name is derived from the Triskelion that is the island's national symbol. The routes are: * Leg One - The Heritage Way Beginning at the Quarterbridge in Douglas and follow the Heritage Way along the disused Railway Line to Peel. Finish is at the Peel Heritage Centre. Distance 10.5 miles. * Leg Two - Bayr ny Skeddan (Way of the Herring) Start at Castle Rushen in Castletown and follow the Bayr ny Skeddan to Peel. Finish at Peel Castle. Distance 15 miles. * Leg Three - Millennium Way Start at the bottom of Sky Hill, near Ramsey and follow the Millennium Way to Castletown. Finish at Castle Rushen. This hike can be completed in either one day or two consecutive days, camping overnight. Distance 26 miles. Hikes may be completed in any order, but all must be completed in the twelve-month period. It is possible to complete the hikes either way i.e. hike from Castletown to Sky Hill to complete the Millennium Way.

They were invented by the Czech writer Jaroslav Foglar. Rychl√© ≈°√≠py are universally known in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, virtually everyone is familiar with them. The name Mirek Du≈°√≠n has even become proverbial, referring to someone who is extremely upright, honest and hard- working, and usually used sarcastically. Mirek Du≈°√≠n to the Senate! Rychl√© ≈°√≠py was originally a comic series issued from 1938 to 1989 with stand-stills enforced by the Communist regime of Czechoslovakia. Whilst it was always Jaroslav Foglar who wrote the text, the first series was drawn by Dr. Jan Fischer https://www.lambiek.net/artists/f/fischer_jan.htm, the second series (around the Prague Spring 1968) was drawn by Marko ƒåerm√°k. The first series was issued in the magazines Mlad√Ω Hlasatel (\\"Young Herald\\") and Vp≈ôed (\\"Ahead\\"). Rychl√© ≈°√≠py are the main characters of the trilogy Dobrodru≈æstv√≠ v temn√Ωch uliƒçk√°ch (\\"Adventures in the Dark Alleys\\"): Z√°hada hlavolamu (\\"Mystery of the Puzzle\\", 1941), St√≠nadla se bou≈ô√≠ (\\"St√≠nadla in Revolt\\") and Tajemstv√≠ Velk√©ho Vonta (\\"Secret of the High Vont\\"). Mystery of the Conundrum was made into a movie in 1993 - director: Petr Kotek and a TV series in 1969 - director: Hynek Boƒçan. Its famous props include the Tleskaƒç flying bicycle, the mysterious Em, the dark alleys of St√≠nadla (\\"The Shades\\") and the song of the Vonts, which has no lyrics.  Locations  The most of the adventures from trilogy \\"Adventures in the Dark Alleys\\" (written by Jaroslav Foglar) happened in old town quarter called St√≠nadla, where lived boys organized in Vont organization, inimical to boys from other quarters and the whole quarter was introvertive. = Meaning of word St√≠nadla = St√≠nadla is an old Czech word, archaism, which is translated as \\"The Shades\\" but it is not exact. There is great similarity to the Czech word \\"st√≠n\\" (=shadow) but it is only a semblance. The real meaning of this old Czech word St√≠nadla is place of execution. This word came from word \\"st√≠nat\\" (=to behead). Boys from other parts of town often laughed at boys from St√≠nadla that they lived on a former execution place. That was also the reason for the rise of the Vont organization, which was established by Vojtƒõch Vont, the first High Vont (the head of the organization). Vonts (and their organization) have their name for his honor. Once organized they were able to arrange \\"punitive expeditions\\" to the other quarters to punish the local boys for the mockeries. Thanks to this organization Vonts achieved reputation and respect of youngsters from the other parts of town, who were no more laughing at them, but feared them instead.This early history of the Vonts is described in the book St√≠nadla in Revolt, when Rychl√© ≈°√≠py founded The First Vont Chronicle. There are several places in the Czech Republic named St√≠nadla, Na St√≠nadlech etc.; however, the old town quarter as described in the trilogy is fictional.

The offences in the Act were originally high treason under the Sedition Act 1661 (later the Treason Act 1795), and consequently the penalty was death.

Consequently, in 1848 three categories of treason (all derived from the 1795 Act) were reduced to felonies. (This occurred during a period when the death penalty in the United Kingdom was being abolished for a great many offences.) The Act does not prevent prosecutors from charging somebody with treason instead of treason felony if the same conduct amounts to both offences.Section 6. It is treason felony to \\"compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend\\": * to deprive the Queen of her crown, * to levy war against the Queen, or * to \\"move or stir\\" any foreigner to invade the United Kingdom or any other country belonging to the Queen.

A conviction required a confession in open court, or the evidence of two witnesses to prove the words spoken. Also a prosecution had to be brought within six days of the offence. Section 4 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1891.  Discussions  In 2001 The Guardian newspaper mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge to the Act in the High Court, alleging that the act \\"makes it a criminal offence, punishable by life imprisonment, to advocate abolition of the monarchy in print, even by peaceful means\\".Judgments - Regina v Her Majesty's Attorney General (Appellant) ex parte Rusbridger and another (Respondents). House of Lords. 26 June 2003 They sought a declaration that the Human Rights Act 1998 had altered its meaning so that only violent conduct was criminal. The court held that this was a hypothetical question that did not deserve an answer, since The Guardian was not being prosecuted. The case eventually went to the House of Lords on appeal in 2003. In a unanimous judgement the House agreed that the litigation was unnecessary, but most of the judges nevertheless agreed with (and none disagreed with) Lord Steyn's view that \\"the part of section 3 of the 1848 Act which appears to criminalise the advocacy of republicanism is a relic of a bygone age and does not fit into the fabric of our modern legal system. The idea that section 3 could survive scrutiny under the Human Rights Act is unreal.\\"R. (Rusbridger) v. Attorney General [2003] UKHL 38; [2004] AC 357; [2003] 3 All ER 784 In December 2013 the Ministry of Justice said that Section 3 of the Act, which had made it an offence punishable by life imprisonment to print, or otherwise \\"by any overt act or deed\\" to support the abolition of the monarchy or to \\"imagine, invent, devise, or intend to deprive or depose\\" the monarch, had been repealed in early 2013, without publicity. However, the Government later stated that the announcement that it had been repealed was wrong, and that it was still on the statute book.  Relevant cases  *R v. Mitchel (1848) 7 State Tr.

Origins He was the son of John Watson by his wife the sister of Sir Charles Wager (1666-1743), First Lord of the Admiralty. The armorials used by his son the 1st baronet (Argent, on a chevron engrailled azure between three martlets sable as many crescents orBurke's General & Heraldic Dictionary) are a differenced version of the arms of the Watson family, Marquess of Rockingham, and thus the family may have been a cadet branch of the latter. Naval career Watson entered the navy as a volunteer per order on in 1728. He was promoted lieutenant in 1734 and promoted captain and given command of in 1738. He transferred to HMS Plymouth in May 1741 and to HMS Dragon in November 1742 which he commanded in the Battle of Toulon. In 1746 he transferred to HMS Princess Louisa which he commanded at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747 and in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre in October 1747. In January 1748 he was appointed commander-in- chief of the Newfoundland and North American station with his flag in HMS Lion. He became governor of Newfoundland and commander-in-chief of Cape Breton. The position of governor of the colony had temporarily lapsed after the departure of Richard Edwards and therefore his successor, James Douglas, was not a governor of the island but commodore. No commodore nor governor was sent in 1747, but Charles Watson became the governor on arrival in 1748. As governor of Newfoundland he set about deporting Irish and Scots Catholics from the colony. The tomb of Charles Watson at St. John's Churchyard, Kolkata, India. In 1754 he became Commander-in-Chief, East Indies. The English settlement at Fort William, India sought assistance from the Presidency of Fort St. George at Madras, which sent Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson. They re-captured Calcutta on 2 January 1757, but the Nawab marched again on Calcutta on 5 February 1757, and was surprised by a dawn attack by the English. This resulted in the Treaty of Alinagar on 7 February 1757. However the Nawab was subsequently bolstered by French support, and the Battle of Chandannagar in March, and then the Battle of Plassey in June 1757, followed. Watson was promoted to Vice-Admiral of the White in 1757. Watson's quick rise through the ranks is thought to be attributed from his uncle, Sir Charles Wager, who was first lord of the admiralty. There is a memorial to Watson in Westminster Abbey, London. Marriage and children He married in 1741 Rebecca Buller, a daughter of John Francis Buller (1695-1751) of Morval in Cornwall.Rebecca Buller omitted from: http://www.thepeerage.com/p12594.htm#i125939.

Penguin Books, 2004. 1944) was a German general during World War II who commanded the 7th Army during the Invasion of France and the early phases of the Allied invasion of Normandy until his death in June 1944. World War I Born in 1882, Dollmann joined the army in 1899.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, p. 120. He studied in the War Academy for General Staff starting in 1909. He served as an aerial observer for the first two years of the First World War.Hackl (1989). Die Bayerische Kriegsakademie (1867‚Äì1914), p. 424. Dollmann was assigned to the wartime General Staff on 5 November 1917, as part of the 6th Infantry Division. He was transferred to the Bavarian General Staff, where on 21 January 1918 he took command of the 6th Army.Bradley ed., (1994). Die Generale des Heeres 1921‚Äì1945.

In March 1919, he was appointed to the Ministry of Military Affairs and then onto the Peace Commission of the General Staff. Once this assignment was completed, Dollmann served in the central office of the General Staff. Starting 1 October 1919, he worked as a staff officer in the newly created Reichswehr Group Command IV of the Provisional Reichswehr in Munich, a post he retained for one year. On 1 October 1920, he was briefly employed as Adjutant of the Artillery Commander XXI before being assigned commander of the VII Artillery Division. Dollmann was transferred to the staff of the 7th (Bavarian) Division on 1 April 1923. Promoted to lieutenant colonel by this point, Dollmann then went from the First Division of the 7th (Bavarian) Artillery Regiment at W√ºrzburg and on 1 February 1928, he took over as commander of this unit. Following this assignment, Dollmann then returned to a former unit and became Chief of the General Staff of the 7th (Bavarian) Division. During the next few years, Dollmann held various positions, spent some time in the higher artillery command of the Reichswehr, commanded the 6th (Prussian) Artillery Regiment from 1 February 1931 in Minden, and rose to the rank of lieutenant general in 1933. Interwar era He took over as Chief of Artillery in the Defense Ministry on 1 February 1933. Subsequent his brief time as commander of army service Kassel in October 1934, he was appointed Commander of the Military District IX (Hesse-Thuringia West) on 1 May 1935.Bradley ed., (1994).

Having distinguished himself, Dollmann was promoted at the end of 1936 to the rank of full general, along with 11 other officers of the twelve Wehrkreise.Telford Taylor named the others promoted to General (of which Dollmann is included) in the following order: von Brauchitsch, Blaskowitz, von Witzleben, List, Geyer, von Kluge, von Reichenau, von Kleist, Dollmann, Knochenhauer, Ulex, and Kress von Kressenstein. See: Taylor (1995)[1952]. Sword and Swastika: Generals and Nazis in the Third Reich, p. 107. Many historians who have analyzed Dollmann's career and life note that while he did exhibit on occasion a pro-Nazi attitude, they assert that he was not a committed Nazi.Brett-Smith (1976). Hitler's Generals, p. 102. On the other hand, historian notes that Dollmann's orders were imbued with a discernible Nazi impetus. He therefore believes that Dollmann had a stronger inclination to National Socialism than otherwise presumed.M√ºller (1969). Das Heer und Hitler, pp. 193‚Äì202. A directive from Dollmann dated 8 February 1935 shows that he instructed his officers to cooperate fully with the authorities of the NSDAP. There is also evidence that he demanded that all his officers should fully support the Nazi Party and admonished them to adjust their opinions accordingly; he even insisted that his officers‚Äô wives should actively participate in the National Socialist Women's League. Along similar lines, Dollmann expected his officers to hang pictures of the F√ºhrer in their offices and in the mess hall instead of pictures of the Kaiser.M√ºller (1969). Das Heer und Hitler, p. 193. In 1937, Dollmann harangued Catholic chaplains for not being fervent enough in their support of the Nazi regime, telling them that as members of the Wehrmacht and bearers of National Socialism, they should always display \\"a clear and unresolved acknowledgment of the F√ºhrer, State, and People!\\"Brett-Smith (1976). Hitler's Generals, pp. 102‚Äì103. On 25 August 1939, Dollmann was elevated to commander of the 7th Army. Just under a week later Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland. Dollmann's only son, who had aspired to the rank of lieutenant in the 15th Infantry Regiment, was killed during the campaign against Poland.Wilhelm von Leeb (1976). Tagebuchaufzeichnungen und Lagebeurteilungen aus zwei Weltkriegen, p. 182. Invasion of France Dollman inspects an artillery observation post that bears his name, near the French border, 1940 During the invasion of France in 1940, Dollmann‚Äôs assignment placed him at the southern edge of the Siegfried Line,The defensive line constructed along the western frontier of Germany before World War II. It was also known as the Hindenburg Line. opposite the Maginot Line. While the French Maginot Line had proven impregnable to frontal assault in the past, Hitler was unconcerned, as its defenses were easily outflanked during the invasion.Kershaw (2001). Hitler: 1936‚Äì1945, Nemesis, p. 265. Throughout the invasion of France, Dollmann‚Äôs 7th Army was not placed on the offensive until most of the French army had been destroyed, at which point he linked up with the 1st Panzer Division of Panzer Group Guderian, encircling 400,000 French troops in the Vosges Mountains ‚Äì an action which was followed by a French surrender.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, pp. 121‚Äì122. Hitler rewarded the participating generals with promotions for their part in this mission, including Dollmann, who thereby attained the rank of Generaloberst (Colonel General).Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, p. 122. Occupation of France In the wake of the French defeat, Dollmann's 7th Army remained in the West. Along with Generalfeldmarschall Erwin von Witzleben, Dollmann was the only commander of the western campaign who did not see service against the Soviet Union along the Eastern Front. Military historians suggest that the reason might be that Dollmann was considered too inflexible and technically unsuitable for the warfare in the East.Lieb (2007). Konventioneller Krieg oder NS-Weltanschauungskrieg. Kriegf√ºhrung und Partisanenbek√§mpfung in Frankreich 1943/44, pp. 87‚Äì88. For reasons that remain unknown, Dollmann began having serious doubts about the Nazi regime and where his country was headed. Dollmann did not keep up with contemporary tactical military developments nor did he follow the course of the war all that closely. Instead he became complacent, overweight, and followed the lead of his immediate superior, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, neglecting the coastal defenses of France in the process. Rundstedt believed that the best strategy was to allow the Allies to land, build up their forces, and wait for them to advance inland. The Germans could then destroy the Allies in blitzkrieg maneuvers as they attempted to make their way deeper into France. This way, the Germans would be well out of the range of Allied naval guns and could easily secure an advantage.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, pp. 122‚Äì123. Dollmann (left) in conversation with Lieutenant- General Edgar Feuchtinger (2nd from right) and Rommel, France 1944 For four years, Dollmann and Rundstedt did little to fortify the defensive positions along the French coast. Only when his command came under Army Group B Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's scrutiny in December 1943 did Dollmann begin decisive and feverish construction to improve French coastal fortifications. But it was too late.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, p. 123. Dollmann's chief of staff claimed that efforts to strengthen the defensive section were not supported by the higher leadership.Max Pemsel (1974). Generaloberst Friedrich Dollmann in Deutsches Soldatenjahrbuch, p. 19. Dollman tried to enjoy his time living in France during the occupation, frequently attending religious services and visiting cathedrals and museums. At the same time he fell into a deep depression and let himself go, overindulging in wine and cigars.Lieb (2007). Konventioneller Krieg oder NS-Weltanschauungskrieg. Kriegf√ºhrung und Partisanenbek√§mpfung in Frankreich 1943/44, pp. 86‚Äì87. Meanwhile, Dollmann's deteriorating health was mirrored in his diminishing knowledge of battlefield tactics and the importance of air superiority ‚Äì all of which made him under-prepared for the imminent Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day. Nevertheless, Dollmann was considered an experienced commander; there was no reason to think him incapable. Supporting this notion was an Allied report which identified Dollmann as an \\"expert in defense\\". Panzer Group West Commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg later confirmed that Dollmann had a much better understanding of the use of armored troops than was previously supposed.Detlef Vogel, \\"Deutsche und alliierte Kriegf√ºhrung im Westen\\", in Horst Boog, Gerhard Krebs, Detlef Vogel eds., Das Deutsche Reich in der Defensive (Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg), vol. vii, p. 521. History was soon to prove that the German defenses were inadequate to repulse the massive and highly coordinated assault which took place on 6 June 1944.Harrison (1993). Cross-Channel Attack, pp. 269‚Äì335. D-Day Up to 60 German divisions were tasked with defending of coastline from the Riviera to the North Sea, composed of varying troops ‚Äì Cossacks, Volga Tartars, Georgians, among others, equipped with weapons captured from France, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Aside from what he considered troop deficiencies, Rundstedt thought it ludicrous to scatter the German troops so thinly along the French coast, and disagreed with Rommel's ideas for the Atlantic Wall.Overy (1997). Why the Allies Won, p. 155. The fortifications were inconsistent, with some sections well-constructed while other sections left much to be desired. Also, the ability to direct fire and the capability to deliver firepower along the varying portions of shoreline were equally unreliable.Goerlitz (1985). History of the German General Staff, 1657‚Äì1945, p. 454. Several days prior to the invasion, the Germans received intelligence reports about the activities occurring across the channel. Deception measures by the Allied intelligence services kept the Germans convinced that the attack would occur near Norway or close to Calais.Evans (2010). The Third Reich at War, p. 623. Although reconnaissance reports as late as 5 June 1944 indicated that something significant was afoot, none of this intelligence was relayed to the OKW at Berchtesgaden, nor was it forwarded to Dollmann‚Äôs 7th Army.Kershaw (2001). Hitler: 1936‚Äì1945, Nemesis, p. 638. It is doubtful whether this would have led to a redistribution of forces, since Hitler remained convinced that the main Allied attack would occur at Pas de Calais.Goerlitz (1985). History of the German General Staff, 1657‚Äì1945, p. 458. On 5 June 1944, under the cover of darkness, the invasion at Normandy began. By nightfall June 6, up to 130,000 troops and 20,000 Allied tanks were ashore under a curtain of naval bombardment. On Dollmann's orders, a series of mapping war games was underway in Rennes, which meant that he, as well as his corps and division commanders, were not with their respective units at the time of the attack.Mitcham (1997). The Desert Fox in Normandy: Rommel's Defense of Fortress Europe, p. 64. Dollmann tried to organize an immediate counter-attack with the 21st Panzer Division. Lieutenant General Fritz Bayerlein protested; he felt a column march in daytime was merely an invitation to the Allied air forces to decimate his division. He suggested alternative plans, but Dollmann remained adamant. This proved a costly mistake. Throughout the night of 6‚Äì7 June 1944, the Allies used their knowledge of the location of the German columns and flares to illuminate the enemy to find suitable targets to attack from the air. The 21st Panzer Division lost 5 tanks, 40 tank trucks, and 84 other vehicles destroyed.Brett-Smith (1976). Hitler's Generals, p. 104. The depleted Panzer division left Rommel at a disadvantage in trying to arrange a counterattack, and so it was not until 9 June 1944 that he was able to muster his forces.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, p. 124. Obtaining naval support or aerial cover from the Luftwaffe proved to be impossible. Not only were the Germans under-equipped compared to the Allies, the command and control requirements for coordinated attack and defense were hindered by a labyrinthine military and administrative bureaucracy, and the highest offices of leadership remained intransigent about the actual strategic situation. These factors made Rommel‚Äôs job of coastal defense nearly impossible.Magenheimer (2003). Hitler‚Äôs War: Germany‚Äôs Key Strategic Decisions, 1940‚Äì1945, pp. 245‚Äì253. Despite the desperate circumstances, Rommel, Rundstedt, and Dollmann kept fighting. Part of the effort to repel the Allied attack included strategic placement of troops over what appeared to be a growing front. Dollman's 7th Army (over 16 divisions and five corps commands) was sent to the left wing of the invasion front. They learned on 21 June 1944 that the supplies needed to conduct a sustained resistance could not be assured.Wegm√ºller (1986). Die Abwehr der Invasion. Die Konzeption des Oberbefehlshabers West 1940‚Äì1944, p. 244. Although they rendered vigorous resistance, the German forces could only slow the Allied advance. Throughout the course of defending the coastline and in spite of the disastrous circumstances, Dollmann continued to discipline his soldiers by the threat of severe penalties.Lieb (2007). Konventioneller Krieg oder NS- Weltanschauungskrieg. Kriegf√ºhrung und Partisanenbek√§mpfung in Frankreich 1943/44, p. 421. Inaccurate Wehrmacht intelligence reports and Hitler's assurance that a second invasion was due at any moment left the equivalent of an entire German Army Group, comprising 5 Luftwaffe divisions, two Panzer divisions, and 24 infantry divisions, sitting immobile awaiting further instructions. In the meantime, the German High Command issued orders for Rommel and Rundstedt to launch a massive armored counterattack against an Allied force of \\"929,000 men, 177,000 vehicles, and 586,000 tons of materiel,\\" an order which was impossible to obey.Mitcham (1997). The Desert Fox in Normandy: Rommel's Defense of Fortress Europe, p. 142. Cherbourg and death The French port of Cherbourg fell on 26 June 1944, and was surrendered by Lieutenant General Karl-Wilhelm von Schlieben. This enraged Hitler and prompted a court-martial investigation from Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel. Hitler summoned Rundstedt and Dollmann to Berchtesgaden on 28 June 1944 and insisted that Dollmann be court-martialed. Rundstedt rejected this idea since Dollmann was no more accountable for the failure than himself. Still unsatisfied, Hitler demanded that Dollmann at the very least should be relieved of command, which stimulated another defense, this time from Rommel. Undeterred, Hitler waited until the men left to relieve Dollmann of command, replacing him with SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Paul Hausser.Mitcham & Mueller (2012). Hitler‚Äôs Commanders: Officers of the Wehrmacht, the Luftwaffe, the Kriegsmarine, and the Waffen-SS, pp. 124‚Äì125. Hitler relieved Rundstedt of command a short time later.Barnett (2003). Hitler‚Äôs Generals, p. 200. Unaware that he had been relieved of command, Dollmann was nonetheless worn out and stressed. He died on 29 June 1944. The exact circumstances of the death of Dollmann remain controversial. Some sources say he suffered a heart attack, while others claim he committed suicide by taking poison.Meyer, H: The 12th SS, p. 425. Stackpole Books, 2005. In 1973, Dollmann's last chief of staff Lieutenant General Max-Josef Pemsel, wrote that on 29 June at around 3:00 am in the morning, Dollmann bid farewell to his staff and committed suicide in his command post.Max Pemsel: Generaloberst Friedrich Dollmann.

The film earned several awards, including the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film. Plot After a doctor informs Donnelly (Gleeson) that his wife died at 3 o'clock in the morning, he brings Donnelly to his wife's bedside to say goodbye, then excusing himself as the doctor is unusually busy: there'd been two cot deaths, and a woman shot so brutally by her son 'she had no head left on her'. Donnelly spends a few final moments awkwardly talking to his wife and gives her a photo of 'David', their pet rabbit. While on a train ride home, Donnelly sits opposite a chain-smoking kid (Conroy), who reveals himself to be a manic foul-mouth. In his forlorn state, Donnelly tolerates the kid, allowing himself to be engaged in some inane conversations. Less accepting of the kid's abrasive manners are a couple sitting across the aisle. After some animated exchanges, the kid leaves to get something from the buffet cart. At this time, Donnelly inquires, and learns that the couple just lost their son from a cot death. The kid returns after the couple leaves their seats, where Donnelly tells the kid about the baby's death. The kid seems surprised and immediately asks, 'Did they kill \\"it\\"?'. When Donnelly explains that it was 'cot death', the kid asserts that they must have 'banged it on something'. Upon the couple's return, things heat up. The two almost come to blows, but Donnelly steps in. Donnelly goes to the buffet cart to get a drink. The man comes out to get tea and engages Donnelly in a brief conversation. With her husband gone, the woman is now left alone with the kid, who quickly moves to harass her as she clutches a picture of her deceased baby. He accuses her of 'bang[ing] it on something', because the baby was 'ugly'. Aghast, the woman steps on a table to get away from him, only to trip, fall, and tear the photo. Moments later, the kid, now back in his own seat, is startled by a thump at the window; the woman had thrown herself out of the train. He goes to investigate, to discover an open gate with the torn picture of the baby on the floor. Donnelly and the husband return. The kid nonchalantly informs the husband that his wife has jumped off the train, and is 'dripping down the half of it'. The husband takes this as a joke, and sets out to look for his wife. When Donnelly turns to see the blood on the window, he pulls the emergency stop. The police arrive and the man learns of his wife's suicide. Donnelly and the kid are questioned by a policeman, who questions the kid: 'Do I know you from somewhere?'. As the train departs, the policeman sees the kid wildly waving goodbye, and realizes he is 'wanted'. He orders the train stopped, 'and tell the boys to get the guns out'. On their way again, the kid tries to get Donnelly to take his side. When he gets no sympathy, the kid reveals that HIS mother was murdered last night, but he's not mourning. Donnelly tells the kid that his wife just died as well, and begins to weep. The kid again presses Donnelly with his 'deadly' story of a cow with trapped wind. Donnelly capitulates, and the kid tells his 'true' story, which is so bizarre that Donnelly can't help but laugh. 'Best day of me fucking life ‚Äì that cow exploding', the kid concludes. As the train pulls into the station, Donnelly notices armed cops everywhere. He realises that the kid is responsible for the matricide mentioned by the doctor in the opening scene. A shootout between the kid and the cops ensues, which leaves the kid mortally wounded. His last words are regrets that he didn't even hit one policeman. The kid dies as Donnelly cradles him. He then takes one of the kid's six shooters and hides it in his coat. At home, Donnelly prepares to kill himself. He looks in the gun which contains two bullets. As he is about to shoot himself, he hears scratching sounds from David, his wife's pet rabbit. He takes David in his lap, and tells the rabbit: 'I'll be following you shortly', before shooting it in the head. Moving the gun to his own head, Donnelly fumbles and drops it, accidentally discharging its last bullet. He looks at the smoking six shooter, then at the dead rabbit in his arms. He sighs, looks skyward and moans, 'Oh Jesus; what a fuckin day.'

One full- sized example was begun but never completed due to lack of funding. Background In 1841, the United States was in the midst of a war scare with the United Kingdom over the American boundary with Canada, among other issues. Americans remembered the British invasion of the United States by sea during the War of 1812 and, to avoid its recurrence, President John Tyler and Secretary of the Navy Abel P. Upshur called for a large increase in the size of the U.S. Navy in order to defend the coast. A like-minded U.S. Congress authorized the use of $8,500,000 (USD) to fund the expansion. In this environment, Robert L. Stevens and Edwin Augustus Stevens, the sons of Colonel John Stevens of Hoboken, New Jersey, proposed to the Department of the Navy on August 13, 1841 the construction of a revolutionary steam-powered ironclad vessel of high speed, with screw propellers and all machinery below the water line. Congress passed and President Tyler signed the Stevens Battery Act the same year to authorize funding for the construction of the ship, and the U.S. Navy's Board of Commissioners approved the Stevens brothers' specific proposal for the ship in January 1842. An Act of Congress authorizing Upshur to contract for the construction of a shot- and shell-proof steamer, to be built principally of iron, on the Stevens plan was approved on April 14, 1842. The ship, which became known as the \\"Stevens Battery,\\" was to be the first such ship ever to be built under government authorization. She was intended to serve as a fast, powerful, heavily armored, mobile battery, reinforcing the coastal fortifications of New York City. The Stevens brothers selected their family estate in Hoboken, New Jersey, as the construction site for the ship. They had to have a drydock dug out of solid rock there, and then install large pumps to keep the drydock from flooding, and delays occurred from the very beginning of the project. The budget for the ship was set at $600,000 (USD), based on vaguely similar earlier ships, but in fact the new ship was revolutionary in concept and design that no one really knew how to build her or how much she would cost. The 1844 design The Stevens' original design for the ship was completed in 1844 and called for a 250-foot- (76-meter-) long ship 40 feet (12.2 m) in beam and displacing 1,500 tons. She was to be armed with six large-caliber muzzle-loading cannons in open casemates on decks, loaded from below the main deck by gun crews protected by armored casemates employing sloped armor to further improve protection. She was to be proof against 64-pound (29-kilogram) shells, the largest fired by U.S. Navy guns at the time. To achieve this, she was to be armored with 4.5-inch- (114-millimeter-) thick iron plate reinforced by 14 inches (356 millimeters) of locust timber, a thickness of iron and wood believed by the Stevens to be sufficient to resist any gun then known. Furthermore, she was to be semisubmersible, able to submerge herself to her gunwales to make her a smaller target for enemy gunners. Her steam engines were to produce 900 indicated horsepower (ihp) and give her an estimated top speed of 18 knots (33 km/hr), and this very high speed for the era combined with good maneuverability were intended to make her a hard target to hit as well. Experiments by John Ericsson with his 12-inch (305-mm) wrought iron gun Oregon, which could fire a 225-pound (102-kilogram) shell 5 miles (9.25 kilometers), soon proved that 4.5-inch (114-millimeter) armor was insufficient. In March 1845, Robert Stevens' health failed and he spent the next two years recuperating in Europe. His absence and the need to rethink the ship's armor scheme led to little work being done on her for several years. In 1851, Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft ordered work on the ship stopped because of her inadequate armor, and Commodore Charles W. Skinner, chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction announced his intention to scrap the incomplete ship and sell her materials. The 1854 design The Stevens brothers succeeded in getting Congress to overrule Bancroft and Skinner, and set about radically redesigning the Stevens Battery. The new design was ready by January 1854. It called for a great increase in the ship's size and capabilities. She was now to be 420 feet (128 m) long, 53 feet (16 m) in beam, and displace 4,683 tons. She was to be proof against 125-pound (56.7-kilogram) shells, with armor made up of 6.75-inch (171-millimeter) iron plates sloping upwards from 1 foot (0.3 m) below the waterline to the main deck and running along the entire side of the ship from stem to stern. She was to have bulwarks to make her more seaworthy when steaming which could be lowered to reduce her freeboard in combat, making her a smaller target. Again, the ship was to be semisubmersible, able to submerge herself down to the gunwales, also to make her a smaller target. Her armament was to consist of two 10-inch (254-millimeter) rifled guns mounted on pivots fore and aft and five 15-inch (381-mm) smoothbore guns mounted on the deck above an armored casemate. The guns were to fire 425-pound (193-kilogram) shells. The gun crews, protected by the casemates, would load the guns from below through holes in the deck protected by armored hoods; the gun's muzzle would be pointed into the hole, and a steam-powered cylinder would use a ramrod to load the gun for the next shot, allowing a high rate of fire. Water was to be injected into each gun automatically after it fired, to cool the gun and prevent it from being damaged by extended, rapid firing. The ship was to have eight steam engines generating to drive two propellers and give the ship a maximum speed of , breathtakingly fast for the time. She would have consumed a lot of coal, and her 1,000-ton coal capacity suggests that she would have had a very short operating range. She was to be the first ship equipped with fan-driven ventilation, to increase crew comfort by extracting fumes and hot air from below decks. The Stevens brothers made significant progress on the newly designed ship between January 1854 and September 1855, but then work slowed again. When Robert Stevens died in April 1856, worked stopped entirely, and did not resume until 1859. The Navy by then was losing interest in the ship. By 1861, it had spent $500,000 (U.S.) on the project, and the Stevens family had spent another $228,435 (U.S.). That year, Edwin Stevens and his brother John C. Stevens offered to pay for completion of the ship themselves if the Navy would agree to pay for the ship if it was completed and proved successful, but a Navy board rejected the offer, finding deficiencies in the project. It was not clear when the ship would be completed, and in 1862 Edwin Stevens estimated that it would take another $730,484 (U.S.) just to complete the ship enough for to be launched. The Civil War and USS Naugatuck When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Edwin Stevens claimed that a completed Stevens Battery would have a decisive impact against Confederate forces. Hoping to prove his point, he purchased an iron-hulled steamer and modified her greatly into a warship that would demonstrate to the U.S. Navy some of the principles he had in mind for the Stevens Battery, including high maneuverability, a respectable top speed, a semisubmersible capability, and a large gun on the main deck capable of a high rate of fire and loaded from below the deck by gun crews protected by armor. The resulting vessel, Naugatuck, went into service with the United States Revenue-Marine in the autumn of 1861, but soon was loaned to the Navy. In action in May 1862, her main gun burst. Her armor protected the gun crew from the explosion as Stevens intended, but the Navy was not won over by the design, and Naugatuck soon went back to the Revenue-Marine. Although the Navy had a large ironclad program during the Civil War for which the Stevens Battery seemed a logical fit, a Navy board found numerous deficiencies in the ship and the Navy decided not to spend any more money on her. On July 17, 1862, Congress voted to turn all ownership of and rights to the Stevens Battery over to the Stevens family, and the ship spent the Civil War in her drydock. The 1869 design Edwin Stevens died in 1868, leaving the Stevens Battery and $1,000,000 (USD) with which to finish her to the State of New Jersey. New Jersey Governor Theodore F. Randolph appointed an oversight commission, and Major General George B. McClellan, the commander of the Army of the Potomac early in the Civil War, became engineer-in-chief. McClellan redesigned the ship yet again. The 1866 Battle of Lissa, in which ramming had proven an important tactic, was influential in ship design for 40 years, and his 1869 design called for the ship to have an iron spur ram bow. She also was to have a heavier hull. Instead of guns mounted in casemates, the Stevens Battery now was to have her guns in a revolving turret like that of USS Monitor, although the type and caliber of guns were never determined. Her machinery was removed and replaced by ten large-diameter boilers and two Maudsley and Field vertical overhead- crosshead steam engines which were to give the Stevens Battery a top speed of . The end By 1874, all the money for her completion was gone, and the ship was not yet ready for launching even after the Stevens family had spent $2,000,000 (USD) on her since proposing her in 1841. McClellan estimated that she would require another $450,000 (USD) just to reach a state where she could be launched, with more necessary to fit her out after that. No more money was available from the Stevens family, Robert and Edwin Stevens both were dead, and the last hope to make something out of the project was to sell the ship. A possible sale to Prussia fell through, and there were no other potential buyers. Most of the ship's machinery was sold in 1874 and 1875, and the ship was sold for scrap at public auction in 1881. The scrappers had to use blasting to dismantle her hull. The Stevens Battery in many ways was far ahead of her time when proposed in 1841, and remained a revolutionary design with potential capabilities far beyond the norm for her times. But her first design proved inadequate in the face of the advance of gun technology, her second design took too long to build and never found favor with the U.S. Navy, and her third design, although modernized, came too late to salvage the project before it ran out of money. Had the Stevens Battery ever put to sea in the 1840s, 1850s, or 1860s, she might have set a new standard for the time in naval design.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 7 April 1932 by Methuen & Co., London. In the United States, it was serialised in Collier's Weekly from 4 July to 1 August 1931 under the title The Medicine Girl, and was included under that name in the US collection The Crime Wave at Blandings (1937).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 61‚Äì62, A46. The novel was adapted from Wodehouse's play, Good Morning, Bill (1927), which was itself based on a work by the Hungarian playwright Ladislaus Fodor.Taves (2006), pp. 169‚Äì170. The story tells of golf expert Dr. Sally Smith, and of Bill Bannister, who loves her. Plot At golfing seaside resort Bingley-on-Sea, nerve specialist Sir Hugo Drake is impressed by the golfing skill of Dr. Sally Smith, an American general practitioner. Sir Hugo tells her he is looking for his nephew William \\"Bill\\" Bannister. Bill was seen with a woman of flashy appearance at Bingley. Bill is rich and impulsive, with a habit of falling in love at first sight. Sir Hugo regards himself as a parent figure to Bill, and has come to take him back to Bill's country house, Woollam Chersey in Hampshire. Nearby in a hotel, \\"Squiffy\\" Bixby, Lord Tidmouth, who has divorced four times, sees his first ex-wife, Charlotte \\"Lottie\\" Higginbotham, who has a maid, Marie. Lottie was formerly on the stage but married a rich man. She is now a widow, and sort of engaged to Bill, an old friend of Tidmouth's. Bill does not want to marry Lottie anymore. Tidmouth explains this tactlessly to Lottie and she faints. Bill tells the hotel bell-boy and also Tidmouth to get a doctor. To Bill's surprise, the bell-boy brings Sally, whom Bill has fallen in love with. Bill nervously confesses his feelings for her. Sally says in an unemotional way that if she ever loves a man she will inform him simply as if she were saying good morning, but says she still has not met the right man. Tidmouth brings another doctor, Sir Hugo. Sir Hugo agrees with Sally that Lottie only needs rest and tells Bill to go home. Around two weeks later, Bill, Sir Hugo, and Tidmouth are all at Bill's country house. Bill is in a bad mood because of his unrequited love for Sally, though Sir Hugo thinks he is pining for Lottie. Sir Hugo invites Lottie to the house, believing that in the old aristocratic manor, she will be clearly out of place and Bill will lose interest in her. Bill confides in Tidmouth that he is in love with Sally and that he telephoned her earlier. Pretending to be his own valet, he told her that Bill was seriously ill and needed a doctor so that she would come. Bill keeps all this secret from his busybody uncle. Sally reflects that she finds Bill agreeable but she does not want to marry an idle person who does not work and lives on inherited money. When Sally arrives at the house, she sees that Bill is healthy and remains aloof when he tries to tell her his feelings again. It is late, and Sally decides to sleep in a room in the house. Lottie arrives, and Tidmouth tries to tell Bill that they have a visitor, but Bill mistakenly thinks Tidmouth is referring to Sally. Sally sees Lottie at the house and thinks she and Bill are still romantically involved. The next morning, Sir Hugo learns from Bill that a lady arrived the previous night and, thinking Bill is referring to Lottie, is disappointed when Bill says that he loves her. Sir Hugo tells Lottie he does not want Bill to marry her. At first she is insulted, but Sir Hugo convinces her that she would be bored with Bill, who does not like dancing or partying in town like she does. She is much more similar to Tidmouth. Lottie and Tidmouth agree that they suit each other and want to get married again. Tidmouth informs Sally that Lottie is only at the house because she was invited by Sir Hugo. Bill finally makes it clear to Sir Hugo that he loves Sally, which pleases Sir Hugo, who greatly admires Sally's skill at golf. Sally continues to turn down Bill until she sees him do some paperwork for his dairy farm. Seeing that he does in fact work, she now loves him and says good morning to him.

Mythological history  In this mythological history, the name of goddess Anusuya and her husband, Atri, is primarily recorded as wife and husband. It is a matter of time that Mother Anasuya Trideva became absorbed in the strictest tenacity for obtaining a son like Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, which made Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati feel uneasy, the wife goddesses of the three Gods. The three said to their husbands that they should go to the people and go there and take the examination of Goddess Anusuya. At the behest of Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh Sannyasis, the people of the earth went to take a test of the ascetic Goddess Anusuya. Tried to go near the sannyasi, Tridev asked him to beg, but he had a condition too. To take the examination of the favor of Anusuya, Tridev told them that he had come to ask for alms but he should not go begging in his normal form but in the nude state of Anusuya. Artha Devi Anusuya will be able to give them an alms only when she is naked in front of Tridev Please listen to this. After listening to this story, the disciplined first started fluttering but after a little bit of rehearsing, Defining water poured on three monks. When the water sprinkled, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh all changed into infant form. After taking the baby form, Anusuya breastfed them as a beggar. When Anushuya's husband Atri came back home, Anusuya called them the secret of three children. Atri had already seen the entire development with his divine vision. Atri embraced the three children and with their power, they converted three children into one child, with three heads and six hands. Due to Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh's not returning to heaven, his wives became worried and came to Goddess Aasuya himself. Saraswati, Lakshmi, Parvati urged them to give back their respective husbands. Anusuya and her husband accepted the suggestion of the three ladies and Tridev came into their real form. After being pleased and impressed by Anusuya and Atri, Tridev gave them Dattatreya's son as a gift, which was the embodiment of these three gods. Dattatreya's body was one but he had three heads and six arms. Dattatreya, in particular, is considered to be the incarnation of Vishnu. Dattatreya's other two brothers were Chandra Deva and Rishi Durvasha. Brahma and Rishi Durvasha are considered to be the form of Shiva to the Moon. On the day Dattatreya was born, people of Hindu religion celebrate that day as Dattatreya Jayanti. ‡§™‡§Ç‡§°‡§ø‡§§‡§ú‡•ÄPanditji.jpgEntrance to the small cave temple atop Guru Shikar.

Origin and early career He was the son of al-Aghlab, a Khurasani who had been a companion of Abu Muslim during the Abbasid Revolution. He had served as governor of Ifriqiya in 785‚Äì787, being killed during the revolt of al-Hasan ibn Harb. The Encyclopaedia of Islam describes Ibrahim as \\"energetic and wise, prudent and shrewd, a brave fighter as well as skilful diplomat\\", and of considerable education, including in Islamic jurisprudence, as well as talented in poetry and oratory. In 795, Ibrahim was appointed governor of the Zab. From that position he played a leading role in the suppression of a revolt against the Abbasid governor of Ifriqya, Muhammad ibn Muqatil al-Akki. As a reward, on 9 July 800 Caliph Harun al-Rashid recognized him as emir of Ifriqiya, and bestowed virtually complete independence in exchange for an annual payment of 40,000 gold dinars to the Abbasid treasury. This allowed Ibrahim and his successors to establish the hereditary Aghlabid dynasty. Reign Ibrahim was successful in subduing the last Berber uprisings that had continued since the Great Berber Revolt, although the southern part of the Maghreb had to be given up for lost, and the Berbers there allowed to keep their Kharijite or Shi'a beliefs, which a century later would provide the basis for the downfall of the Aghlabids to the Shi'a Fatimids. Domestically, Ibrahim and his successors faced constant opposition from the Arab settler community (jund) in Tunis and Kairouan, which was jealous of their prerogatives and oppressed the native population. In addition, Ibrahim was a Mu'tazili Muslim, and in opposition to the Maliki jurists of Kairouan. He named Abu Muhriz, a Mu'tazili imam, as Qadi (Shari'a magistrate) Qayrawan (cadi of Kairouan) in 806. Ibrahim faced two revolts from the jund, one by Hamdis ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Kindi in 802, and another by Imran ibn Mukhallad in 809. As a result, Ibrahim established the palace city of al-Abbasiyya (or al-Qasr al-Qadim), just south of Kairouan, and imported a large number of black African slave soldiers to lessen his dependence on the jund. On his death on 5 July 812, he was succeeded by his son Abdallah I (). References Sources *Hitti, Philip K. A History of the Arabs, 5th ed.

At the age of 13 he went to further his studies at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, completing his education at the Victoria Institution. As his father died when Raja Petra was 22, he began to support his mother and three younger siblings by working as a rice distributor and motorcycle dealer, introducing Yamaha and other Japanese motorcycle brands to the country. In 1973 he married Marina Lee binti Abdullah, with whom he had five children. Raja Petra is a member of the Selangor royal family. He is the nephew of the late Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, the eleventh Yang di- Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia and the seventh Sultan of Selangor. His paternal grandmother Tengku Badariah was the elder sister of Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah, the second Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the eighth Sultan of Selangor. His paternal grandfather, Raja Tun Uda Al-Haj Bin Raja Muhammad, KBE (1894‚Äì1976), a distant cousin of his wife's family, was twice Menteri Besar of Selangor during the colonial era, the first Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Penang (1957‚Äì1967) and Malaysian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. His father, Raja Kamarudin bin Raja Tun Uda (1925‚Äì1971), studied law in the UK and worked for Unilever until his death. His mother, Che' Bariya Kamarudin (n√©e Barbara Mabel Parnell) (1933‚Äì1980), was Welsh.  Political involvement  Raja Petra was a leading member of Parti Keadilan Nasional (now Parti Keadilan Rakyat)‚Äîthe party set up in response to the arrest of former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim in 1998. On 11 April 2001, Raja Petra and ten other opposition activists were detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for allegedly plotting to overthrow then prime minister Mahathir bin Mohamad. He was released 52 days later. Raja Petra started the Malaysia Today website and his blog to facilitate open discussion on Malaysia's political and social scenes. In his online writings, he is often humorous and sometimes critical of the current political developments in Malaysia. He advocates for transparency, accountability and justice in the Malaysian political system. He often denounces what he sees as deeply rooted money politics, corruption, and ethnic polarisation in Malaysia. On 2 July 2008, Malaysia Today was defaced by a person known only as \\"Gasakdotnet\\", replacing the website with a superimposition of Mahathir Mohammad's face into the poster of the film We Were Soldiers accompanied by the tagline \\"My Countrymen, My Fellow Malaysians\\", alluding to Mahathir's \\"battle\\" for Malaysia as the Prime Minister from 1981 to 2003. (.) Poor internet connectivity affecting several areas in Malaysia hampered efforts to restore the website promptly.  Second ISA detention  Raja Petra filed a habeas corpus application at the High Court on 16 September 2008 seeking his release from detention under the ISA. On 22 September the Malaysian Home Minister Syed Hamid Albar signed an order to remand Raja Petra to the detention facility for up to two years under section 8 of the ISA. Ministerial orders for remand under section 8 cannot be challenged in court. Raja Petra was held without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in northern Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, followed by a two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents. Raja Petra's wife Marina Lee Abdullah said: \\"(Police) said my husband has been sent to Kamunting this morning and that he will remain there for two years with no trial. This is the worst news I can receive but we will keep fighting for his release. This is dirty foul play by the government as they know that we are in the process of fighting for his release in the court but I was expecting this. Raja Petra was detained for allegedly 'insulting Islam' and publishing articles on his website which has tarnished the country's leadership to the point of causing confusion among the people.\\" Raja Petra's lawyer sought his release in a court hearing but this was dismissed.afp.google.com, Malaysian blogger to be detained for two years: wife news.bbc.co.uk/2, Malaysia 'dissent' blogger jailedMalaysian blogger jailed for 2 years, iht.com.monstersandcritics.com, Malaysian blogger jailed for two years under security law Raja Petra's detention caused widespread protests by civil society groups, lawyers and other online commentators. Meanwhile, in Kota Kinabalu, the United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (Upko) led by its Secretary-General Datuk Wilfred Madius Tangau, joined its three other Barisan Nasional (BN) counterparts MCA, Gerakan and MIC petitioning the Government review of the ISA. Madius said the party supports former de facto Law Minister Datuk Zaid Ibrahim's position that the ISA should only be used against those who posed a threat to national security, such as terrorists: \\"Clearly in the case of Seputeh MP, Teresa Kok, Raja Petra Kamaruddin, and Sin Chew Daily reporter, Tan Hoon Cheng, there are so many other public order laws that can be used against them if, at all, there is a case to do so.\\"dailyexpress.com.my/news, Upko also wants ISA reviewed  Controversies  = Muhammad Muhammad Taib = On 23 July 2007, Tan Sri Muhammad Muhammad Taib, UMNO's Information Chief at that time, lodged a police report against Malaysia Today at 12.57 p.m. at the Tun H.S.

The Star. Raja Petra Kamarudin responded by releasing an article on Malaysia Today, lashing back on Taib with allegations of hypocrisy and corruption. A second police report against Raja Petra was believed to be lodged after the release of the article, and Raja Petra was summoned to the Dang Wangi police station on 25 July 2007 for eight hours of questioning. His wife was also questioned for an hour. After his release from questioning, Raja Petra gave his reason on why Muhammad Taib made a police report against him, stating the reason is that the government wished to silence the nations bloggers before the Malaysian general election. = Universiti Utara Malaysia = Raja Petra made headlines in end March 2008 when a Malaysian High Court ordered him in and the group chief editor and editor of PKR's organ Suara Keadilan to pay a total of RM7 million to Universiti Utara Malaysia and its vice-chancellor Tan Sri Dr Nordin Kardi for libel. = Altantuya Shaariibuu =  Accusation of Najib Abdul Razak's involvement  Raja Petra was charged on 6 May 2008 with sedition for allegedly implying that the Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak was involved in the sensational killing of a young Mongolian woman, Altantuya Shaariibuu. Also charged for sedition was businessman Syed Akbar Ali, who had allegedly posted a seditious comment on Malaysia Today. Raja Petra Raja Kamaruddin, who did not deny that he linked Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak to the slaying, pleaded innocent to the charge, and said he should have the right to hold the powerful accountable for wrongdoing. Raja Petra was taken to a detention center after he refused to post the bail of RM5,000. The court set the trial for 6 October 2008. If convicted, he faces up to 3 years in prison. \\"I am not posting bail. See you guys in October, I will be out for Christmas.

She launched a campaign to solicit donations of RM1 from the public for the RM5,000 bail, but called it off a few hours later after the campaign raised over RM35,000. Several members of parliament from the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition were present at Raja Petra's hearing, with one, Nurul Izzah Anwar, calling Malaysia Today \\"the primary source of a lot of unearthing of scandals especially corrupt practices of the leadership and the government...it has helped [open] the eyes of the nation to what is going on and what is wrong with the country. It played a huge role in the last elections.\\" On the same day, Lim Kit Siang raised the issue of Raja Petra's sedition charges in Parliament, arguing that Najib had personally intervened to ensure the Attorney-General would charge Raja Petra with sedition, and calling it an abuse of power. Raja Petra Kamaruddin's wife Marina Lee Abdullah stated that \\"He is on a hunger strike. It is a protest. The last time he did this, his liver was damaged. I don't think he is going to last that long.\\" Raja Petra also refused visits by family members.Inquirer.net, Malaysian blogger starts hunger strike in jail On his release, Raja Petra claimed that he had not, in fact, been on a hunger strike but was refusing to eat and drink for fear of being poisoned, as Chief Inspector Azilah Hadri and Cpl.

Raja Petra later distanced himself from the statutory declaration in an interview with TV3, saying his accusations linking Najib and Rosmah to the murder was repeating information passed onto him by opposition figures, rather than information he knew to be true himself. He stated that he did not genuinely believe that Rosmah was at the murder scene.

This is due to his statutory declaration connecting Deputy Prime Minister D Najib Razak's wife, Rosmah Mansor, saying she was present when Mongolian national Altantunya Shaariibuu's body was blown up. On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his statutory declaration on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu. He is alleged to have defamed Deputy Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor by making a libellous statement in the declaration which he affirmed on 18 June when he knew that it would tarnish her good name. He also faced similar charges against Kolonel Norhayati Hassan and her husband Acting Kolonel Abdul Aziz Buyong. The trial of Raja Petra, who has been charged with defaming Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor and her two assistants, will begin in the Sessions Court on 26 May 2009. Raja Petra had sought an order from the High Court to refer the matter to the Federal Court on a constitutional point or to return the case to the magistrate's court for trial. = Shafee Vs RPK = Prominent Malaysian Lawyer Datuk Seri Shafee Abdullah had filed suit against Raja Petra in August 2008 for RPK's posting on 6, 7 and 11 August of that year where three articles titled \\"Shafee Abdullah: Sodomologist Extraordinaire\\", \\"Money, Power and Sex: What Motivates Man\\" and \\"The Real Dalang Behind The Anwar Sodomy Allegation\\" was clear defamation against Shafee. RPK had in reply, filed a statement of defence on 25 November 2008 denying that the three articles were false, malicious or defamatory of Shafee.

The new Dutch Republic was the most prosperous nation in Europe and led European trade, science, and art. The northern Netherlandish provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself. The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up. Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of Baroque painting, and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including that of neighbouring Flanders. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed realism inherited from Early Netherlandish painting. Frans Hals' tronie, with the later title Gypsy Girl. 1628‚Äì30. Oil on wood, . The tronie includes elements of portraiture, genre painting, and sometimes history painting. The Blinding of Samson, 1636, which Rembrandt gave to Huyghens A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct genres of paintings,Confusingly, one particular genre of painting is called genre painting, the painting of some kind of everyday scenes with unidentified people. But, for example, still-life is also a genre in painting. with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the French invasion of 1672 is the core of Golden Age painting. Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories. Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development. Types of painting Paulus Potter, The Bull (1647); 3.4 metres wide. An unusually monumental animal painting that challenges the hierarchy of genres. A distinctive feature of the period, compared to earlier European painting, was the limited number of religious paintings. Dutch Calvinism forbade religious paintings in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and still lifes of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists. The widely held theory of the \\"hierarchy of genres\\" in painting, whereby some types were regarded as more prestigious than others, led many painters to want to produce history painting. However this was the hardest to sell, as even Rembrandt found. Many were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. In descending order of status, the categories in the hierarchy were: *history painting, including allegories and popular religious subjects. *Portrait painting, including the tronie *genre painting or scenes of everyday life *landscape, including seascapes, battlescenes, cityscapes, and ruins (landscapists were the \\"common footmen in the Army of Art\\" according to Samuel van Hoogstraten.Fuchs, 104) *still life The Dutch concentrated heavily on the \\"lower\\" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy.Franits, 2-3 Most paintings were relatively small ‚Äì the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating, fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface, many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from printmaking. In turn, the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century ‚Äì poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in tomb monuments and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and ceramics. Painted delftware tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the auricular style, led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking. The art world Dirck Hals, genre scene of Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also here. Foreigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold ‚Äì it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.Lloyd, 15, citing Jonathan Israel. Perhaps only 1% survive today, and \\"only about 10% of these were of real quality\\". The volume of production meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods, there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists.Franits, 2 Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who had fallen out of fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as Vermeer, Frans Hals and Rembrandt in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.Jan Steen was an innkeeper, Aelbert Cuyp was one of many whose wealthy wives persuaded them to give up painting, although Karel Dujardin seems to have run away from his to continue his work. Conversely Jan van de Cappelle came from a very wealthy family, and Joachim Wtewael was a self-made flax tycoon. See their biographies in MacLaren. The fish artist Jacob Gillig also worked as a warder in the Utrecht prison, conveniently close to the fish market. Bankrupts included: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan de Bray, and many others.

The distribution of pictures was very wide: \\"yea many tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers etts., will have some picture or other by their Forge and in their stalle. Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting\\" reported an English traveller in 1640.Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this \\"oft-quoted\\" remark \\"undoubtedly exaggerated\\". There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like Vermeer and his father, Jan van Goyen and Willem Kalf. Rembrandt's dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh and his son Gerrit were among the most important. Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the \\"common footmen in the Army of Art\\" according to Samuel van Hoogstraten.Fuchs, 104 The Haarlem Painter's Guild in 1675, by Jan de Bray, whose self-portrait is the second from the left The technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master. Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations. The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the Guild of Saint Luke. In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting. Several new guilds were established in the period: Amsterdam in 1579, Haarlem in 1590, and Gouda, Rotterdam, Utrecht and Delft between 1609 and 1611.Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241 The Leiden authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.Prak (2008), 153 Later in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no longer worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with academies, often only concerned with the training of artists. The Hague, with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the Confrerie Pictura. With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done \\"speculatively\\" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries ‚Äì one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.Fuchs, 43 Aert de Gelder, Self-portrait as Zeuxis (1685) There were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the University of Leiden for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories Cities such as Haarlem and Utrecht were more important in the first half of the century, with Leiden and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as Flanders and Germany.Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260 Dutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.Fuchs, 76 As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are Karel van Mander (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and Arnold Houbraken (De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen ‚Äì \\"The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters\\", 1718‚Äì21). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, Vasari in including a great number of short lives of artists ‚Äì over 500 in Houbraken's case ‚Äì and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters. The German artist Joachim von Sandrart (1606‚Äì1688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his Deutsche Akademie in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was Samuel van Hoogstraten (1627‚Äì1678), whose Zichtbare wereld and Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere History painting Jacob van Loo, Dana√´ (compare Rembrandt's treatment) This category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and allegorical scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.Fuchs, 107 Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of Mannerist allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the Dutch Revolt, which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, Dutch Painting, \\"Prologue\\" pp. 27‚Äì43, 1945, Faber, London History painting was now a \\"minority art\\", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjectsFuchs, 62-3 More than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of Caravaggio. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the Bentvueghels club in Rome. Utrecht Caravaggism: Dirck van Baburen, Christ crowned with thorns, 1623, for a convent in Utrecht, not a market available in most of Holland. In the early part of the century many Northern Mannerist artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of Abraham Bloemaert and Joachim Wtewael.Slive, 13-14 Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) Adam Elsheimer as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like Pieter Lastman, Rembrandt's master, and Jan and Jacob Pynas. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the \\"Pre- Rembrandtists\\", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.Fuchs, 62-69 Utrecht Caravaggism describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of chiaroscuro. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, Paulus Bor, Jacob van Velsen, plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage. Jacob Jordaens was among Flemish Protestant artists. The leading artists were Hendrick ter Brugghen, Gerard van Honthorst and Dirck van Baburen, and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.Slive, 22-4 Rembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his etchings are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.Fuchs, 69-77 Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; Govaert Flinck was the most successful. Gerard de Lairesse (1640‚Äì1711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.Fuchs, 77-78 Nudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or \\"Italian\\" peasants. Portraits Bartholomeus van der Helst, Sophia Trip (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.Trip family tree. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous. Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228). Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: \\"artists travel along this road without delight\\", according to van Mander.Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33 While Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting en masse, as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Frans Hals, Willem Heythuijsen (1634), . Jan Mijtens, family portrait, 1652, with the boys in \\"picturesque\\" dress. The other great portraitist of the period is Frans Hals, whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely \\"nonchalant pose\\" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: \\"no other portrait from this period is so informal\\".Ekkart, 118 The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.Ekkart, 130 and 114. Jan de Bray encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. Thomas de Keyser, Bartholomeus van der Helst, Ferdinand Bol and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists. From what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69 Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68 As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73 Lace and ruff collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71 At the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as \\"picturesque\\" or \\"Roman\\" dress.Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73 Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display. A distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the tronie. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. Jan Lievens and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre. Family portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood. Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's schutterij or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. Rembrandt's Syndics of the Drapers' Guild is a subtle treatment of a group round a table. The Meagre Company, an Amsterdam militia group portrait or schutterstuk by Frans Hals and Pieter Codde (1633-37) Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of M√ºnster, 1648; 5.47 metres wide Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632, Mauritshuis, The Hague). Boards of trustees in their regentenstuk portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces. Most militia group portraits were commissioned in Haarlem and Amsterdam, and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger. Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition. Rembrandt's famous The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq better known as the Night Watch (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works. The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the Amsterdams Historisch Museum; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands. Scenes of everyday life A typical Jan Steen picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.Another version at Apsley House, with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9 Genre paintings show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached ‚Äì they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's The Milkmaid; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. There were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, \\"merry company\\" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to \\"genre painting\\" ‚Äì until the late 18th century the English often called them \\"drolleries\\".Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123 Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.Slive, 123 Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size. Though genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction. Typically they show what art historians term a \\"reality effect\\" rather than an actual realist depiction; the degree to which this is the case varies between artists. Many paintings which seem only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message ‚Äì the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation ‚Äì the works of Jan Steen, whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which Svetlana Alpers' The Art of Describing (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24 Gerrit van Honthorst (1625), punning visually on the lute in this brothel scene The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between \\"taverns\\" or \\"inns\\" and \\"brothels\\", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: \\"Inn in front; brothel behind\\" was a Dutch proverb.On Diderot's Art Criticism. Mira Friedman, p. 36 The Steen above is very clearly an exemplum, and though each of the individual components of it is realistically depicted, the overall scene is not a plausible depiction of a real moment; typically of genre painting, it is a situation that is depicted, and satirized.Fuchs, 39-42, analyses two comparable scenes by Steen and Dou, and p. 46. The Renaissance tradition of recondite emblem books had, in the hands of the 17th-century Dutch ‚Äì almost universally literate in the vernacular, but mostly without education in the classics ‚Äì turned into the popularist and highly moralistic works of Jacob Cats, Roemer Visscher, and others, often based in popular proverbs. The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch slang terms in the sexual area: the vagina could be represented by a lute (luit) or stocking (kous), and sex by a bird (vogelen), among many other options,Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45. and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side. Adriaen van Ostade, Peasants in an Interior (1661) The same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work ‚Äì they massively outnumber similar treatments of men. Working-class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.Slive, 191 Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.Slive, 1 This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of The Milkmaid (Vermeer), claimed by different art historians for each tradition. and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following. The tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The Haarlem painters Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech, Frans Hals and Esaias van de Velde were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted \\"merry companies\\" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. Gabriel Metsu, The Hunter's Gift, c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of Cupid presides over the scene. Van de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.Franits, 24-27 A stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes Adriaen Brouwer, from 1625 or 1626, gave Adriaen van Ostade his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting. Van Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, Judith Leyster (1609‚Äì1660), specialized in these, before her husband, Jan Miense Molenaer, prevailed on her to give up painting. The Leiden school of fijnschilder (\\"fine painters\\") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included Gerard Dou, Gabriel Metsu, Frans van Mieris the Elder, and later his son Willem van Mieris, Godfried Schalcken, and Adriaen van der Werff. This later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.Fuchs, 80 Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included Nicolaes Maes, Gerard ter Borch and Pieter de Hooch, whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with Jan Vermeer, long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.

Landscapes and cityscapes Esaias van de Velde, Winter Landscape (1623) Landscape painting was a major genre in the 17th century. Flemish landscapes (particularly from Antwerp) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier Netherlandish landscape painting in the \\"world landscape\\" tradition of Joachim Patinir, Herri met de Bles and the early Pieter Bruegel the Elder. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations. Important early figures in the move to realism were Esaias van de Velde (1587‚Äì1630) and Hendrick Avercamp (1585‚Äì1634), both also mentioned above as genre painters ‚Äì in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the \\"tonal phase\\" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were Jan van Goyen (1596‚Äì1656), Salomon van Ruysdael (1602‚Äì1670), Pieter de Molyn (1595‚Äì1661), and in marine painting Simon de Vlieger (1601‚Äì1653), with a host of minor figures ‚Äì a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.Slive, 189 ‚Äì the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991) Jacob van Ruisdael, The Windmill at Wijk (1670) Aelbert Cuyp, River landscape with Riders (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings. From the 1650s the \\"classical phase\\" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single \\"heroic tree\\", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202 The leading artist was Jacob van Ruisdael (1628‚Äì1682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced \\"Nordic\\" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.Derived from works by Allart van Everdingen who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203 His pupil was Meindert Hobbema (1638‚Äì1709), best known for his atypical Avenue at Middelharnis (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were Aelbert Cuyp (1620‚Äì1691) and Philips Koninck (1619‚Äì1688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky. A different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean staffage and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. Jan Both (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with Claude Lorrain, was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were Nicolaes Berchem (1620‚Äì1683) and Adam Pijnacker. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.Slive, 225 A number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from Hercules Seghers (c. 1589‚Äìc. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive ‚Äì how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear. Aert van der Neer (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow. Landscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, Paulus Potter (1625‚Äì1654), Albert Jansz. Klomp (1625-1688), Adriaen van de Velde (1636‚Äì1672) and Karel Dujardin (1626‚Äì1678, farm animals), with Philips Wouwerman painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's The Young Bull is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages. Pieter Jansz Saenredam, Assendelft Church, 1649, with the gravestone of his father in the foreground. Architecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by Dirck van Delen. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of perspective grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors. Pieter Jansz Saenredam, whose father Jan Saenredam engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of Emanuel de Witte, who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam. Gerard Houckgeest, followed by van Witte and Hendrick van Vliet, had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.Slive, 268-273 Gerrit Berckheyde specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; Jan van der Heyden preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.Slive, 273-6 File:View of Haarlem from the Dunes at Overeen - Date unknown.jpgJacob van Ruisdael, View of Haarlem; Ruisdael is a central figure, with more varied subjects than many landscapists.

Maritime painting Salomon van Ruisdael, typical View of Deventer Seen from the North-West (1657); an example of the \\"tonal phase\\". The Dutch Republic relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of maritime painting was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.Slive, 213-216 Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a Dutch navy at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.Franits, 1 More often than not, even small ships fly the Dutch tricolour, and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of Salomon van Ruysdael with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of Aelbert Cuyp, where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels and Abraham Storck. Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born Ludolf Bakhuizen, as the leading artist.Slive, 213-224 Still lifes Pieter Claesz, Vanitas (1630) Still lifes were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters. Several types of subject were recognised: banketje were \\"banquet pieces\\", ontbijtjes simpler \\"breakfast pieces\\".MacLaren, 79 Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life ‚Äì this is known as the vanitas theme ‚Äì implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109 Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century. Abraham van Beijeren (c. 1660); \\"ostentatious\\" still life. Initially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century pronkstillevens (\\"ostentatious still lifes\\"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as Frans Snyders and Adriaen van Utrecht, became more popular.Pronkstilleven in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.Fuchs, 113-6 Willem Claeszoon Heda (1595‚Äìc. 1680) and Willem Kalf (1619‚Äì1693) led the change to the pronkstilleven, while Pieter Claesz (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler \\"ontbijt\\" (\\"breakfast pieces\\"), or explicit vanitas pieces. In all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606‚Äì1684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in Antwerp. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem. Jacob Gillig, Freshwater Fish (1684) Flower paintings formed a sub- group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as Maria van Oosterwyck and Rachel Ruysch.and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster. The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time ‚Äì even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in delftware tulip-holders.Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms. The Dutch tradition was largely begun by Ambrosius Bosschaert (1573‚Äì1621), a Flemish- born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of Willem van Aelst (1627‚Äì1683). Painters from Leiden, The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre. Dead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet ‚Äì Abraham van Beijeren did many of these.Slive, 287-291 The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting ‚Äì they would have been considered prideful in portraits ‚Äì and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen ‚Äì Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.

Foreign lands Frans Post, scene in Dutch Brazil; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost. For Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's Schilderboeck was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so. However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage. Many Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; printmaking was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The Dutch Gift to Charles II of England was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir Peter Lely followed by Sir Godfrey Kneller, developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish Anthony van Dyck before the English Civil War. The marine painters van der Velde, father and son, were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as Hendrick Danckerts. The Bamboccianti were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy. Jan Weenix and Melchior d'Hondecoeter specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge overdoors across Northern Europe. Although the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of Dutch Brazil turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.R√ºdger Joppien. \\"The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists,\\" in Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil, ed. Ernst van den Boogaart, et al. 297-376. The Hague: Johan Maurits van Nassau Stichting, 1979. The two most well known of these artists were Frans Post, a landscapist, and a still life painter, Albert Eckhout, who produced ethnographic paintings of Brazil's population. These were originally displayed in the Great Hall of the Vrijburg Palace in Recife.van Groesen, Amsterdam's Atlantic, pp. 171-72. With the Portuguese replacementr of the Dutch, Maurits gave the Vrijburg Palace paintings to Frederick III of Denmark There was a market in Amsterdam for such paintings,Michiel van Groesen, Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 2017, pp. 150-51. and Post continued to produce Brazilian scenes for years after his return to the Netherlands. The Dutch East Indies were covered much less well artistically.

The enormous success of 17th-century Dutch painting overpowered the work of subsequent generations, and no Dutch painter of the 18th century‚Äînor, arguably, a 19th-century one before Van Gogh‚Äîis well known outside the Netherlands. Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists. If only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of Old Master paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in Dresden and over 50 in the Hermitage.Slive, 212 But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for Rembrandt, especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden fijnschilders had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and passim, and listings for individual artists Vermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others. However the fact that so many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates that the quality of individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown.See Reitlinger, 483-4, and passim Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of Adriaen Coorte in the 1950s,Slive, 319 and the landscapists Jacobus Mancaden and Frans Post earlier in the century.Slive, 191-2 Gerard ter Borch, Paternal Admonition, or Brothel Scene (c. 1654; Amsterdam version). Genre paintings were long popular, but little- regarded. In 1780 Horace Walpole disapproved that they \\"invite laughter to divert itself with the nastiest indelicacy of boors\\".\\"Advertisement\\" or Preface to Vol. 4 of the 2nd edition of Anecdotes of Painting in England, based on George Vertue's notebooks, page ix, 1782, J. Dodwell, London, Internet Archive Sir Joshua Reynolds, the English leader of 18th-century academic art, made several revealing comments on Dutch art. He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's Milkmaid (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the \\"patience\\" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the High Renaissance, so that his talent could have been put to better use.Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen) By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called Paternal Admonition, as it was then known, by Gerard ter Borch. This was praised by Goethe and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel ‚Äì there are two versions (Berlin & Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a \\"tell-tale coin\\" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title Brothel Scene. Franits, 146-7, citing Alison Kettering, says there is \\"deliberate vagueness\\" as to the subject, and still uses the title Paternal Admonition. In the second half of the 18th century, the down to earth realism of Dutch painting was a \\"Whig taste\\" in England, and in France associated with Enlightenment rationalism and aspirations for political reform.Reitlinger, I, 11-15. Quote p.13 In the 19th century, with a near-universal respect for realism, and the final decline of the hierarchy of genres, contemporary painters began to borrow from genre painters both their realism and their use of objects for narrative purposes, and paint similar subjects themselves, with all the genres the Dutch had pioneered appearing on far larger canvases (still lifes excepted). In landscape painting, the Italianate artists were the most influential and highly regarded in the 18th century, but John Constable was among those Romantics who denounced them for artificiality, preferring the tonal and classical artists. In fact both groups remained influential and popular in the 19th century.

It operates as a transnational party at the European level (European political party), according to Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003.http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2003R2004:20071227:EN:PDF It incorporates members from both the centre-left and the centre-right of the political spectrum. The party was set up under Danish law on 7 November 2005 and founded as a European Party in Brussels on 8 November 2005. Its first congress was held on 24 February 2006. Former Danish MEPs Jens-Peter Bonde and Hanne Dahl inspired the EUD‚Äôs creation and first years. In January 2009, Swedish economist and former MEP S√∂ren Wibe succeeded Bonde as President of the EUD. Following Wibe's sudden death in December 2010, former Irish Green MEP Patricia McKenna was named president of the EUD and Lave Knud Broch from People's Movement against the EU as vice president. The EUD‚Äôs platform is not concerned with matters of right or left wing ideology because it believes that such issues are best considered by national and regional parliaments under their citizens‚Äô democratic control. It is committed to enhancing transparency, subsidiarity, diversity and most importantly budget control in the European Union. In 2009, four of its affiliated MEPs were members of the Independence and Democracy group in the European Parliament. Also, two affiliated MEPs - Roger Helmer and Daniel Hannan, both British Conservatives - sat as independents. Hannan left EUD in October 2009 to join the newly formed Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists, while Helmer defected from the British Conservatives to British party UKIP. From 2010 to 2014 EUD had one member in the European Parliament: Rina Ronja Kari (replaced S√∏ren S√∏ndergaard 5 February 2014), who sits as an associate member of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left Group. In the 2014 European Parliament elections two EUD members Rina Ronja Kari and Iveta Grigule were elected. Ten members of national and regional parliaments from ten countries are also members of the EUD.(2014)  Political platform  The political aim of the EUDemocrats is to reform the present structures of the European Union. According to its political platform,EUD Political Platform http://www.eudemocrats.org/eud/content.php?id=18 the EUD believes that decisions should be made at the lowest possible level (subsidiarity), thus giving an effective voice to the citizens of member states, regions and national minorities. It aims to unite those who are critical of the EU for its undemocratic development and its ever-more centralising political features. The EUD is opposed to the centralisation of political power in EU institutions, and demands democratic scrutiny and control over EU institutional powers and actions by national and regional assemblies. Its four political core objectives are: *enhancing transparency on all political levels, especially in the EU by giving citizens insight into all documents and meetings; *strengthen real subsidiarity in the EU thus taking decisions at the lowest political level possible; *improving democracy and accountability by reforming EU institutions and structures making them function more democratically; *defending diversity in the EU by making it possible for member states to implement politics according to their national reality and by promoting flexible cooperation instead of fixed harmonisation. The operational aim of EUD is to act as an effective political platform and campaigning organisation which is able to influence pan-European politics towards extending democratic structures in the EU. The EUD also seeks to have candidates elected in European elections from both center-right and center- left that share its core eurorealist political ideas and thus influence politics in the European Parliament itself.

After completing his studies he became Privatdozent at Jena. In 1877 he was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Groningen. He published editions of many Latin authors, including Catullus, Propertius and minor poets. His son Wilhelm Baehrens also became a classical scholar. Life Baehrens was the son of Paul Baehrens, a businessman, and his wife Maria (n√©e Hagen). After the death of his father (1850), his mother married Dr. G. A. Hesse, who became like a second father to Baehrens. He was originally supposed to become a businessman, but in accordance with his aptitude Baehrens attended the Friedrich-Wilhelm- Gymnasium in Cologne. And after his final exam, he began his studies in classical philology at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn. His teachers included Jacob Bernays, Franz B√ºcheler, Friedrich Heimsoeth, Joseph Klein, August Reifferscheid, Franz Ritter, and Anton Springer. Most influential on Baehrens was Lucian M√ºller, as well as Otto Jahn and Hermann Usener, who gave him metrical and paleographical exercises, which brought him in 1868 to the Philological Seminar. In 1870 Baehrens took the \\"Oberlehrerexamen\\" and earned his doctorate. From 1871 to 1872 his deepened his studies at the University of Leipzig with the critic Friedrich Ritschl. Finally, he undertook his first educational trip, where he saw antique manuscripts in Munich, Milan, Bologna, Pisa, Venedig, Florence, Lucca, Siena, Rome, and Naples. In Rome he stayed six months at the Deutsches Archaeologisches Institut, where he gained many contacts. After his return in the autumn of 1873 Baehrens qualified as a professor at the Friedrich- Schiller-Universit√§t Jena with the article \\"De Sulpiciae quae vocatur satira, commentatio philologica.\\" In the following years he took further research trips: from January to April 1874 he visited the libraries of L√∂wen, Br√ºssel, and Paris, and from March to August 1875, Paris, London, and Oxford. In the summer semester of 1877 he was given the position of professor, and spent several years as a professor at the University of Groningen In the next eleven years he held many lectures and visited the library in London once again. In Groningen he married the daughter of his colleague Willem Hecker, a professor of history. On September 26 he succumbed to an abscess of the brain after 26 days. One of his three surviving children, Wilhelm Baehrens became a classical philologist. During his research, Emil Baehrens brought forth many important editions of different Latin authors, including Catullus (\\"Catulli Veronensis liber\\", 1876, with a large commentary published as second volume in 1885), \\"Panegyrici Latini,\\" Gaius Valerius Flaccus (\\"C. Valeri Flacci Setini Balbi Argonauticon libri octo\\"), Publius Papinius Statius (\\"Silvae\\"), Tibullus (\\"Tibullinische Bl√§tter\\"), Sextus Propertius, Horace (\\"Lectiones Hortianae\\"), Tacitus (Dialogus de oratoribus\\"), and Minucius Felix (\\"Octavius\\"). His greatest undertaking were the \\"Poetae latini minores,\\" which from 1879 until 1883 appeared in five volumes from the publisher Teubner-Verlag. They were newly edited by Friedrich Karl Vollmer from 1910 until 1923. The first edition appeared in 1930 as a new adaptation by Willy Morel. As a continuation of the collection Baehrens published in 1886 through the Teubner-Berlag the \\"Fragmenta poetarum Romanorum,\\" which are today separated from the \\"Fragmenta poetarum Latinorum\\" by Willy Morel, Karl B√ºchner, and J√ºrgen Bl√§nsdorf.

The founders of the family's fortunes were al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra (c. 632 ‚Äì 702) and his son Yazid ibn al-Muhallab (672‚Äì720), governor of Khurasan and Iraq, who led an unsuccessful anti-Umayyad rebellion in Basra in 720. Despite his defeat and death, the family remained influential in their power base of Basra, and at the time of the Abbasid Revolution they rose up in their support. Despite the support of some Muhallabids to the abortive Alid revolt of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, the new Abbasid regime rewarded their support with governorships at Basra ad the Ahwaz, but most prominently in Ifriqiya, where the family ruled in uninterrupted succession from 768 to 795. Ifriqiya under their rule enjoyed a period of prosperity, above all agriculture was reinvigorated by the expansion of irrigation systems. The Muhallabids of Ifriqiya enjoyed a great deal of autonomy and were able to maintain Arab rule in the face of revolts by the Berbers. They were unable however to prevent the formation of the kingdoms of the Idrisids in Morocco and the Rustamids in central Algeria. The family fell from power during and after the Fourth Fitna, when the traditional Arab families began to be increasingly sidelined by Caliph al-Ma'mun's Turkish and Iranian generals. One of the few members of the family who rose to prominence after that was Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Muhallabi, the capable vizier of the 10th-century Buyid emir Mu'izz al-Dawla.

Her father was a writer himself and appeared in a number of radio plays as well as broadcasting commentaries on Newcastle United games. Her mother, Norah Smiles, was the daughter of Lucy Dorling (a half-sister of Isabella Beeton) and William Holmes Smiles (son of Samuel Smiles).Rose Collis, ‚ÄòSpain, Nancy Brooker (1917‚Äì1964)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 26 March 2013 As a child, Spain remembered pushing the future eminent journalist William Hardcastle into the Bull Park Lake on the Town Moor, where she used to learn to ride at five shillings an hour \\"with other little bourgeois tots\\". Spain went to Roedean School (a family tradition) from 1931 to 1935, where she began wearing \\"mannish\\" clothes, and developed the speaking voice which stood her in such good stead in her eventual media career. She played lacrosse for Northumberland and Durham, and hockey for the North of England, as well as playing tennis and cricket. She also acted on BBC radio, where she took over the star parts vacated by Esther McCracken. She was a sports reporter for the Newcastle Journal, and had a love affair with local sportswoman Winifrid Sargeant. During the Second World War, Spain served in the WRNS on Tyneside, a period covered in her book Thank you, Nelson (1945). She served as a driver and was then commissioned, and worked in the WRNS press office in London. Post-war career After the war, Spain published several books, including a series of detective novels set at a girls school, Radcliff Hall, based on Roedean (the name a presumed allusion to Radclyffe Hall, and probably also to Lord Berners' novel The Girls of Radcliff Hall). This helped her become a star columnist for the Daily Express, She and the News of the World in the 1950s and 1960s, and made many radio broadcasts, particularly on Woman's Hour and My Word!. She later appeared as a panellist on BBC TV's record review programme Juke Box Jury and the panel game What's My Line?. Her column-writing caused the Daily Express to be sued successfully for libel - twice - by Evelyn Waugh.Sykes, Christopher. Evelyn Waugh: a biography. Collins, 1975. As well as Spain's books of memoirs, including Why I'm Not a Millionaire (1956), she wrote a biography of her great aunt, Isabella Beeton (original author of the encyclopaedic Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management), and a series of detective novels.Patricia Craig and Mary Cadogan, The Lady Investigates, Oxford (1981) p.109 Rose Collis wrote a posthumous biography of the broadcaster and journalist in 1997. Private life Often in the news and tempted to marry to seem respectable - Spain's name was linked with that of Gilbert Harding - she lived openly with the editor of She, Joan Werner Laurie (Jonny), and was a friend of the famous, including No√´l Coward and Marlene Dietrich. She and Laurie were regulars at the Gateways club in Chelsea, London, and were widely known to be lesbians. Spain and Laurie lived in an extended household with the rally driver Sheila van Damm, and their sons Nicholas (born 1946) and Thomas (born in 1952). Nicholas was Laurie's son; Thomas was also described as Laurie's youngest son, but may have been Spain's son after an affair with Philip Youngman Carter, husband of Margery Allingham. Spain died, with Laurie and three others, on 21 March 1964. They were flying in a Piper Apache aeroplane which crashed near Aintree racecourse, near Liverpool, killing all on board. The aircraft (G-ASHC) had taken off from Luton Airport and was on approach to land at the racecourse. Spain was travelling there to cover the 1964 Grand National, which was taking place that day. She was cremated with Laurie at Golders Green Crematorium, London, and her ashes were put in the family grave in Horsley, Northumberland. Coward summed up in his diary: \\"It is cruel that all that gaiety, intelligence and vitality should be snuffed out when so many bores and horrors are left living.\\" She is also the inspiration of the famous song 'Nancy Spain' written by Barney Rushe and made famous by, among others, Christy Moore.

He quickly became a household name as a result of his slow and distinctive West Country speech style, which in turn also made him popular with impersonators. He returned to television with Arthur Negus Enjoys (1982) and, especially, Antiques Roadshow (1979‚Äì1983). He was mentioned in the 1970 Monty Python \\"Election Night Special\\" sketch, and again two episodes later in the sketch \\"Archaeology Today\\".

Family and early life He was born in Dublin in 1917. He was the son of Cathal Brugha, who was Minister for Defence in the first D√°il and was killed in 1922, during the Civil War; his mother Caitl√≠n Brugha (n√©e Kingston) was an anti-Treaty TD from 1923 to 1927. The family home, a refuge for republicans, was often raided by the successive authorities whom the Brughas opposed: first the Royal Irish Constabulary, then British soldiers and Auxiliaries, followed by the forces of the Irish Free State. Brugha was educated at Rockwell College and in Col√°iste Mhuire, and joined the IRA at the age of 16. When IRA members were interned at the outbreak of World War II, he went on the run. He was eventually arrested in 1940, and interned at the Curragh for the duration of The Emergency. While on parole for health reasons he met M√°ire MacSwiney, the only child of Lord Mayor of Cork Terence MacSwiney who died while on hunger strike in 1920, and they married in Cork in July 1945. Brugha then joined the business which his mother had established, the menswear shop Kingstons Ltd, eventually becoming managing director. Political career Released from detention, he began to rethink his relationship with republicanism. Talking in 1968, to Tim Pat Coogan for his book The IRA, Brugha described his eventual rejection of the IRA's doctrine of the continued legitimacy of the second D√°il, saying: \\"We became the victims of an illusion that could never become a reality\\" and that \\"it was obvious to me that the 26 counties were politically free and that the sort of activity in which the IRA had been engaged had not helped to end Partition.\\" Ruair√≠ and M√°ire both joined Clann na Poblachta shortly after its foundation in 1946, and at the 1948 general election, he stood in the Waterford constituency which his mother had represented in the 1920s. However, the election was a disappointment for the new party, which won only ten seats, and with less than 5% of the first-preference votes, Brugha did not win a seat. Despite differences with Clann na Poblachta leader Se√°n MacBride -- particularly over MacBride's antagonism to Fianna F√°il -- he remained on the party executive during the 1950s. In 1962, he joined Fianna F√°il, and at the 1969 general election, Brugha stood unsuccessfully as a Fianna F√°il candidate in Dublin County South. He was then elected to the 12th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel, and at the 1973 general election, he won a seat in D√°il, replacing his former Fianna F√°il running mate Kevin Boland, who stood for his new Aontacht √âireann party. After that election, Fine Gael and Labour formed the National Coalition government, and Fianna F√°il went into opposition for the first time in 16 years. In 1974, Jack Lynch appointed Brugha as Fianna F√°il Spokesman on Northern Ireland, where he helped reshape the party's policy and supported the Cosgrave government over the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement. After boundary changes, he lost his D√°il seat at the 1977 general election, to his party colleague, Niall Andrews. However, he was elected instead to the 14th Seanad, again on the Industrial and Commercial Panel. On the recommendation of John Hume, he was also appointed as an MEP, serving until the first direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, when he stood unsuccessfully in the Dublin constituency. He was also active in the European Movement Ireland into his late eighties, serving as an honorary president of the organisation. Brugha did not contest the 1981 or February 1982 general elections, but at the November 1982 election he stood in Dublin South, where he polled less than 3% of the first-preference votes, and did not stand for election again. Death He died in Dublin on 31 January 2006, at the age of 88. On his death Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said Ruair√≠ Brugha was \\"a man of firm convictions who was passionate about politics and had a deep patriotic concern for the welfare of this country\\". He was survived by four children: Deirdre, Cathal, Traolach and Ruair√≠. His wife, M√°ire, died on 20 May 2012, aged 93. In 2006, M√°ire's memoir History's Daughter: A Memoir from the Only Child of Terence MacSwiney was published by O'Brien Press. It includes a detailed account of her husband's life, before and after their marriage.

Autosaving is typically done either in predetermined intervals or before, during, and after a complex editing task is begun.  Application software  It has traditionally been seen as a feature to protect documents in an application or system failure (crash), and autosave backups are often purged whenever the user finishes their work. An alternative paradigm is to have all changes saved continuously (as with pen and paper) and all versions of a document available for review. This would remove the need for saving documents entirely.Engadget, entelligence, There are challenges to implementation at the file, application and operating system levels.Arrow of time (blog) For example, in Microsoft Office, this option is called AutoRecover and, by default, saves the document every ten minutes in the temporary file directory. Restarting an Office program after crashing prompts the user to save the last recovered version. However, this does not protect users who mistakenly click \\"No\\" when asked to save their changes if Excel closes normally (except for Office 2013 and later). Autosave also syncs documents to OneDrive when editing normally. Mac OS 10.7 Lion added an autosave feature that is available to some applications, and works in conjunction with Time Machine-like functionality to periodically save all versions of a document. This eliminates the need for any manual saving, as well as providing versioning support through the same system. A version is saved every five minutes, during any extended periods of idle time, or when the user uses \\"Save a version,\\" which replaces the former \\"Save\\" menu item and takes its Command-S shortcut. Saves are made on snapshots of the document data and occur in a separate thread, so the user is never paused during this process.\\"Auto Save and Versions ‚Äì Every edit, every rewrite. Saved.\\" ,. Apple Inc Retrieved June 6, 2011. Applications need to be updated to take advantage of this functionality, and a number of Apple's built-in programs were updated with the release. Autosave cannot be disabled in Lion. One of the first implementation of this feature appears in the text editor Elvis.  Video games  Autosave is common in video games. Many video games have an autosave feature that saves progress during a session. For example, in an adventure game, it may autosave after completing a level or mission, or in fighting games, it might save after winning a match. Such points are called savepoints; sometimes the distinction from a checkpoint is blurred. Some games use autosave as the only method of saving data, and the player must complete a set amount of the game before saving takes place. Still another use of autosaving is as an anti-cheating device; for example in all MegaMan Battle Network games (except the first), the chip trader machines autosave upon giving out a new battle chip so the player can't cheat by soft resetting after each try of the chip trader until the desired chip is received.

Biography Foster was born March 4, 1815 in Petersham, Massachusetts where his father, Festus Foster was a minister. When Festus quit the ministry in 1818, the family moved to Brimfield, Massachusetts. Wells was educated locally, spent a year at Wilbraham Academy and then entered Wesleyan University in 1831.Hyde (1879) After graduating with honors in 1834, he studied law in Zanesville, Ohio and was admitted to the bar.Chicago Daily Tribune In 1837 the Ohio legislature authorized a geological survey of the state to be led by William W. Mather. Foster had studied under Mather at Wesleyan, and accepted an invitation to join the survey. Foster was assigned to a district in the central part of the state and mapped the area's basic stratigraphy. In particular he noted the area held extensive coal reserves. He also discovered the fossilized bones of mastodons and a species of giant beaver which he named Castoroides ohioensis.Merrill (1924) The survey lasted only eighteen months but made significant contributions towards understanding the basic geological structure of the state.Hansen (1979) When the survey ended, Foster continued to investigate the Ohio coal fields on behalf of several mining companies. In 1847 Foster and Josiah Dwight Whitney were hired to assist Charles T. Jackson in making a federal survey of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which was about to become a major copper and iron mining region. The survey was poorly managed by Jackson and when he was dismissed, Foster and Whitney were asked to complete the effort. The final reports were published under their names in 1850 and 1851.Merrill (1924) In 1851 they made a well-received presentation of their findings to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Afterwards Foster returned to Brimfield and became involved in politics. He was a prominent member of the Know-Nothing movement, an organization opposed to immigrants and Catholics. When the party split over the question of slavery, Foster worked with Henry Wilson, a noted abolitionist, to organize the Republican party in Massachusetts. In 1855 Foster ran for Congress as a Republican and was narrowly defeated by Calvin C. Chaffee. In 1858 he settled in Chicago where he remained for the rest of his life. For a time he worked in the land department of the Illinois Central Railroad but then joined the faculty at the Old University of Chicago where he served as a professor of natural history. Foster had been interested in archaeology since his work on the Ohio geological survey and spent many years studying the remnants of the Indian mound builders culture. Just prior to his death in 1873, he published Prehistoric races of the United States of America which laid out the results of his studies of the mound builders. Foster was elected president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1869 and served for three years as president of the Chicago Academy of Sciences. He died on June 29, 1873 of inflammation of the liver.

Lovers' lanes have existed for centuries, sometimes as places for secret meetings with a forbidden lover or as a euphemism for red-light districts and other areas of prostitution.

Crime Due to the typically isolated location of most lovers' lanes, they have occasionally been the setting for violent crime.

Biography Stanton was born in Painesville, Ohio. His father, Francis Michael Stanton, was a World War I veteran who lived for many years in Cleveland, Ohio in the house next door to Jerry Siegal, the creator of Superman. Stanton's mother, Mary Callinan Stanton, was the daughter of Delia Sexton Callinan, an Irish immigrant, who worked as an upstairs maid in the wealthy suburb of Bratenahl. His grandfather on his mother's side was Matthew Callinan, a streetcar conductor, who died on November 16, 1895, in what was then the largest transportation accident in American history, when the streetcar he was riding on plunged over an open viaduct into the river. (https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/515). Stanton was one of six children, four of whom died before the age of 21. Stanton was an Eagle Scout, and was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout by the National Eagle Scout Association in March 2002. He graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1942. He received his draft notice on Thanksgiving Day in 1942 and spent the following four years in Hawaii, New Guinea, and the Philippines with the 33rd Infantry Division Reconnaissance Troop. He received the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He briefly considered attending the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University but the line was too long, so he switched to business administration. In 1949, Stanton graduated from Georgetown University, having also been president of the senior class for that year. Stanton was a businessman by profession. After college, he followed in his father's footsteps and opened his own Lincoln-Mercury dealership in Painesville, where one of his salespeople was Don Shula, who later became coach of the Miami Dolphins football team. The business grew into one of the largest Ford Motor Co. franchises. He decided to run for county commissioner after county-wide regulations prohibited a plant that was planning on locating in Painesville, Ohio to relocate in Lorain, Ohio. He was elected Lake County commissioner in 1956 and 1960. Stanton often said he chose to be a Republican because it was the party of Abraham Lincoln, but he considered himself socially liberal and fiscally conservative. His New York Times obituary noted he was a friend to both business leaders and labor organizations. He was elected as a Republican to the 89th to 97th Congresses, (January 3, 1965 - January 3, 1983). He did not seek election to the 98th United States Congress, and later served as an executive at the World Bank. He died in Jacksonville, Florida on April 11, 2002. Stanton is, to date, the last Republican to represent Ohio's 11th district in Congress.

Biography In 1946, Sawka was born to an architect father and linguist mother, Jan and Maria Sawka, in the Silesian city of Zabrze. His childhood was overshadowed by his father's Stalin-era political imprisonment. Sawka completed two master's degrees; in painting and print- making from the Wroc≈Çaw Fine Arts Academy and in Architectural Engineering from the Institute of Technology in Wroc≈Çaw. By his late 20s, Sawka was a star of the famed Polish Poster School and a leading artist of the counter-culture. His oppositionist activities lead to his exile in 1976. After 1977, he resided in New York, becoming part of the American cultural mainstream. Early in his time in the United States, Sawka created editorial drawings for the New York Times, while developing a multi-faceted career that encompassed printmaking, painting, sculpture, and theater design. Numerous galleries have exhibited his paintings and prints, and he has designed for such theaters as the Harold Clurman, Jean Cocteau Repertory and Samuel Beckett Theater. Sawka's works are in over 60 museums around the world and he has had over 70 solo shows at international museums and galleries. His awards have included the 1975 Oscar de la Peinture in Cagnes-sur-Mer, France for painting and the Gold Medal at the 1978 Warsaw Poster Biennial. In 1981, when martial law was imposed in Poland, the AFL-CIO sponsored a bipartisan fundraiser that sold Sawka's Solidarity poster in the millions to provide immediate support to the besieged Solidarity movement. In 1989, Sawka designed a 10-story tall set for The Grateful Dead's 25th Anniversary tour. In 1993, he created his first full multi-media spectacle, \\"The Eyes\\" in Japan. This was the beginning of his collaboration with Japanese studios and corporations, which includes the creation of high-tech interactive sculptures and monumental installations, as well as designs for full-scale monumental architecture. Sawka designed \\"The Tower of Light Cultural Complex\\" for Abu Dhabi, U.A.E., presented to the Royal Family in 1996. A pilot version of \\"The Voyage\\", a full-length multimedia spectacle, won the Gold Medal in Multi-Media at the 2003 Florence Contemporary Art Biennial.

Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 16 March 1934 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 23 April 1934 by Little, Brown and Company, New York.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 65-66, A51. The story had previously been serialised, in the Strand Magazine in the UK from August 1933 to February 1934, and in the US in Cosmopolitan Magazine from January to June 1934.Cawthorne (2013), p. 92. Thank You, Jeeves is the first full-length novel in the series of stories following narrator Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves, though Jeeves leaves Bertie's employment for most of this story. The novel largely takes place around Chuffnell Hall, the home of Bertie's friend Lord \\"Chuffy\\" Chuffnell, who hopes to sell the house to the wealthy J. Washburn Stoker and is in love with Stoker's daughter Pauline. Plot After a falling-out concerning Bertie's relentless playing of the banjolele, Jeeves leaves his master's service and finds work with Bertie's old friend, Lord \\"Chuffy\\" Chuffnell. Bertie travels to one of Chuffy's cottages in Somersetshire to practise the banjolele without complaints from neighbours. Chuffy hopes to sell his dilapidated manor to the rich J. Washburn Stoker. Mr Stoker plans to rent out the property to the famous \\"nerve specialist\\" (or, as Bertie prefers, \\"loony doctor\\") Sir Roderick Glossop, who intends to marry Chuffy's Aunt Myrtle. Chuffy has also fallen in love with Mr Stoker's daughter, Pauline Stoker, a former fianc√©e of Bertie, but feels unable to propose to her until his finances improve. Bertie plans to kiss Pauline in front of Chuffy to spur Chuffy to propose. However, it is Mr Stoker who sees the kiss. A fight between Mr Stoker's son Dwight and Chuffy's cousin Seabury divides the Chuffnells and Stokers. Mr Stoker returns to the yacht in which he and his family are staying. Thinking Bertie and Pauline are still in love, Stoker keeps Pauline on board to keep her from him. Chuffy writes a love letter to Pauline, which Jeeves smuggles aboard the yacht by briefly entering Mr Stoker's employ; Pauline is so moved that she swims ashore to Bertie's house, planning to visit Chuffnell Hall in the morning. Bertie lets her sleep in his bed while he tries to sleep in the garage. Unfortunately, he is seen by Police Sergeant Voules, who informs Lord Chuffnell. Chuffy, thinking Bertie is intoxicated, takes him back up to his bedroom. Seeing Pauline there, Chuffy assumes she and Bertie have resumed their romantic relationship. Chuffy and Pauline argue, and return to their respective homes. The next day, Mr Stoker invites Bertie to his yacht, but locks him in one of the rooms. Stoker found out about Pauline's visit to Bertie, and plans to force them to marry. Jeeves helps Bertie escape: Mr Stoker has hired some blackface minstrels for his son's party, and Bertie disguises himself by blacking his face with boot polish to go ashore with them. Bertie returns to his cottage. His new valet, Brinkley, is drunk and chases Bertie with a carving knife, then sets the cottage on fire, destroying Bertie's banjolele. Searching for butter to remove the boot polish from his face, Bertie goes to Chuffnell Hall. Chuffy, thinking that Pauline loves Bertie and that Bertie should not try to abandon Pauline, refuses to give him butter. Jeeves, again in Chuffy's employ, informs Bertie that Sir Roderick had blackened his face with boot polish to entertain Seabury; unappreciative, Seabury made a butter-slide using all the Hall's butter to make Sir Roderick fall, resulting in an altercation and Sir Roderick leaving the hall. Jeeves suggests that Bertie sleep in the Dower House, where Jeeves will bring him butter the next day. However, Brinkley is occupying the Dower House. Bertie sees Sir Roderick, who now feels friendly towards Bertie, since Bertie dislikes Seabury. Sir Roderick goes to Bertie's garage to find petrol, which he says can remove boot polish; Bertie, wishing to avoid Sergeant Voules, does not join him. Bertie sleeps in a summer-house. In the morning, Bertie meets with Jeeves in Chuffy's office. Mr Stoker is looking for Bertie; Jeeves tells him that Bertie is in the Dower House. Pauline appears, and Bertie reveals himself suddenly to her. Startled, Pauline shrieks, bringing Chuffy running to her. The couple reconciles. After Mr Stoker returns from a run-in with Brinkley, Jeeves delivers a cable saying that Mr Stoker's relatives are contesting the will of his late uncle, who left him fifty million dollars, on the grounds that the deceased was insane. Stoker is confident that Sir Roderick will testify against this. However, Sir Roderick has been arrested trying to break into Bertie's garage; his testimony will not have much weight if he is imprisoned. Jeeves suggests that Bertie switch places with Sir Roderick, as he could hardly be charged with breaking into his own garage. The plan succeeds. Stoker will buy the Hall, and Chuffy and Pauline are to be wed. Jeeves reveals that he was responsible for the cable. Stating that it has never been his policy to serve a married gentleman, Jeeves returns to Bertie's employ. Very surprised and grateful, Bertie has difficulty finding words, and simply says, \\"Thank you, Jeeves.\\"Wodehouse (2008) [1934], chapter 22, p. 263. Style According to writer Robert McCrum, the plot of Thank You, Jeeves, which follows the separation and reconciliation of Bertie and Jeeves, \\"is constructed like a classic romance in which a couple quarrel, separate and are finally reunited\\".McCrum (2004), p. 210. Author Kristin Thompson makes the same statement about the story's construction, and adds that despite the feud, Bertie and Jeeves interact in a friendly manner after their initial argument, which allows Bertie and Jeeves to work together to help Chuffy and Pauline and move towards reconciliation.Thompson (1992), pp. 237‚Äì238. \\"Thank You, Jeeves in particular is constructed like a romance in which a married couple quarrels, separates, and eventually reunites.\\" While Bertie Wooster is threatened with marriage in some of the earlier short stories in which he appears, he also faces other kinds of disaster which Jeeves helps him avoid. The emphasis of the plot shifts in Thank You, Jeeves. Beginning with this novel, Bertie's efforts to avoid marriage become the mainspring of the plot. This essential situation occurs in each of the following Jeeves novels.Hall (1974), p. 27. Bertie's language becomes considerably more formal starting in Thank You, Jeeves; this is acknowledged in chapter 4, when Bertie states that his vocabulary has improved due to Jeeves's influence.Hall (1974), p. 91. Another shift starting with Thank You, Jeeves is that, unlike many of the short stories, each Jeeves novel is set principally at a country house and the nearby surrounding area, allowing Wodehouse to bring more characters together to create longer, more complex stories.Thompson (1992), pp. 140‚Äì141. Wodehouse utilizes various styles and language, for instance moving between formal language in narration and informal language in dialogue. He sometimes makes fun of purism, the excessive insistence on adherence to a particular use of language, as in chapter 9: > \\"You have a perfect right to love who you like...\\" > \\"Whom, old man,\\" I couldn't help saying. Jeeves has made me rather a purist > in these matters. In this quote, there is comic contrast between the tense situation and the comparatively petty concern about \\"correctness\\" in language.Hall (1974), pp. 60‚Äì61. Wodehouse occasionally derives words from phrases using suffixation, for example the adjective \\"fiend-in-human-shape-y\\" in chapter 12.Hall (1974), p. 74. A transferred epithet is used in chapter 2: \\"Such, then, is the sequence of events which led up to Bertram Wooster [...] standing at the door [...] through the aromatic smoke of a meditative cigarette\\".Hall (1974), p. 86. Bertie often uses unnecessary abbreviations, sometimes referring to words by only their initial letters. This can be seen in chapter 21, when Sir Roderick Glossop is imprisoned in a shed: \\"Can you remove Sir R. from the s., Jeeves?\\".Hall (1974), p. 94. Another stylistic device Wodehouse uses to create humour is the pun. For example, a pun is used in chapter 1, after Jeeves gives notice: > \\"No, sir. I fear I cannot recede from my position.\\" > \\"But, dash it, you say you are receding from your position.\\" > \\"I should have said, I cannot abandon the stand which I have taken.\\"Hall > (1974), p. 96. Wodehouse uses vivid, exaggerated imagery drawing on a wide range of sources. This imagery at first seems comedically incongruous and yet is appropriate to the situation. Examples include the following quotes: \\"We are the parfait gentle knights, and we feel that it ill beseems us to make a beeline for a girl like a man charging into a railway restaurant for a bowl of soup\\" (chapter 4), and \\"The light faded from her face, and in its stead there appeared the hurt, bewildered look of a barefoot dancer who, while halfway through the Vision of Salome, steps on a tin tack\\" (chapter 9).Hall (1974), pp. 107‚Äì108. When violence occurs in Wodehouse's stories, it causes either no injury or much less than would be expected in real life, similar to the downplayed injuries that occur in stage comedy. Wodehouse also sometimes references violent imagery where there is no actual violence, for example in Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 14: \\"The poor old lad distinctly leaped. The cigarette flew out of his hand, his teeth came together with a snap, and he shook visibly. The whole effect being much as if I had spiked him in the trousering with a gimlet or bodkin\\". By presenting an intentionally partial depiction of violence in comic situations and imagery, Wodehouse demonstrates that violence does not always need to be taken seriously and can be used to add amusement to a comic portrayal of existence.Hall (1974), p. 46. Bertie, as the first-person narrator of the story, is an unreliable narrator in the sense that he does not know how much the events of the story result from Jeeves's scheming. The reader must infer to what extent Jeeves influences other characters or creates any of the problems he ultimately solves. It is possible that Jeeves schemes from the start to return to Bertie's employ and get rid of Bertie's banjolele, and enters Chuffy's employment knowing that Chuffy would be near Bertie. Interpreting events through hints provided by Bertie's narration presents what Thompson calls \\"a perpetual and delightful challenge to the reader\\".Thompson (1992), pp. 156‚Äì158. For example, Thompson suggests there is a hint that Jeeves may have deliberately led Bertie into trouble by arranging that Stoker rather than Chuffy saw Bertie kiss Pauline. When Bertie learns that Chuffy is jealous because Bertie was once engaged to Pauline, Bertie comments, \\"I began to perceive that in arranging that Stoker and not he should be the witness of the recent embrace the guardian angel of the Woosters had acted dashed shrewdly\\" (chapter 6). According to Thompson, \\"We know the identity of the somewhat diabolical guardian angel of this particular Wooster\\".Thompson (1992), p. 235. Background The book uses the dated and now derogatory term \\"nigger minstrels\\" which was once a common term for white performers in blackface. Blackface minstrels were a staple of British seaside resorts until World War II. The term \\"nigger minstrels\\" was historically used to differentiate blackface minstrels from \\"colored minstrels\\" who were actually black performers. Blackface performances, widely considered offensive today, were popular at the time Wodehouse was writing this novel. During this period, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby and Shirley Temple were among the many actors who performed in blackface.Wodehouse (2013), p. 230. As stated by editor Sophie Ratcliffe: \\"Wodehouse was writing this novel when 'blackface' performers were the height of fashion. Al Jolson, Bing Crosby and Shirley Temple were among many actors who performed blacked up during this period.\\" While planning Thank You, Jeeves, Wodehouse wrote a letter to his friend William Townend about ideas for the novel. In the letter, dated 1 April 1932, Wodehouse wrote that he was writing \\"a Jeeves novel where Bertie, who is blacked up like a nigger minstrel, is scouring the countryside for butter to remove his blacking\\". According to the letter, Wodehouse was considering ideas that do not appear in the final novel, including an idea of Bertie breaking into an animal breeder's house for butter and being confronted by a number of animals, and another idea in which Bertie ends up at a girls' school, gets chased by a Games Mistress (a woman who teaches sports), and subsequently hides in a dormitory, where the kids welcome him enthusiastically because they think he is a blackface minstrel.Wodehouse (2013), p. 231. Publication history The story was illustrated by Gilbert Wilkinson in the Strand and by James Montgomery Flagg in Cosmopolitan. The novel was finished by the end of May 1932. Thank You, Jeeves appeared in serial form in the Canadian magazine Family Herald and Weekly Star from 24 March to 11 August 1937, with illustrations by James H. Hammon.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 189-190, D146.10-D146.25. The 1977 Coronet paperback edition contains a glaring error. On the outer back cover, in the plot summary, Chuffy is referred to as 'Lord Chuffington'. Reception * The Times (16 March 1934): \\"One thinks of the world of Mr. Wodehouse as being perfect, and therefore stable‚Äîa world in which there is no change nor need for change. It comes, therefore, as a shock to read in the publishers' note to his new book that Jeeves has been translated from his sphere of the short story. ‚Ä¶ There is a further and more disintegrating shock in the first chapter; it is headed 'Jeeves gives Notice,' and for a moment it leads the reader to fear that there is an end to his association with his employer, Mr. Bertram Wooster. ‚Ä¶ The ending is doubly happy; happy for the lovers, for about the last thing we learn of the leading lady is that 'She remained in Chuffy's arms gurgling like a leaky radiator'; and happy for the reader, for the last thing we learn of Jeeves is that he has re-entered the service of Mr. Wooster\\". * John Chamberlain, The New York Times (23 April 1934): \\"Clifton Fadiman has a theory that P.G. Wodehouse gets his comic effects by judicious combination of understatement and overstatement, poetry and cold water. This is only the half of it. At the bottom of Mr. Wodehouse's genius is an ability to make his consonants dance, pirouette, leap, roll over and play dead. ‚Ä¶ Jeeves, good old Jeeves, silent as the Sphinx except when spoken to, saves the day for romance. The status of international marriage is preserved, in spite of the growing nationalism that bids fair to rob Mr. Wodehouse of many of his best situations. In brief, \\"Thank You, Jeeves!\\" is a satisfactory, a bonhomous, book, brought to no bad end\\". * George Stevens, The Saturday Review (28 April 1934): \\"There is no way of reviewing this book that makes sense. To the Wodehouse following, it only requires announcement. To the others, who have tried Wodehouse and found themselves wanting, one can only say that they don't know what they are missing. One cannot go further. To say that his latest book is his funniest is a bromide; his latest book is always his funniest\\". * The New York Times Book Review (29 April 1934): \\"The glory of Jeeves passes all overstatement. Footing it, as he would justly say, featly through the antic and astounding mazes of Bertie Wooster's hilarious career, he does some of the soundest brain-work of our epoch. ‚Ä¶ Chuffy falls impractically in love with Pauline, J. Washburn decides that Bertie must marry Pauline after all, Sir Roderick becomes enamored of the Dowager Lady Chuffnell, and, with all that to go on, one of Wodehouse's most pleasing pandemoniums gets going\\". * Fanny Butcher, The Chicago Tribune (19 May 1934): \\"Mr. Wodehouse has written more times than I remember the same tale about the good-hearted but goofy young Englishman with more money than brains, his superior 'man,' and a series of impossible and hilarious situations in a (slanguage) language which is by Broadway out of Bond Street. But to those who find it to their taste it's the sweetest story ever told, Wodehouse's Old Sweet Song. I am one of those who get a thorough laughing jag on Wodehouse and the more utterly absurd he is the better, say I. He's utterly utter in \\"Thank You, Jeeves\\"'. Adaptations =Film= Thank You, Jeeves! is also the name of a theatrical film from 1936, starring Arthur Treacher as Jeeves and David Niven as Bertie Wooster, and directed by Arthur Greville Collins; aside from the presence of Bertie and Jeeves, however, none of the characters or major plot elements are taken from the novel. Bertie does play a musical instrument despite disapproval from Jeeves early in the film, though Bertie plays drums instead of a banjolele. =Television= This novel was adapted into the television series Jeeves and Wooster episodes \\"Chuffy\\" and \\"Kidnapped!\\", which first aired 5 May 1991 and 12 May 1991, respectively. There are several differences in plot: * In the television series, the banjolele was replaced by a trombone, which Jeeves terms as \\"not an instrument for a gentleman.\\" * Sir Roderick Glossop does not appear in the first episode. Instead, Stoker originally wants to make the Hall a hotel. * In the television series, Mr. Manglehoffer, the manager of Berkeley Mansions, appears instead of Sir Roderick to give Bertie the ultimatum personally rather than via telephone. * In the television series, the cottage and Chuffy's manor are located in Devon, not Somersetshire. * In the television series, instead of being Chuffy's aunt Lady Chuffnell, Myrtle is his sister, Mrs. Pongleton. Sir Roderick Glossop is still married to Lady Glossop, and is never engaged to Myrtle. * In the television series, Brinkley's political views are never mentioned. Instead, he is portrayed as a grouchy, amoral, opportunistic, middle-aged man. * In the first episode, Bertie's cottage catches fire when Chuffy tries to return Bertie to bed. Chuffy saves Pauline from the fire. Jeeves had intended for Stoker to discover Pauline in Bertie's room, so he would look more kindly on Chuffy. Jeeves returns to Bertie's employment and they go home. * In the second episode, members of the Drones Club form the blackface minstrel troupe; in the original story, Bertie does not know the minstrels. * In the television series, Stoker locks both Bertie and Jeeves inside a room on his yacht. =Radio= Thank You, Jeeves was adapted into a radio drama in 1975 as part of the series What Ho! Jeeves starring Michael Hordern as Jeeves and Richard Briers as Bertie Wooster. In 1998, the novel was dramatized by L.A. Theatre Works, with Paxton Whitehead voicing Jeeves and Simon Templeman voicing Bertie Wooster. Directed by Rosalind Ayres, the radio drama also featured Gregory Cooke as Chuffy, Jennifer Tilly as Pauline Stoker, Guy Siner as Sir Roderick Glossop, Kenneth Danziger as Sergeant Voules, Alastair Duncan as Brinkley and Seabury, and Dominic Keating as Constable Dobson. J. Washburn Stoker was voiced by Richard Riordan, who was Mayor of Los Angeles at the time of recording. In this adaptation, the minstrel musicians were changed to Appalachian hillbilly performers.Taves (2006), p. 135. Taves also states that the plot was condensed to under an hour, but the radio drama is actually 1 hour 28 minutes long, excluding the introduction and credits. To help Bertie escape from Stoker's yacht, Jeeves disguises Bertie as one of the performers by giving him a false beard, using dyed cotton wool applied with adhesive. Bertie then requires butter, like in the novel, to remove the adhesive. Mark Richard, who adapted the story for L.A. Theatre Works, had previously incorporated this change into a 1996 stage adaptation of the novel. Richard's adaptation was also used for a 2013 stage production of Thank You, Jeeves.

It premiered at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, and was nominated for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 78th Academy Awards. The Boston Globe called it \\"the year's best documentary about the animal world.\\" Overview The film opens with a Soviet-made Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane landing on Mwanza airfield in Mwanza, Tanzania, near Lake Victoria. The plane came from Europe to ship back processed fillets of Nile Perch, a species of fish introduced into Lake Victoria that has caused the extinction of hundreds of endemic species. Through interviews with the Russian and Ukrainian plane crew, local factory owners, guards, prostitutes, fishermen and other villagers, the film discusses the effects of the introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria, how it has affected the ecosystem and economy of the region. The film also dwells at length on the dichotomy between European aid which is being funneled into Africa on the one hand, and the unending flow of munitions and weapons from European arms dealers on the other. Arms and munitions are often flown in on the same planes which transport the Nile perch fillets to European consumers, feeding the very conflicts which the aid was sent to remedy. As Dima, the radio engineer of the plane crew, says later on in the film: the children of Angola receive guns for Christmas, the children of Europe receive grapes. The appalling living and working conditions of the indigenous people, in which basic sanitation is completely absent and many children turn to drugs and prostitution, is covered in great depth; because the Nile perch is fished and processed for export, all the prime fillets are sold to European supermarkets, leaving the local people to survive on the festering carcasses of the gutted fish. As to why the local fish can not be sold to the domestic market to counter the impending famine (local news reports relayed in the film indicated Northern and Central Tanzania were facing famine), one fish processing factory manager says \\"it is too expensive\\".

History In lieu of the establishment of Lurgan Model primary school in 1863, the town of Lurgan required a secondary education school which met the educational needs of the growing industrial town. The owner of a local brewery, Samuel Watts, set out plans for an endowment fund in his will for the formation of a middle class, secondary school which provided education to boys in Agriculture, Classics and English. After Watt's death in February 1850, a Trustee Committee was formed to ensure the ¬£9000 in Watt's will would contribute towards creating a new school. However, it was not until December 1872 that the Trustee Committee had gathered enough funds to commence construction of the school. The school was established at a residence on Market Hill, Lurgan in March 1873. The first headmaster was E. V. Boulger of Dublin. The construction of the school buildings in the township of Brownlowsderry was completed in August 1873 and the school accepted its first cohort of students in October of the same year. Boulger was a Classical scholar and uncomfortable among small boys, and left in 1875, to be replaced by William T. Kirkpatrick of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. Kirkpatrick oversaw the student population grow numerically and was responsible for the growth in academics at the College. Kirkpatrick retired in 1899 and Mr James Cowan of Manchester Grammar School assumed principality of the College. Cowan was responsible for the introduction of Science education in the College in 1905 and the further integration of female student admission in 1918. Cowan retired in 1922 having failed to rectify the school's dwindling numbers with under 30 pupils enrolled when he retired. Present Day The school continues to rank within the top 20 Northern Irish secondary level schools in the Sunday Times Parent Power Survey. The school has received the necessary funding to proceed with plans to erect a new building, replacing all of the current accommodation except for the listed 1873 portion. Work was to commence in March 2009, but this still has not happened due to departmental cuts. Notable former pupils Albert Lewis, father of the author C.S. Lewis (1898‚Äì1963), attended the school from 1877-79 under Headmaster W.T. Kirkpatrick. Albert later became Kirkpatrick's solicitor. When Kirkpatrick retired and began to privately tutor pupils he taught both of Albert's sons, first Warnie Lewis whom he prepared for the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and later C.S. Lewis himself. William \\"W.T.\\" Kirkpatrick, headmaster of the school in the late 19th century, was a private tutor to C.S. Lewis in the mid 1910s. He was inspiration for the character Digory Kirke (a professor) who was created by C.S. Lewis for the Narnia books a quarter of a century later.

Rait Kerr was born in Bray, Ireland third son of Sylvester Rait Kerr of Rathmoyle, Edenderry King's Co and led a distinguished army career. He was educated at Rugby. He graduated from Sandhurst in 1910 and joined the Royal Engineers. By 1916 he had been promoted to temporary captain, and by 1917 he was acting major and had been awarded the Military Cross and the D.S.O.. As a cricketer, he played in six first-class matches. Five of these were for the Europeans in India between 1913‚Äì14 and 1920‚Äì21, while the other came after a decade's absence from first- class cricket when he appeared for the Army against Oxford University in 1931. He succeeded William Findlay as Secretary of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1936 and he retired in 1952. His daughter Diana Rait Kerr became the first Curator of the MCC and she later became one of the first elected lady members of the club in 1999.

Note the many perforations running along the casing from bow to stern The casing of a submarine is a light metal structure, usually incorporating a deck, built over the upper surface of the vessel's pressure hull. The pressure hull of a submarine is usually cylindrical and possesses a low freeboard when in the water, which makes walking on the hull when on the surface dangerous in high seas or rough weather. The casing provides a flat and therefore safer platform for personnel to walk on. The casing is outside the pressure hull and free-flooding so is usually perforated with numerous holes, allowing water to enter and trapped air to escape easily, eliminating any buoyancy contributed by the casing and allowing the submarine to submerge with as little delay as possible. Casings have been eliminated since the end of World War II as the flow of water through the numerous flood- holes creates noise that may be detected by an enemy using passive sonar, as well as causing hydrodynamic drag.

Early life and education Roy Kevin Andrews was born a U.S. citizen in Peking. His mother was Yvette Borup Andrews, but there is controversy over the name of his father. Yvette was married to Roy Chapman Andrews at the time of Kevin‚Äôs birth, but the first man to visit her to see the new born son was not Roy Chapman Andrews, but Harold St Clair (Chips) Smallwood. On the eve of Kevin‚Äôs marriage, nearly 30 years later, Nancy announced to Kevin that Smallwood, and not Roy Chapman Andrews, was his father. This was to have a fundamental and shattering effect on Kevin who constantly and incessantly obsessed on his own identity. His mother's ancestors included George A. Brandreth, Aaron Ward, and Elkanah Watson, all prominent in New York business and politics. Kevin Andrews was schooled in England at Stowe, where he learned classical Greek. He served for three years as a private in the US Army seeing action in Italy. After graduating from Harvard in 1947 he entered for a travelling fellowship in Athens, and his future life in Greece was decided by chance when he was successful; as he said \\"the award ... was fortuitous since no one else applied for it, and is relevant only as the reason why I went to Greece in the first place.\\". Arrival in Greece After a month spent on Paros helping Greek-American friends with the grape-harvest, Andrews arrived in the autumn of 1947 at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. It was a time of civil war, the rate of inflation was high and the Greek people were suffering extreme hardship. He was unfortunate and suffered from an \\"obscure nervous disorder,\\" which turned out to be epilepsy, and spent much of his first winter in a miserable draughty room. Travel on the mainland was severely restricted; a permit was needed to travel more than a few miles from Athens. It could also be dangerous, for a few days after the students had visited Mycenae Kenneth Matthews, an English journalist, was kidnapped there; some travellers were unlucky, and George Polk, a US reporter, was captured in the mountains and his body was washed up soon afterwards near Salonika. After a disappointing stay in Greece Andrews was preparing to leave when he was offered a Fulbright Fellowship to stay and carry out a study of the castles and fortifications built by various invaders in the Peloponnese. This offered a field unresearched by others and the freedom to travel alone, and so he accepted with delight.Andrews, Kevin, (1959), The Flight of Ikaros: a journey into Greece, pp23-25. Traveller in the Peloponnese Andrews spent the long summers of 1948 to 1951 travelling around the Peloponnese, the winters writing up in Athens. His journeys and the people he met are described vividly in The Flight of Ikaros (published 1959, reissued 1969 and 1984), \\"one of the great and lasting books about Greece.\\"Leigh Fermor, Patrick, in Andrews, Kevin, (1959), The Flight of Ikaros: a journey into Greece (Penguin edition), cover notes. As this overlapped with the Greek Civil War and its aftermath, it was a time of mistrust, particularly of foreigners (and especially of one making plans and notes in the hills), but he soon gained the trust of country people on both sides of the conflict. He became friends with a shepherd in the Geraneia (ŒìŒµœÅŒ¨ŒΩŒµŒπŒ±) hills and become his child's koumbaros or member of the family and godfather. His time in Greece closed with an ascent of Mount Olympus, described in the book, the first by a westerner since the outbreak of the civil war. The fruit of his work, Castles of the Morea, was published in 1953 (reissued 2006). He returned to the US only to feel an exile, after failing to get a job connected with US aid in Greece. Greece was in the process of reconstruction and the domestic politics were dominated by America, left-wing politics was banned and many activists were shot or placed in camps. During this period he met Nancy Thayer, E.E. Cummings's daughter, who was married to Kevin¬í's friend Willard Roosevelt at the time. Kevin and Nancy married in 1954 and the next year moved to Europe with her first two children, eventually settling in Athens; the couple later had two children of their own, Ioanna and Alexis. In 1968 Nancy and Kevin separated, and she and her children moved to London because, according to Kevin's biographer Roger Jinkinson,Jinkinson, Roger - American Ikaros (biography) (published 2010) \\"she did not want to live under the Junta nor have her children brought up in a police state\\"; she kept the name Nancy T. Andrews and hoped they could someday reconcile.Webster, Michael P., \\"A Memorial: Nancy T. Andrews, Daughter of E. E. Cummings ,\\" Spring 14-15 (2005-2006): 260-268. Later writing Back in Greece Kevin Andrews's next publication Athens was published in 1967. It was a counterblast against a westernized Greece which had been sanitized for the tourist. Protest had to be guarded and he waited until the departure of the Junta in 1974 before plain writing about political matters was possible. Writings in this period included an essay on Louis MacNeice and a lengthy autobiographical poem published in book form, called First Will and Testament. In 1975 he relinquished his US citizenship and became nationalized as a Greek. Athens Alive followed in 1980, it is a book of writings about Athens from Ovid in AD 7 to Cavafy and Hemingway in the 20th century.Leigh Fermor, Patrick, (1980), Interfering in Greece: review of Athens Alive in Words of Mercury pp. 234-245. In 1988, Andrews met Elizabeth Boleman-Herring in Athens. In the late summer of 1989 they traveled to Kythira, an island off the southern tip of the Peloponnese. On 1 September they walked to Cape Trachylos at the southern end of the island, Andrews started a swim to Avgo (ŒëœÖŒ≥œå), a rocky island, the reputed birthplace of Aphrodite. He drowned and his body was recovered the next day.Sousveillance Blog retrieved September 2006 (this URL is not stable).

At McKie's trial in 1999, the SCRO fingerprint evidence was rejected and she was acquitted. Mackay's interim report on the matter was submitted to the Crown Office on 3 August 2000 and on its strength the four SCRO fingerprint experts were suspended and Scottish ministers were informed.

However, the Crown Office decided to take no action against the four fingerprint personnel, who had been reinstated in the SCRO.

Description The Snoldelev Stone, which is 1.25 meters in height, is decorated with a design of three drinking horns interlocking as incomplete Borromean rings (similar to the Diane de Poitiers three crescents emblem). The stone was first noted in 1810, and was turned over to the national Antiquities Commission in 1811. The runestone is now housed at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, Denmark. The inscription on the Snoldelev Stone shows an early version of the Younger Futhark. Like the late Elder Futhark Bj√∂rketorp Runestone, it uses an a-rune 10px which has the same form as the h-rune has in the long-branch version of the younger futhark. This a-rune is transliterated with capital A below. The Snoldelev runestone also retains the elder futhark haglaz rune (10px) for the h-phoneme and this is represented by capital H in the transliteration below. The last character in the runic text is damaged, but is clearly a 10px, and represents the first use of this rune for an 'm' in Denmark. The text is arranged in two lines of different size. It has been suggested that this may have been done in imitation of Merovingian or Carolingian manuscripts, which have the first line in long slender characters with the following lines in shorter, stubbier text. The inscription states that Gunnvaldr is a √ûul Ä, which signifies some office or rank, perhaps a priest or a skald, compare Old Norse √æula meaning \\"litany.\\" It is related to the later Norse √ûulr, a position described as being a wise man or sage associated with Scandinavian chieftains and royalty.

Commissioned in late 1864, she participated in the First in December and Second Battles of Fort Fisher in January 1865. The ship was later assigned to the James River Flotilla on the approaches to the Confederate capitol of Richmond, Virginia and then sailed to Spanish Cuba to intercept the Confederate ironclad CSS Stonewall. Monadnock was then docked for a few months to prepare her for her transfer to California around the tip of South America. The monitor and her escorts departed in late 1865 and reached the Chilean port of Valpara√≠so in early 1866 where the Americans unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the Spanish from bombarding the undefended town during the Chincha Islands War. The ships reached California in June and Monadnock was decommissioned at the end of the month. The monitor was sold for scrap in 1874. The Navy Department evaded the Congressional refusal to order new ships by claiming that the Civil War-era ship was being repaired while building a new monitor of the same name.

The engines were rated at and gave the ship a top speed of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 121 She was designed to carry of coal.Canney, p. 65 =Armament and armor= Her main battery consisted of four smoothbore, muzzle-loading, Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the single funnel. Each gun weighed approximately . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +7¬∞.Olmstead, et al, p. 94 The sides of the hull of the Miantonomoh-class ships were protected by five layers of wrought-iron plates that tapered at their bottom edge down to total of , backed by of wood. The armor of the gun turret consisted of ten layers of one-inch plates and the pilot house had eight layers. The ship's deck was protected by armor thick. The bases of the funnel and the ventilator were also protected by unknown thicknesses of armor. Construction and career USS Monadnock towing a disabled gun boat off Cape Hatteras (1865) Monadnock, named after Mount Monadnock, a mountain in southern New Hampshire, was laid down at the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1862. The ship was launched on 23 March 1863 and commissioned on 4 October 1864. She subsequently steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, and there Commander Enoch Parrott assumed command on 20 November. On 13 December she departed Norfolk for the assault against Fort Fisher and joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron two days later. The reinforced squadron approached Fort Fisher on 24 December as part of the Union fleet.Monadnock At ranges of she bombarded the fortification and continued throughout the day. The following morning she resumed shelling the fortUnited States, Official Records, 11, p. 276 as 2,000 Army troops under the command of General Benjamin F. Butler landed north of the fort. The soldiers were withdrawn later that day when Butler received word of approaching Confederate troops and worsening weather that would prevent him from evacuating his troops.Foote, pp. 719‚Äì720 Although the Navy had believed that its fire was accurate and effective, it was neither because many gunners had aimed at the Confederate flag flying above the fort and their shells had flown across the peninsula to land the Cape Fear River.Foote, p. 742 A second assault was begun on the morning of 13 January 1865 with the ironclads the first to fire in the hopes of provoking the Confederate gunners to retaliate and reveal the positions of their gun so that they could be engaged by the rest of the fleet. The ironclads had anchored to make their fire more accurate and Monadnock kept up a slow and deliberate fire during the day and into the night. Resupplying ammunition at night the ship kept up her fire through the 15th.United States, Official Records, 11, p. 462 After Rear Admiral David D. Porter ordered that his ships were to aim at the walls of Fort Fisher rather than the flag, the bombardment was much more effective and many guns were dismounted or disabled.Foote, pp. 742‚Äì744 Monadnocks side armor was struck five times during the battle with little damage inflicted; the turrets and the ventilation pipe were also hit five times with no damage recorded.United States, Official Records, 11, pp. 462‚Äì463 One of the monitor's sailors, Quartermaster William Dunn, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Fort Fisher engagements. Monadnock was ordered to Charleston, South Carolina, on 18 January to reinforce the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron there under the command of Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren.United States, Official Records, 11, p. 614 After the Confederates abandoned Charleston and its surrender on 18 February, Monadnocks crew took possession of the blockade runner the following day and the monitor entered Charleston Harbor on the 20th. After a stay at Port Royal, South Carolina, she steamed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 15 March and then up the James River where she was assigned to the James River Flotilla. By 18 March, Commander William Ronckendorff had relieved Parrott in command of the ship.United States, Official Records, 12, pp. 67, 72 On 2 April, she steamed to support the final assault on Richmond and then assisted in clearing the river of naval mines. Returning to Hampton Roads on 7 April, Monadnock was assigned to the squadron commanded by Acting Rear Admiral Sylvanus Godon, which had been established to search for the Stonewall.United States, Official Records, 3, pp. 525‚Äì526, 535 The French-built ship had been ordered by the Confederacy, embargoed and sold to Denmark in 1864 and resold to the Confederacy in January 1865. Delayed by rudder problems, she was enroute to the United States and ultimately made landfall in Spanish Cuba on 15 May.Stonewall The squadron departed two days later and put into Charleston Harbor on the 22nd to re-coal and to be reinforced by the monitor before continuing on to Havana, Cuba. They arrived on 28 May to find that the Stonewall had been temporarily turned over to the Spanish government.United States, Official Records, 12, p. 145 Monadnocks presence no longer required, she arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 12 June and continued onwards to the League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to prepare for her impending voyage to California. =Voyage around South America= Monadnock as she appeared in Callao, Peru, showing all the modifications made for the voyage To prepare the monitor for the voyage, she was fitted with a breakwater to prevent head seas from battering her forward turret and tall, wooden pilot houses above the existing ones. During the trip a jury-rigged foremast was added which reportedly added to her speed.Canney, pp. 66‚Äì67 Monadnock departed on 5 October in company with the paddle frigates and and the sloop . The monitor steamed the entire way to California entirely under her own speed and the biggest problem reported was that temperatures in the fire room ranged from .

Commodore John Rogers, commander of the American squadron, attempted to persuade Admiral Casto M√©ndez N√∫√±ez to forego the bombardment, but the latter claimed it was a point of Spanish honor. Rogers even had his ships clear for action in an unsuccessful attempt to intimidate M√©ndez N√∫√±ez and was prepared to open fire if he received support from the small British squadron in the harbor. That was not forthcoming as the British minister in the town forbade Rear-Admiral Joseph Denham to act and Rogers was forced to stand down.Jones, pp. 98‚Äì99 Monadnocks arrival at Acapulco coincided with a Mexican siege of the town's French defenders during the Second French intervention in Mexico.Alden, p. 80 The squadron continued on to San Francisco, anchoring off that city on 21 June.

The Venetian state‚Äîi.e. the medieval Maritime Republic of Venice‚Äîwas often popularly called the \\"Republic of Music\\", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that \\"In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere.\\"Touring Club p. 79 Historical background Map of Venice (historical center) =Introduction= The rich history of music in Venice extends back to the founding of the city in the early Middle Ages, although relatively little is known about music prior to the 15th century. Because of the wide geographical span of its trade relations with both the East and the West, it was continuously influenced by styles that originated in many parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Although Venice bred a great many musicians of rare skill, the Republic frequently searched for talented performers and composers through diplomatic networks. Important chapters in the development of instrumental music were written in Venice: for lute and for organ in the 16th century, for instrumental ensemble in the 17th, and for virtuoso performance in the 18th. The institution of opera theaters, open to a fee-paying public in 1637, followed a long period of private performance before noble audiences of plays with musical numbers. The relationship of these commedie to early opera remain a little-explored area. Festive church music, often performed before the same select audiences as private concerts of instrumental and vocal music, was what many visitors remembered the longest. Even the traditional barcarola tunes sung by Venetian gondoliers developed into an important genre of classical music. The many transformations that Venetian culture underwent in connection with the collapse of the Republic (1797), the turbulence of Napoleonic rule, the strictures of Austrian administration, and the vicissitudes of the Italian state (since 1866) have left their distinct marks on the music made in Venice. Venice has remained an important venue for the gestation of new music through the activities of such composers as Nino Rota, Luigi Nono, and several others. The Veneto continues to breed musicians and ensembles of the highest rank. =Church music= Venice developed a distinctive tradition of church music. There were services with elaborate music at St Mark's Basilica and other buildings in the city. The seminal Venetian composer to emerge from this creative milieu was Claudio Monteverdi (see Vespro della Beata Vergine published in 1610). Others were Andrea Gabrieli and Giovanni Gabrieli, both known for antiphonal compositions of brass music, derived for the acoustics of the Basilica. The Gabrielis established the pinnacle of brass antiphonal effect with double and triple choirs, complete with dynamic markings, and spatial location direction. Brass players to this day remain indebted to the Gabrielis for their contributions to the literature. The Sacrae Symphoniae (1597) and Canzoni (1608) are among the first published works of music. =Opera in Venice= While early opera of the late 1590s was put on for private audiences in Florence, opera as a commercial endeavor started in Venice in the 1630s with performances in the new Teatro Tron in the parish of S. Cassiano, the first opera house ever opened to the public. A second theater, the Teatro di SS. Giovanni e Paolo was also opened for opera. Then in 1640 came the Teatro San Mois√® and in 1641 the Teatro Novissimo. Crucial to the successful beginnings of opera in Venice was the presence of Claudio Monteverdi, whose move to that city from Mantua in 1613 rejuvenated the musical life of Venice. The success of Monteverdi and opera in Venice led directly to the opening of similar theaters elsewhere in Italy. In Naples, for example, the first opera house, the San Bartolomeo Theater, was opened in 1621, when the public was invited to hear the \\"new music from the north\\"‚Äî\\"musica Veneziana\\" (Venetian music). In Venice, the opera season corresponded to the Carnevale‚Äîthat is, the weeks leading up to Lent. Operatic productions decreased a bit in the late 17th century, but picked up as theaters started charging prices that more people could afford. The social function of the opera and the timing of the opera season in Venice go hand in hand. Carnevale was a time of the year when Venice was an international meeting ground, a time when matters besides music were discussed, even at the opera. Theaters were forums for the rich and powerful to discuss the present and the future of the Venetian Republic in its wars against the Turks, for example. =Orphanages= Historically, the four most important \\"hospitals\\" in the Republic of Venice (besides caring for the sick and elderly) were, in fact, orphanages where young children might be taught a useful trade. One of these trades was music; thus, the hospitals developed into true music conservatories of the day. Antonio Vivaldi taught at the Ospedale della Piet√†. (Compare the similar function of Spanish orphanages/conservatories in Naples.) Current venues and activities Interior of La Fenice The best-known opera house in Venice and one of the most famous in the world is La Fenice, built in 1786. After a disastrous fire in 1996, it was rebuilt and is again open. The theater hosts many of the musical events for the Venice Biennale, a running festival of art, music, architecture, dance, cinema and music. The Biennale was started in the 1890s and has developed a reputation as an important venue for modern composers and contemporary music. Other venues for the Biennale are the Teatro Piccolo Arsenale, Teatro alle Tese, and the Teatro Verde. The city has a music conservatory, named after Benedetto MarcelloÔºåIt is the most historic and famous conservatory in Italy. It stems from the 1867 and is currently housed in Palazzo Piani, Its famous alumni include Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari„ÄÅGian Francesco Malipiero„ÄÅToti Dal Monte„ÄÅBruno Maderna„ÄÅLuigi Nono„ÄÅMaria Chiara„ÄÅKatia Ricciarelli„ÄÅLucia Valentini Terrani„ÄÅGiuseppe Sinopoli„ÄÅSara Mingardo„ÄÅLuciana D'intino and many moreÔºåLua prominent villa from the 17th century. The Basilica of San Marco, one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, has had choirmasters since 1318 (!), including names such as Monteverdi. The Sansovino Library is a treasure trove of music manuscripts, including 17th-century opera scores by Francesco Cavalli. Many of Antonio Vivaldi's manuscripts are preserved by the Giorgio Cini foundation in the premises of the Antonio Vivaldi Foundation on the tiny island of San Giorgio. The island is home to a number of other musical foundations and is an important site for classical concerts during the year. One of the most important organizations for music research and preservation is the Ugo and Olga Levi Foundation. The foundation sponsors the Fenice Archives, and its historical documents facilitated the recent restoration of La Fenice opera house. The city also hosts an annual series of lectures and concerts dedicated to composer Richard Wagner. The orchestras Venice has many orchestras of music: Orchestra della Fenice, Rond√≤ Veneziano, Interpreti Veneziani, and Venice Baroque Orchestra.

History Equipment on display The farm was privately owned by a Dutch family, the Adriances, from 1697 to 1808. Their three-room farmhouse, built in 1772, has been restored and still stands. After 1808, a series of families owned the farm as it continued to evolve from a colonial homestead to a modern \\"truck farming\\" or market gardening business. Under its last private farmer, Daniel Stattel, it became, by 1900, \\"the second largest [farm] in size in Queens County and the highest in dollar value...assessed at 32,000 dollars.\\"About the Farm: Series of Owners since 1697 (Queens County Farm Museum) In 1926, the Stattels sold the farm to real estate investor Pauline Reisman, who, in turn, later that year sold it to Creedmoor State Hospital, which used it for occupational therapy, to stock its kitchen, and to grow ornamental plants for the rest of the hospital campus. In 1975, state legislation authored by Frank Padavan transferred ownership of the farm from the hospital to NYC Parks for the purpose of starting a museum.

Dater School, which was a regional K-12 school at the time. The first Ramsey High School was constructed in 1912, with the first commencement held in June 1913. An addition was constructed in 1923. By 1935, additional space was needed, and a new building was proposed to take advantage of funding available through the New Deal-era Public Works Administration. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the new building were held on January 16, 1936, and the \\"New Ramsey High School\\" was dedicated in 1937. With baby boomers filling the school beyond capacity, the school informed its sending districts of Franklin Lakes and Wyckoff that it would no longer accept students from those two communities at the high school beyond the 1956-57 school year, with the two communities joining Oakland to form the Ramapo Indian Hills Regional High School District, which opened its doors in 1957 at Ramapo High School.Staff. \\"Enrollments Tax Schools in Bergen; Auxiliary Rooms Are Being Converted for Classes and Construction Is Pushed\\", The New York Times, September 4, 1954.

Under Uthman, the Muslim armies headed into Armenia for the first time, launching from Syria and led by Habib ibn Maslama al- Fihri. They conquered several Armenian territories but were challenged by large numbers of Byzantines joining the Armenian defense.

A dispute arose between Habib and Salman, and Uthman wrote to them and solved the issue with Salman taking over command of the Muslim armies and being appointed as governor of Armenia. Salman then penetrated deep into Armenia as far as Khazaria with several conquests and victories with his force of 10,000 men.

She published several works under the pseudonyms Monique Saint-Come and Claude Pascal. She is the daughter of literary figure Eugen Lovinescu. She was married to the literary critic Virgil Ierunca. Lovinescu was born in Bucharest. A graduate of the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters, she made her literary debut in Vremea magazine, regularly publishing prose works in Revista Funda≈£iilor Regale and theater chronicles in Democra≈£ia. The rapid steps undertaken towards the establishing of an overtly communist rule in Romania forced her to take refuge in France: going there on a French government-sponsored scholarship in September 1947, she asked (in August 1948) for political asylum after Romania became a People's Republic. She published extensively on the subject of communism in her country, as well as works on Romanian literature. Her articles were frequently featured in prestigious magazines such as Kontinent, Les Cahiers de l'Est, and L'Alternative. She contributed the Romanian chapter of the collection of essays titled Histoire des spectacles (published by √âditions Gallimard). Between 1951 and 1974, Monica Lovinescu was a contributor for Romanian language broadcasts of the Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise, as well as a member of the station's staff for Eastern Europe. From the 1960s onwards, she was a journalist for Radio Free Europe, creating two weekly pieces that were influential in generating an internal opposition to the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu regime. Their main purpose was to inform Romanians of cultural and political trends on in the Free World. Part of the broadcast scripts were published as Unde Scurte (\\"Shortwaves\\"), in Madrid (1978). She was the target of violent attacks in the Romanian communist press, the most notable of them being carried out by journalists Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. In 1977 she was severely beaten by three PLO officers, one disguised as a French mailman, at the direction of Nicolae Ceausescu. Lovinescu also translated several Romanian literary works into French. She died in Paris.

At the age of 23 Harington was an agent of South African military intelligence and was sent to Zimbabwe to infiltrate the African National Congress and send back plans of the organizations' buildings in Harare.South African spy released Arrest and trial Harington was arrested by police and interrogated by the Central Intelligence Organization. At her trial before the Zimbabwe High Court in November 1987 Odile testified that she had been tortured before February 1987 at a place called Daventry House, while she was being held at Mabelreign police station in Harare, and after May 1987 at the CIO detention centre in Goromonzi. She described repeated sexual assaults, severe beatings, burnings with cigarettes and other humiliating treatment. She claimed that an ANC official and her superior had taken part in her torture. According to her testimony, the ANC official beat her on the soles of the feet with a hosepipe and half-drowned her by ducking her head repeatedly in a container of water. This evidence was not challenged in court. Chief Justice Dumbutshena cited her torture in mitigation when he reduced her sentence on appeal. Odile was sentenced to 25 years in jail on 27 November 1987. On 3 December 1987, the South Africa Commissioner of Police said that Odile was not a spy and had not received any training or compensation.

Urban enterprise zone policies generally offer tax concessions, infrastructure incentives, and reduced regulations to attract investments and private companies into the zones. They are a type of special economic zone where companies can locate free of certain local, state, and federal taxes and restrictions. Urban enterprise zones are intended to encourage development in deprived neighborhoods through tax and regulatory relief to entrepreneurs and investors who launch businesses in the area. They are common in the United Kingdom and the United States. In other countries, regions with similar economic policies are often referred as export-procession zones, tax and duty-free zones, and special economic zones (SEZs) most predominantly present in China and India.Derek Gregory, Edited by: Johnston, R.J., Gregory, D., Pratt, G. and Watts, M., The Dictionary of Human Geography, Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, 195 History The 1970s witnessed a shift in city planning, leaving behind post-war Keynesian policies and entering an era of growth machine. Urban planning had thrived during the 1950s and 1960s. Planning was fostered by a period of constant economic and physical growth. The economic recession of the 1970s and 1980s was compelled to transform the nature of urban planning. This shift was especially marked in the UK, when the strong capitalist economy shifted following the great recession. Britain lost its core economic motive: manufacturers.Peter Hall, \\"The City of Enterprise: Planning turned Upside Down: Baltimore, Hong Kong, London, 1975‚Äì2000.\\" in Cities of Tomorrow, 3rd ed. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2002 In an urban context, cities had to create growth at any cost. Due to the stagflation of the economy, the British Centre for Policy Studies and the American Heritage Foundation challenged the theory of Keynesianism which consists of a mixed economy in the private sector accompanied by government interventions and regulations. City planning stopped regulating and controlling growth, and started promoting that growth by any possible means: through tax concession, deregulation, or infrastructure incentives. By encouraging urban growth, city authorities were expecting to boost the economy, reduce unemployment rates, and the progression of decay of its core cities. Theory The enterprise zone concept evolved from a combination of theories, policies and social forces. The philosophy is most closely associated with the theory of supply side economics and the assumption that employers will respond positively to tax incentives and reduced government regulation. The enterprise zone philosophy suggests that by encouraging the production of goods, investment will improve; therefore, the supply of goods and services and the providing of job opportunities will increase accordingly. As policy mechanism, enterprise zones are proposed to stimulate economic activity in decaying areas. When compared with other areas, these areas have higher unemployment rates, lower income level, lower employment opportunities, vacant land, and decayed building and infrastructures. Enterprise zone programs provide the incentives to businesses to overcome economic obstacles that hinder economic growth.Hirasuna, D. & J. Michael. Enterprise Zones: A Review of the Economic Theory and Empirical Evidence. House Research Department. January 2005 In the United States The United States experienced transition similar to the UK in the 1970s. The industrial regions of New England, the northern Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were facing economic restructuring, overseas competition and profit loss. During the 1970s, it is estimated that 38 million jobs were lost due to the relocations of industries, closure, and cutbacks, and as much as 35 million were located in the industrial regions. For the regeneration, it took urban planners, politicians and economists to challenge Keynesianism and introduce Enterprise zones.Bluestone, B. and Harrison, B. 1982: the desindustrialisation of America, Plant Closure, Community Abandonment, and the dismantling of Basic Industry. New York: Basic Books. Urban revitalisation heavily influenced enterprise zones in the USA. Urban revitalisation consisted of innovative partnerships between different government levels and the private sector. The concept mainly consisted of accepting the end of the industrial-led economy and transforming the role of the inner city to a service sector economy. This revitalisation of the inner city would attract young professionals to the decaying Victorian downtown neighborhoods. This would create a new economic base to the city. In New Jersey, for example, a municipality may request that the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, part of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs designate part of a city, usually about 30%, as a UEZ. UEZs are usually located in the industrial and/or commercial portions of a city, within a continuous boundary. A 50% reduction in the general Sales tax rate (from 6.625% to 3.3125% as of January 1, 2018) and hiring incentives, are designed to reinvigorate the business climate within the Zone. These incentives have led to the construction of numerous malls and big-box retailers in parts of the development zone located near major highways, such as the Elizabeth Center and Jersey Gardens Outlet Center in the largely industrial city of Elizabeth along the New Jersey Turnpike. Among New Jersey's 565 municipalities, 27 now participate in the program.Urban Enterprise Zone Program, State of New Jersey.

A persistence of low-wage jobs, rapid turnover of the firms, little inward investment, or persistent subsidy to enterprise, would not indicate a successful transition. =United Kingdom= In the UK, a government- commissioned evaluation in 1987 found that from 1981‚Äì86, the enterprise zones had cost nearly ¬£300 million but 2,800 firms were established in them, employing over 63,000 people. Taking local transfers into account (a notable example being the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in the West Midlands, which largely consisted of shops which had relocated from the nearby town of Dudley), only 13,000 net jobs had been created; a possible reason why the government began to prefer urban development corporations as their main vehicle for urban renewal.Hall, P. (2002) Urban and Regional Planning. Fourth Edition. London: Routledge However, a notable success has been the London Docklands, largely derelict and with unsatisfactory transport infrastructure thirty years ago when a zone was first established, now a financial and media powerhouse. In fact, the London situation is example of dual long-lasting special zones. The City of London was for years a special region in London, being one of the early examples of it. Despite this, after London lost its port status because of technology and rising prices, the created revival vision London Docklands was in fact creation of second nearby special zone; mainly populated with financial companies, that hundreds of years ago would have chosen the City, but now instead chosen Docklands, while the City is slowly converting to tourist heritage park (one of examples is the Stock Exchange Building, where the London Stock Exchange moved away, and it was converted to the tourist-luxury shopping centre), and for example car owners and parking spaces are limited, with extra payment just for \\"entry\\", during the working week which is not endorsed by private-public owning of Docklands, which also approves new buildings containing itself lot of working places and vehicle parking spaces.http://www.finance-interns.com/advice-and- support/history-of-the-square- milehttp://www.citymayors.com/government/london_corp.htmlhttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/163692.article In 2012, the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government designated 24 new enterprise zones in England, and then extended the list to 44 in 2015. =United States= The Evansville, Indiana Enterprise Zone Program was established in 1984 as one of Indiana's first five enterprise zones. A study published in 1989 by Barry M. Rubin and Margaret G. Wilder examined the 2.1 mi.2 area using the technique of shift-share analysis to determine whether the zone was having a measurable impact on local economic development. (The choice to use the shift-share analysis method with the larger metropolitan area as the reference region allowed Rubin & Wilder to go a step further than previous studies and exclude \\"external effects\\" that might be stimulating or depressing regional economic growth and development.) The study found that the Evansville zone did provide significant employment growth that could not be accounted for by external effects or the industrial composition of the zone itself. The zone was also found to be extremely cost-effective in its job creation.Rubin, Barry M., Margaret G. Wilder, \\"Urban Enterprise Zones: Employment Impacts and Fiscal Incentives.\\" Journal of the American Planning Association, Autumn, 1989. Overall, the consensus on the effectiveness of enterprise zones in the US is mixed at best. Lambert and Coomes (2001) found that the Louisville, Kentucky enterprise zone mostly benefited large corporations rather than small entrepreneurs and did not benefit local neighborhoods at all, even though community re-development was a goal. More importantly, in a book that reviewed most major enterprise zone studies done in the 1980s and 1990s as well as conducting its own original work, Peters and Fisher (2002) consider most state and local enterprise zone programs to have come up short in achieving their goals and objectives.

The main set of three rulebooks was followed by several separately published adventures and supplements for the game, which provided details about the Daleks, the Cybermen and the Master. The supplements contained two pamphlets, one for players and another for game masters.  History  The game came out in two printings, one showing painted artwork of the Fourth Doctor and Leela the other a publicity photograph of them. Neither the Fourth Doctor or Leela, at that date, still appeared in the series. The painting printing had interior rulebooks with slick white covers, while the photographic edition featured more textured brown Victorian-styled rulebooks. FASA also published two solo play gamebooks: Doctor Who and the Vortex Crystal (1986) by William H.

This game is totally unrelated to the previously released Doctor Who RPG by FASA, having different and simpler mechanics that often seemed arbitrary. For example, the companion Polly is a secretary yet according to her statistics, she can hardly read or write. The system lacked any method for creating original player characters: it was suggested that the referee give the players a particular Doctor and his associated companions, or a group of Doctors. A later on-line supplement, \\"Timelord: Journeys\\", written by Nathaniel Torson, provided a system for creating original player characters. A variety of basic templates were provided (\\"The Soldier,\\" \\"The Specialist,\\" The Alien\\") and die roll ranges provided for determining attribute and skill values. Rules for purchasing alien abilities, generating random adventures, and using \\"Drama Points\\" to increase abilities and use Genre Tropes to simulate standard situations from the series were also provided. The game was marketed with other Doctor Who books instead of other role-playing games. It was printed in paperback novel format, unlike other RPGs. In addition, Virgin was unknown in the gaming market. As a result, it did not sell well and aside from a few articles in Doctor Who Magazine, no supplements were published. The system revolves around the concept of \\"beating the difference\\" - Actions have a difficulty rating, from which the relevant attribute and skill is subtracted; the remaining number is the difference. Players roll two six-sided dice, and then take the difference of the two rolls; if that number is higher than the difference, the action is successful. The game includes many skills which are especially appropriate to the tone of Doctor Who, such as cheat death and macguffin. The original game book includes extensive biographical information on all the companions of the TV series, as well as many of the villains. Also included is an incomplete original short story, \\"The Necromancers\\", with the idea the story could be completed as part of a game campaign. The text includes a solo adventure, Switchback. A full campaign, The Templar Throne, is also included. It takes place in a shopping mall. In 1996, the game was made available for free on the internet, along with updates for the game to include the Eighth Doctor.

As of 2014, there are at least 33 US graduate employee unions, 18 unrecognized unions in the US, and 23 graduate employee unions in Canada.Coalition of Graduate Student Employees. Retrieved on November 26, 2014 Almost all US graduate employee unions are located in public universities, most of which formed during the 1990s. In 2014, New York University's Graduate Student Organizing Committee, affiliated with the United Automobile Workers (UAW), became the first graduate employee union recognized by a private university in the US. In September 2018, Brandeis University became the second private university to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for graduate student employees, followed by Tufts University in October 2018 and Harvard in July 2020. American University and New School were in the process of negotiating an agreement as of September 2018. Many of these unions refer to their workers as Academic Student Employees (ASEs) to reflect the fact that their membership may also include undergraduate students working in represented job classifications. In 2019, the NLRB proposed a new rule that said graduate students are not employees, which could affect unionization efforts at private universities, although the final rule has yet to be published. Labor laws in the United States and Canada permit collective bargaining for only limited classes of student-employees. In the US, public and private institutions have different authorities governing collective bargaining rights. In public universities, state labor laws determine collective bargaining and employee recognition. In private universities, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has power to determine whether graduate students are considered employees, which would give them collective bargaining rights. The NLRB ruled that graduate students at private universities are employees in a 3‚Äì1 decision on August 23, 2016, setting the stage for widespread unionization efforts at universities such as Columbia, University of Chicago, Duke, Yale, Cornell, and Harvard. In the U.S., many university administrators and university associations like the Association of American Universities have vigorously opposed the unionization of graduate student employees on their campuses through legal challenges on the grounds that unionization threatens academic freedom of institutions and harms the relationship between faculty and students, although recent research suggests that unionization neither negatively affects academic freedom nor harms faculty-student relationships. Many faculty associations like the American Association of University Professors support the right of graduate students to form unions. In Finland and Sweden, for instance, graduate students are often regular employees and are represented by their respective professional unions, such as member unions of Akava in Finland. United States The main issue over graduate student employee unionization in the United States is whether academic student employees should be classified as employees or students, because the recognition of employee status would give graduate students the right to form a union and to bargain collectively. The position of many universities is that the work graduate student employees do is so intertwined with their professional education that collective bargaining will harm the educational process. Supporters of unionization argue that graduate employees' work is primarily an economic relationship. They point especially to universities' use of Teaching Assistants as part of a wider trend away from full-time, tenured faculty. For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service considers the compensation of graduate student employees to be wages. When graduate students receive payment for teaching, it is not taxed on a 1042-S form (for scholarships), but on a W-2 (which is the form for employment income). The income from teaching is taxed differently from scholarships, and treated like employment income. =Public universities= Academic student employees who may be either graduate or undergraduate students at public colleges and universities in the United States are covered by state collective bargaining laws, where these laws exist. Graduate students employees are excluded from Federal bargaining rights under the Taft-Hartley Act's exclusion of state and local government employees. The various state laws differ on which subgroups of academic student employees may bargain collectively, and a few state laws explicitly exclude them from bargaining. Some states have extended collective bargaining rights to graduate employees in response to unionization campaigns. As of 2004, 14 states including California and New York explicitly give collective bargaining rights to academic student employees; 11 states like Connecticut and New Mexico give public university employees the right to collectively bargain, but leaves eligibility for graduate employees unstated; Ohio is the only state to exclude collective bargaining rights for graduate student employees while still providing the same rights to other university employees; and 23 states deny collective bargaining rights for all university employees. =Private universities= Graduate student employees at private colleges and universities in the United States are covered by the National Labor Relations Act. Initially, the NLRB rejected all private university employees including academic employees from being protected by the NLRA. In the Trustees of Columbia (1951) decision, the NLRB held that the act did not have jurisdiction in private universities because universities focus primarily on education and are not associated with significant commercial activity. However, two decades later in Cornell v NLRB (1970), the NLRB reversed Columbia, holding that due to changing economic realities and difficulties in distinguishing between commercial and noncommercial activities in private universities, the NLRA covers employees in private education institutions. For the employee status of academic student employees, the NLRB's rulings have shifted in recent decades. In these decisions, the NLRB has grappled with two main conflicting legal arguments. The \\"primary purpose\\" approach holds that graduate students are not employees because the primary purpose of graduate students is to fulfill the role of a student rather than that of an employee. In contrast, the \\"compensated services\\" approach holds that graduate students are employees because they perform services for others and have distinct manager-worker relations with university administrators. The \\"primary purpose\\" doctrine was first applied to graduate students in Adelphi University and Adelphi University Chapter, American Association of University Professors (1972) (Adelphi University) decision, in which the NLRB rejected graduate teaching and research assistants from collectively bargaining with faculty. After years of rejecting employee status to graduate students, the NLRB overturned the Adelphi University (1972) decision. Under New York University and International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFL-CIO (2000) (NYU), the NLRB applied the \\"compensated services\\" legal approach, ruling for the first time that graduate students at private universities were considered employees, and hence protected by the NLRA. However, the NLRB later returned to its \\"primary purpose\\" approach in 2004 after a new Republican-appointed majority reversed NYU. In Brown University and International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW AFL- CIO (2004) (Brown University), the NLRB's 3‚Äì2 majority ruled that graduate students in private universities are not considered employees. In recent years, NYU's graduate student union filed a case seeking to overturn Brown University, which in 2012 the NLRB announced that it would reconsider. However, NYU's graduate student union later agreed to withdraw its NLRB petition in return for union recognition by the private university. On December 17 2014, graduate student unions affiliated with UAW at both Columbia University and The New School have filed petitions at the NLRB to overturn the Brown decision. History =Beginnings (1960s‚Äì1979)= Graduate student unionization began mostly in the late 1960s, influenced heavily by the New Left Movement and the UC Berkeley Free Speech Movement. The two movements sparked discussions on university democracy and students' relationship with the university. Throughout this period, only public university graduate students were able to form recognized unions. Although graduate students in private colleges were active in union organizing campaigns, they were greatly restricted by the Columbia (1951) and later Adelphi University (1972) decisions, which both barred the NLRA from protecting graduate students in private universities. The board ruled that graduate assistants were not employees since their relationship is primarily for learning purposes.Adelphi University 195 NLRB 638, 1972. Teaching assistants at Rutgers University and the City University of New York (CUNY) were the first to be included under a collective bargaining agreement.

University of Massachusetts, Amherst was an exception. There, 2,500 graduate assistants won recognition in November 1990 and a contract the following year that covered teaching, research and project assistants, and assistant residence directors. Teaching assistants at the University at Buffalo began a union campaign in 1975, but withdrew their petition to the State of New York Public Employee Relations Board (PERB). Other campuses from the State of New York University System, such as Albany, Binghamton, and Stony Brook, revived the union petition in 1984. Similarly, teaching assistants at the University of California at Berkeley started a union campaign in 1983. Eventually in 1993, exam readers and tutors, but not graduate assistants, were given collective bargaining rights at Berkeley. Full collective bargaining status to all teaching assistants was not given until 1999. =Aggressive growth (1990‚Äì2004)= The 1990s brought about more aggressive and successful union drives in both public and private universities, which culminated in the NLRB's NYU (2000) decision, granting employee status and collective bargaining rights to private university graduate students. The number of unionized graduate employees nearly tripled from 14,060 unionized graduate students in 1990 to 38,750 graduate students in 2001. Labor unions began more active efforts in providing support and resources for student unionization drives. The new 1995 leadership of the AFL-CIO created a summer program in 1996 to train student union organizers and reached out to students by sending its Organizing Institute recruiters onto college campuses. Additionally, national attention turned towards academic labor and unionization efforts. Journalist Scott Smallwood announced 2001 to be the ‚ÄúYear of the TA‚Äù following unionization victories in NYU, Temple University, and Michigan State University. Like the previous decades, the vast majority of graduate employee unions formed were from public universities. Despite aggressive unionizing drives in private universities like Yale, only NYU's graduate students obtained union recognition following the NYU decision. In 1991, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee won recognition for a graduate-student union. Shortly thereafter, the University of Albany, Buffalo, Binghamton, and Stony Brook won recognition when the State of New York PERB ruled teaching assistants were employees and were granted collective bargaining rights. Several other public universities also won recognition in the 1990s. In 1995, the University of Kansas GTA union won their election, and signed their first union contract in 1997. Teaching and research assistants at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell and the University of Iowa approved a union contract in 1996. Wayne State University also negotiated a contract with teaching assistants in 1999. Besides SUNY, the University of California system was the second university system to unionize. In 1999, the California PERB ruled teaching assistants were allowed to collectively bargain with the University of California. Union elections were held at the University of California's Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Riverside, and Irvine campuses‚Äîall of them approving a teaching assistant union. In 2000, union negotiations for all of the campuses were combined into UAW Local 2865, who bargains on behalf of all the campuses. Teaching assistants at the University of California, Merced also joined the union when the campus opened in 2006. Several notable unionization efforts arose at private universities. Although pre-NYU-rulings by the NLRB did not permit graduate students to unionize at private universities, they also did not prohibit universities from recognizing unions. Teaching assistant unions formed at Yale and New York University. To gain bargaining status, the unions went on several strikes and led long union drive campaigns. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Yale graduate students organized a sustained union drive campaign, which remains ongoing. In response to poor pay and working conditions, Yale‚Äôs graduate students formed Teaching Assistant Solidarity in 1987, which later became the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO) in 1990. Students orchestrated multiple strikes to gain union recognition. GESO orchestrated a one-day walkout in December 1991 and a three- day strike in February 1992. Additionally, Yale graduate students participated in a walkout on April 6, 1995 to demand union recognition. Despite a later 600‚Äì120 vote in favor of union representation, the university refused to negotiate a contract. In 1996, teaching assistants at Yale refused to calculate and submit fall semester grades. The administration still refused to recognize the union and the strike eventually ended. A suit was filed by the NLRB on behalf of the striking Yale students claiming Yale's administration violated unfair-labor-practice law; however, a judge later dismissed the suit. GESO participated in a five-day strike along with other unions in Yale University on March 2003 for better wages and pensions and demand for union recognition. However, in a union voting drive the following May, Yale graduate students rejected unionization by a narrow 694-651 margin. In 2000, the National Labor Relations Board reversed their previous rulings on unionization at private universities and permitted graduate assistants at New York University (NYU) to unionize. Later that year, graduate assistants at NYU signed their first and only contract. Since 2000, more than twenty campuses have unionized. In 2001, the University of Massachusetts Boston signed their first contract with teaching and research assistants while Oregon State University won a contract‚Äîthe second to receive a contract in Oregon. In 2002, Michigan State University and Temple University unionized. Despite a state law explicitly denying graduate assistants from unionizing, the Washington PERB ruled graduate assistants at the University of Washington could unionize. The University of Rhode Island also unionized that year. =Brown era (2004‚Äì2016)= In 2004, the NLRB again reversed itself and prohibited Brown University and other private universities from unionizing.Brown University 342 NLRB 42, 2004 Unionization drives after 2004 are mostly characterized by a slowing of momentum in organizing activity, particularly in private universities. The NLRB‚Äôs Brown decision in 2004 reversed the legal protections and collective bargaining rights that, under NYU, had covered graduate students in private universities. As a result, private university union drives have stalled in the courts in attempts to reverse the Brown decision. Graduate students in public universities, however, have continued to unionize.

Following the NLRB's Brown (2004) decision, NYU refused to bargain with the NYU graduate union after the expiration of their contract in 2005. Despite a 2005‚Äì06 strike, NYU graduate student employees union were not able to obtain union recognition. In April 2010, more than 1,000 NYU graduate assistants again filed an election petition with the NLRB. NLRB Acting Regional 2 Director Elbert F. Tellem denied the petition, deferring to the NLRB's 2004 decision in Brown University. But in language highly critical of Brown, Tellem observed that \\"The instant record clearly shows that these graduate assistants are performing services under the control and direction of\\" New York University \\"for which they are compensated. It is also clear on the record that these services remain an integral component of graduate education.\\" Tellem criticized Brown University for being \\"premised on a university setting as it existed 30 years ago\\", and said that \\"The graduates have a dual relationship with the employer which does not necessarily preclude a finding of employee status.\\" The New York Times said the Region 2 decision \\"lays the groundwork to overturn the 2004 ruling,\\" and other media outlets agreed.Berrett, Dan. \\"A Debate Reopened.\\" Inside Higher Ed. June 21, 2011. Accessed 2011-07-28 NYU graduate students later filed a petition to overturn Brown University, which the NLRB agreed to review in 2012. The case was withdrawn in 2013, however, in an agreement with the university to regain union recognition. Two new petitions seeking to overturn Brown University were filed at the NLRB by the graduate student unions of Columbia University and The New School on Dec 17, 2014. Recently, the NLRB has ruled research assistants at private, but university-affiliated, research centers for SUNY and CUNY are permitted to unionize.Research Foundation of the State University of New York . 350 NLRB, 2007.Research Foundation of the City University of New York . 350 NLRB, 2007 = Post-Columbia era (2016‚Äìpresent) = On August 23, 2016, the NLRB reversed the 2004 Brown decision and ruled that student assistants are protected by the NLRA. https://www.nlrb.gov/news- outreach/news-story/board-student-assistants-covered-nlra-0].\\" NLRB, 2016 Columbia was followed by a resurgence of graduate students calling for elections, with eight schools winning graduate union recognition votes since the decision. Unionization attempts since Columbia have been characterized by rapid establishment at the onset, followed by extensive internal challenges by the universities at which they are formed. This reversal of Board case law has led to recent challenges within the administrations of higher-ed institutions. Nine universities, including Brown University, filed an amicus brief in 2016 in the challenge to the Columbia decision opposing graduate student unionization. Filed due to their positions that graduate students should not be classified as employees under the NLRA as well as an unavoidable and undue imposition on the academic freedoms of their students, universities have undertaken greater and greater measures to oppose unionization on their campuses. Causes of unionization Academic student unionization is seen by some academics as a response to the growing corporatization of universities. Many graduate students and union officers actively critique privatization of the academy and point to privatization of the university as a major factor in choosing to unionize. Unionization has also been attributed to increased teaching workloads and financial difficulties imposed on graduate students, as since the 1970s universities have transferred more instruction tasks from tenure track faculty to adjunct faculty and graduate students as cost saving measures. This is also in combination with the increased tuition and higher cost of living, the prospect of having to pay off an increasing loan debt, and poor job opportunities. Graduate students became more inclined to recognize themselves as employees, and turned towards unionization to better demand bread and butter issues such as increased stipends or wages and benefits such as health insurance and child care. Additionally, increased labor union activity in academic sectors has played a key role in graduate employee unionization. During the sizable growth in the 1990s, graduate students were better able to access legal support, financial resources, and networking opportunities provided by the new leadership in the AFL-CIO and by unions such as UAW. The newly elected 1995 AFL-CIO leadership engaged college students by creating a Union Summer Internships program in 1996 to train students in union organizing. The AFL-CIO also sent Organizing Institute recruiters onto college campuses to build pro-labor solidarity networks and share information with student organizers about other universities' organizing efforts. Similarly, UAW plays a significant role in supporting graduate student organizers, some of whom see UAW as the most responsive union to academic student employees' needs in comparison with traditional education unions.Smallwood, S. (2003). United Auto(or Is That 'Academic'?) Workers. The Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved on November 25th 2014 UAW has won affiliations of important student bodies such as graduate student employees in the UC system and in NYU. Support and criticism Some graduate students, notably organizers in the union local UAW 2865 representing UC student workers, believe graduate employee unions empower students and gives potential to expand bargaining to items outside of the usual economic benefits or job security.Haider, A. (2014). The Power of Grad Students. Inside Higher Ed.

Retrieved on November 26th 2014. Many institutions that represent faculty and teachers such as the American Association of University Professors and the National Education Association support graduate students‚Äô right to join a union and to bargain collectively. Many university administrators and higher education- related associations and corporations like the American Council on Education and the Association of American Universities oppose graduate student unionization.Schmidt, P. (2012). College Leaders and Labor Organizers Spat over Possible Graduate Student Unionization. The Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved on November 26th 2014 They argue that unionization threatens academic freedom of institutions by making education policies subject to collective bargaining and harms the relationship between professors and students due to possible conflicts arising from the bargaining process. However, recent research suggests that unionization has either no impact or a weak positive impact to both academic freedom and faculty-student relationships.

With signing the Prespa Agreement, Greece accepted the name Macedonian language in reference to the official language of North Macedonia. Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian. However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem of the Macedonian language by signing a Joint Declaration in the official languages of the two countries - in Macedonian, pursuant to Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia, and in Bulgarian, pursuant the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. Macedonian dialects form a continuum with Bulgarian dialects forming the Eastern South Slavic sub-group; they in turn form a broader continuum with Serbo-Croatian through the transitional Torlakian dialects. The Macedonian language was standardized in 1945 based on the central-western dialects of the region of Macedonia.Matthew H. Ciscel, Multilingualism and the disputed standardizations of Macedonian and Moldovan, pp. 309‚Äì328; in Matthias H√ºning, Ulrike Vogl, Olivier Moliner as ed., Standard Languages and Multilingualism in European History, John Benjamins Publishing, 2012, , p. 314. Overview of issues =Recognition= The front page of the Abecedar, a school book published by the Greek government in 1925. Attempts to use Macedonian-language books in the Greek educational system were largely unsuccessful. Politicians and scholars from North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Greece have opposing views about the existence and distinctiveness of the Macedonian language. Through history and especially before its codification, Macedonian has been referred to as a variant of Bulgarian, Serbian or a distinct language of its own.Max K. Adler. Marxist Linguistic Theory and Communist Practice: A Sociolinguistic Study; Buske Verlag (1980), p.215 Historically, after its codification, the use of the language has been a subject of different views in Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece. In the interwar period, Macedonian was treated as a South Serbian dialect in Yugoslavia in accordance with claims made in the 19th century but the government permitted its use in dialectal literature. The 1940s saw opposing views on the Macedonian language in Bulgaria; while its existence was recognized in 1946-47 and allowed as the language of instruction in schools in Pirin Macedonia, the period after 1948 saw its rejection and restricted domestic use. Until 1999, Macedonian had never been recognized as a minority language in Greece and attempts to have Macedonian-language books introduced in education have failed. For instance, a Macedonian primer Abecedar was published in 1925 in Athens but was never used and eventually, most copies were destroyed. Professor Christina Kramer argues that Greek policies have largely been based on denying connection between the Macedonian codified standard and that of the Slavophone minority in the country and sees it as \\"clearly directed towards the elimination of Macedonian\\". The number of speakers of Macedonian in Greece has been difficult to establish since part of the Slavophone Greek population is also considered speakers of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists. In recent years, there have been attempts to have the language recognized as a minority language in Greece. In Albania, Macedonian was recognized after 1946 and mother-tongue instructions were offered in some village schools until grade four. =Autonomous language dispute= Bulgarian scholars have and continue to widely consider Macedonian part of the Bulgarian dialect area. In many Bulgarian and international sources before the World War II, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's North Macedonia and Northern Greece was referred to as a group of Bulgarian dialects. Some scholars argue that the idea of linguistic separatism emerged in the late 19th century with the advent of Macedonian nationalism and the need for a separate Macedonian standard language subsequently appeared in the early 20th century. Local variants used to name the language were also balg√†rtzki, b√πgarski or bug√†rski; i.e. Bulgarian. Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regarded the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian. Dialect experts of the Bulgarian language refer to the Macedonian language as –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –µ–∑–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞ i.e. Macedonian linguistic norm of the Bulgarian language. In 1999 the government in Sofia signed a Joint Declaration in the official languages of the two countries, marking the first time it agreed to sign a bilateral agreement written in Macedonian. As of 2019, disputes regarding the language and its origins are ongoing in academic and political circles in the countries. Macedonian is still widely regarded as a dialect by Bulgarian scholars, historians and politicians alike including the Government of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, which denies the existence of a separate Macedonian language and declares it a written regional form of the Bulgarian language. Similar sentiments are also expressed by the majority of the Bulgarian population. The current international consensus outside of Bulgaria is that Macedonian is an autonomous language within the Eastern South Slavic dialect continuum. As such, the language is recognized by 138 countries of the United Nations. =Naming dispute= The Greek scientific and local community was opposed to using the denomination Macedonian to refer to the language in light of the Greek-Macedonian naming dispute. The term is often avoided in the Greek context, and vehemently rejected by most Greeks, for whom Macedonian has very different connotations. Instead, the language is often called simply \\"Slavic\\" or \\"Slavomacedonian\\" (translated to \\"Macedonian Slavic\\" in English). Speakers themselves variously refer to their language as makedonski, makedoniski (\\"Macedonian\\"),Lois Whitman (1994): Denying ethnic identity: The Macedonians of Greece Helsinki Human Rights Watch. p.39 slavik√° (, \\"Slavic\\"), d√≥pia or ent√≥pia (, \\"local/indigenous [language]\\"), balg√†rtzki (Bulgarian) or \\"Macedonian\\" in some parts of the region of Kastoria, b√≤gartski (\\"Bulgarian\\") in some parts of Dolna Prespa along with na≈°i (\\"our own\\") and stariski (\\"old\\"). With the Prespa agreement signed in 2018 between the Government of North Macedonia and the Government of Greece, the latter country accepted the use of the adjective Macedonian to refer to the language using a footnote to describe it as Slavic.  Historical overview  Marko Teodorrovich's Primer, 1792 Ioakim Karchovski's vernacular book, 1814 Konikovo Gospel, 1852 Kulakia Gospel, 1863 Bulgarian ethnos in Macedonia existed long before the earliest articulations of the idea that Macedonian Slavs might form a separate ethnic group from the Bulgarians in Danubian Bulgaria and Thrace. Throughout the period of Ottoman rule, the Slav-speaking people of the geographic regions of Moesia, Thrace and Macedonia referred to their language as Bulgarian and called themselves Bulgarians.Verkoviƒá, Stjepan Narodne pesme makedonski bugara (Folk Songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians). Beograd, 1860.Miladinov, D. and Miladinov, K. Bulgarian Folk Songs (–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏). Zagreb, 1861. For instance, the Serbian Bosnian researcher Stjepan Verkoviƒá who was a long-term teacher in Macedonia sent by the Serbian government with a special assimilatory mission wrote in the preface of his collection of Bulgarian folk songs: \\"I named these songs Bulgarian, and not Slavic because today when you ask any Macedonian Slav: Who are you? he immediately answers: I am Bulgarian and call my language Bulgarian‚Ä¶\\"\\"–ù–æ —ò–∞ —Å–∞–º –æ–≤–µ –ø–µ—Å–º–µ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–æ –±—É–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–º–∞, –∞ –Ω–µ —Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º–∞, –∑–±–æ–≥ —Ç–æ–≥–∞, —ò–µ—Ä –¥–∞–Ω–∞—Å –∫–∞–¥ –±–∏ –∫–æ–≥–æ–¥ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥ –°–ª–∞–≤–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–∞ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç–∞–æ: —à—Ç–æ —Å–∏ —Ç–∏? —Å –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –±–∏ –º—É –æ—Ç–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–Ω–æ: —è —Å–∞–º –±–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω, –∞ —Å–≤–æ—ò —ò–µ–∑–∏–∫ –∑–æ–≤—É –±–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–º...\\", p. 13 The name \\"Bulgarian\\" for various Macedonian dialects can be seen from early vernacular texts such as the four-language dictionary of Daniil of Moschopole, the early works of Kiril Pejchinovich and Ioakim Kurchovski and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the Bulgarian vernacular were registered in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.Prof. Dr. Gustav Weigand, ETHNOGRAPHIE VON MAKEDONIEN, Geschichtlich-nationaler, spraechlich-statistischer Teil, Leipzig, Friedrich Brandstetter, 1924. The first samples of Bulgarian speech and the first grammar of modern Bulgarian language were written by the leading Serbian literator Vuk Karad≈æiƒá on the basis of the Macedonian Razlog dialect.Vuk Karadjiƒá. Dodatak k sanktpeterburgskim sravniteljnim rjeƒçnicima sviju jezika i narjeƒçja sa osobitim ogledom Bugarskog —ò–µ–∑–∏–∫–∞. Vienna, 1822. In those early years the re-emerging Bulgarian written language was still heavily influenced by Church Slavonic forms so dialectical differences were not very prominent between the Eastern and Western regions. Indeed, in those early years many Bulgarian activists sometimes even communicated in Greek in their writing. When the Bulgarian national movement got under way in the second quarter of the 19th century some cities in Macedonia were among the first to demand education in Bulgarian and Bulgarian-speaking clerics for their churches.F. A. K. Yasamee \\"NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS\\" in Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order, Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132. By the 1860s however, it was clear that the Central Balkan regions of Bulgaria were assuming leadership in linguistic and literary affairs. This was to a large extent due to the fact that the wealthy towns on both sides of the Central Balkan range were able to produce more intellectuals educated in Europe than the relatively more backward other Bulgarian regions. Consequently, when the idea that the vernacular rather than Church Slavonic should be represented in the written language gained preponderance, it was the dialects of the Central Balkan region between Veliko Tarnovo and Plovdiv that were most represented.–°—Ç—Ä—É–∫–æ–≤–∞, –ö. –ü. –û–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–µ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ 50-70-–µ –≥–≥ XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏—è –Ω–∞—É–∫, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞ 2004, —Å—Ç—Ä. 85-136. Some prominent Bulgarian educators from Macedonia like Parteniy Zografski and Kuzman Shapkarev called for a stronger representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian literary language but their advice was not heeded at the time and sometimes met with hostility. In the article The Macedonian Question by Petko Rachev Slaveykov, published on 18 January 1871 in the Makedoniya newspaper in Constantinople, Macedonism was criticized, his adherents were named Macedonists, and this is the earliest surviving indirect reference to it, although Slaveykov never used the word Macedonism.The term's first recorded use is from 1887 by Stojan Novakoviƒá to describe Macedonism as a potential ally for the Serbian strategy to expand its territory toward Macedonia, whose population was regarded by almost all neutral sources as Bulgarian at the time. The consternation of certain Macedonians with what they saw as the domineering attitude of Northern Bulgarians towards their vernacular was later deftly exploited by the Serbian state, which had begun to fear the rise of Bulgarian nationalism in Macedonia. Up until 1912/18 it was the standard Bulgarian language that most Macedonians learned (and taught) in the Exarchate schools. All activists and leaders of the Macedonian movement, including those of the left, used standard Bulgarian in documents, press publications, correspondence and memoirs and nothing indicates they viewed it as a foreign language.–ö–∞–∫ –ø–∏—à–µ—Ö–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –±—É–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –∏ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–∏, –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤ This is characteristic even of the members of IMRO (United) well into the 1920s and 1930s, when the idea of a distinct Macedonian nation was taking shape.–î–∏–º–∏—Ç—ä—Ä –í–ª–∞—Ö–æ–≤ –ë–æ—Ä–±–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥ –∑–∞ –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ, –ë–∏–±–ª–∏–æ—Ç–µ–∫–∞ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è, ‚Ññ 1, –í–∏–µ–Ω–∞; Dimitar Vlahov, \\"The liberation struggle of the Macedonian people\\" From the 1930s onwards the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Comintern sought to foster a separate Macedonian nationality and language as a means of achieving autonomy for Macedonia within a Balkan federation.

Since the latter held most of the political power, they managed to impose their views on the direction the new language was to follow, much to the dismay of the former group.Palmer, S. and R. King, Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question, Archon Books, 1971, p. 137. Dennis P. Hupchick, American professor of history, states that \\"the obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the socialist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian\\".Dennis P. Hupchick, Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe, Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, p. 143 After 1944 the communist-dominated government sought to create a Bulgarian-Yugoslav federation (see Balkan Communist Federation) and part of this entailed giving \\"cultural autonomy\\" to the Pirin region. Consequently, Bulgarian communists recognised the Macedonian language as distinct from Bulgarian on 2nd Nov 1944 with a letter from the Bulgarian Workers' Party (communists) to Marshal Tito and CPY.\\"Especially in view of the establishment of a free Macedonian state within the framework of a federal Yugoslavia, making the first appropriate step for the realization of the Macedonian ideal of emancipation, a united Macedonia, we would like to inform you that our Party and our people most sincerely welcome the new Macedonian state.\\" The full text of the letter:A letter from the Centarl Committee of the Bulgarian Workers' Party to Tito From January 1945 the regional newspaper Pirinsko Delo printed in Bulgaria started to publish a page in Macedonian language.http://www.librev.com/index.php/2013-03-30-08-56-39/discussion/bulgaria/2127-from- internationalism-to-nationalism-1Mahon, M. (1998) \\"The Macedonian question in Bulgaria\\" in Nations and Nationalism. Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 389-407 After the Tito-Stalin split in 1948, those plans were abandoned. This date also coincided with the first claims of Bulgarian linguists as to the Serbianisation of the Macedonian language.Friedman, V. (1998) \\"The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results\\" in International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Issue 131. pp. 31-57 Officially Bulgaria continued to support the idea of a Macedonian unification and a Macedonian nation but within the framework of a Balkan Federation and not within Yugoslavia.Palmer and King, p. 126 However, a reversal in the Macedonisation policy was already announced in the secret April plenum of the BCP in 1956 and openly proclaimed in the plenum of 1963. 1958 was the first time that a \\"serious challenge\\" to the Macedonian position was launched by Bulgaria.Palmer and King, p. 163. These developments led to violent polemics between Yugoslav and Bulgarian scholars and sometimes reflected on the bilateral relations of the two countries.  Macedonian view  According to the Macedonian view, now prevalent and official in the books in Republic of North Macedonia, Macedonian was the first official language of the Slavs, thanks to the St. Cyril and St. Methodius's introduction of Slavic literacy language through the Glagolitic script, that was based on Southern Macedonian dialect from the neighbourhood of Thessaloniki, the home of the two saints.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Old Church Slavonic language Later on, Macedonia fell under the rule of Bulgarians, and the Byzantines regarded all Slavic Macedonians as Bulgarians. According to a minority view, supported in the Republic of North Macedonia, Tsar Samuil's realm in the early Middle Ages was allegedly the first Macedonian Slavic state. However, Krste Misirkov, who allegedly set the principles of the Macedonian literary language in the late 19th century, stated: \\"We speak a Bulgarian language and we believed with Bulgaria is our strong power.\\"Misirkov, K. \\"On the Macedonian Matters\\", Sofia 1903 During the time of the Ottoman Empire, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Greece were all under Ottoman reign. During the nineteenth century, the primary source of identity was religion. Because Slavs in the geographical regions of Macedonia and Bulgaria were both Orthodox Christian and the Greek Orthodox Church was attempting to Hellenize the population, Macedonian and Bulgarian intellectuals banded together to establish a Slavic literary language in opposition to Greek. Two competing centers of literacy rose at the beginning of the nineteenth century: southwestern Macedonia and northeastern Bulgaria. These centers were different enough at every linguistic level to be competing to become the literary language. When the Bulgarian Exarchate was recognized as a millet on par with the Greek millet (on religious grounds), the designation Bulgarian was still a religious term, in opposition to Greek, and the language began to be standardized on the basis of the Bulgarian center of literacy. Intellectuals from the Macedonian center of literacy felt that their dialects were being excluded from the literary Bulgarian language. By the time the Bulgarian state gained independence in 1878, the population of Macedonia and Bulgaria was subjected to conflicting claims from the Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek states and churches, which provided education, and a distinct Macedonian national identity was written about in print. By 1903, a separate Macedonian identity and language is solidified in the works of Krste Petkov Misirkov, who advocates for a distinct Macedonian literary language.  Bulgarian view  Slavonic-Bulgarian History, written in 1762 by Macedonia-born Saint Paisius of Hilendar. In 1946 Elections for a constituent assembly in October gave the Communists a majority. The new authorities officially recognized the Macedonian language, but it lasted only until the Tito-Stalin split in 1948. However, from 1948 to 1963 some Bulgarian linguists still continued to recognize Macedonian as a separate Slavic language.Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie, Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World, Elsevier, 2010, , p. 664. The first big \\"language scandal\\" between Bulgaria and Macedonia happened in November 1966 when the president of the Bulgarian Association of Writers Georgi Dzagarov refused to sign an agreement for friendship and cooperation that was prepared in both Bulgarian and Macedonian language. In 1993 Bulgarian government refused to sign the first bilateral agreement with Republic of Macedonia because the Macedonian language was mentioned in the agreement in the last clause: \\"This agreement is written and signed in Bulgarian and Macedonian language\\". That started a dispute that was resolved in February 1999 when the governments of Bulgaria and Macedonia signed a Joint Declaration where in the last paragraph both governments signed the declaration in: \\"Bulgarian language according to the constitution of Bulgaria and in Macedonian language according to the constitution of Macedonia.\\" The denial to recognize the Macedonian language though persisted in Bulgarian society, so in August 2017 both governments signed another Agreement for Friendship with a clause that mentions the Macedonian language again. In the Bulgarian society there still exists a perception that Bulgaria did not and does not recognize the Macedonian language. Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian. However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem with the Macedonian Language under the formula: \\"the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution\\".1999/02/22 23:50 Bulgaria Recognises Macedonian Language Most Bulgarian linguists consider the Slavic dialects spoken in the region of Macedonia as a part of the Bulgarian dialect area. Numerous shared features of these dialects with Bulgarian are cited as proof. Bulgarian scholars also claim that the overwhelming majority of the Macedonian population had no consciousness of a Macedonian language separate from Bulgarian prior to 1945. Russian scholars cite the early references to the language in Slavic literature from the middle of 10th century to the end of 19th century as \\"bulgarski\\" or \\"bolgarski\\" as proof of that claim. From that, the conclusion is drawn that modern standard Macedonian is not a language separate from Bulgarian either but just another written \\"norm\\" based on a set of Bulgarian dialects. See dialect and dialect continuum to assess the validity of these arguments. Moreover, Bulgarian linguists assert that the Macedonian and Yugoslav linguists who were involved in codifying the new language artificially introduced differences from literary Bulgarian to bring it closer to Serbian.–ò–≤. –ö–æ—á–µ–≤ –∏ –ò–≤. –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤, –î–û–ö–£–ú–ï–ù–¢–ò –ó–ê –°–™–ß–ò–ù–Ø–í–ê–ù–ï–¢–û –ù–ê –ú–ê–ö–ï–î–û–ù–°–ö–ò–Ø –ö–ù–ò–ñ–û–í–ï–ù –ï–ó–ò–ö They are also said to have resorted to falsifications and deliberate misinterpretations of history and documents in order to further the claim that there was a consciousness of a separate Macedonian ethnicity before 1944.–ö–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –¶—ä—Ä–Ω—É—à–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º—ä—Ç –∏ —Å—ä–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è —Å—Ä–µ—â—É –Ω–µ–≥–æ, –£–Ω–∏–≤. –∏–∑–¥. \\"–°–≤. –ö–ª–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç –û—Ö—Ä–∏–¥—Å–∫–∏\\", –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1992 Although the original aim of the codifiers of Macedonian was to distance it from both Bulgarian and Serbian, Bulgarians today view the standard Macedonian language as heavily Serbianised, especially with regards to its vocabulary.Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia, Author Bernard A.

Venko Markovski, writer, poet and Communist politician from the region of Macedonia, who in 1945 participated in the Commission for the Creation of the Macedonian Alphabet and once wrote in the Macedonian language and published what was the first contemporary book written in standardized Macedonian, stated in an interview for Bulgarian National Television only seven days prior to his death, that ethnic Macedonians and the Macedonian language do not exist and that they were a result of Comintern manipulation. Part of Bulgarian scholars and people hold the view that Macedonian is one of three \\"norms\\" of the Bulgarian language, the other two being standard Bulgarian and the language of the Banat Bulgarians. This formulation was detailed in 1978 in a document of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences entitled \\"The Unity of the Bulgarian Language Today and in the Past\\". Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, it has not recognized Macedonian as a unique language since it reversed its recognition of the language and ethnic group in the late 1950s.Shoup, Paul (1968).

(1997) The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World (Princeton : Princeton University Press) Therefore Greeks were objecting to the use of the \\"Macedonian\\" name in reference to the modern Slavic language, calling it \\"Slavomacedonian\\" (), a term coined by some members of the Slavic-speaking community of northern Greece itself and used by Georgi Pulevski in his book \\"A Dictionary of Three languages\\".Although acceptable in the past, current use of this name in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered pejorative and offensive by ethnic Macedonians. In the past, the Macedonian Slavs in Greece seemed relieved to be acknowledged as Slavomacedonians. Pavlos Koufis, a native of Greek Macedonia, pioneer of ethnic Macedonian schools in the region and local historian, says in Laografika Florinas kai Kastorias (Folklore of Florina and Kastoria), Athens 1996: > \\"[During its Panhellenic Meeting in September 1942, the KKE mentioned that > it recognises the equality of the ethnic minorities in Greece] the KKE > recognised that the Slavophone population was ethnic minority of > Slavomacedonians. This was a term, which the inhabitants of the region > accepted with relief. [Because] Slavomacedonians = Slavs+Macedonians. The > first section of the term determined their origin and classified them in the > great family of the Slav peoples.\\" The Greek Helsinki Monitor reports: > \\"... the term Slavomacedonian was introduced and was accepted by the > community itself, which at the time had a much more widespread non-Greek > Macedonian ethnic consciousness. Unfortunately, according to members of the > community, this term was later used by the Greek authorities in a > pejorative, discriminatory way; hence the reluctance if not hostility of > modern-day Macedonians of Greece (i.e. people with a Macedonian national > identity) to accept it.\\" Demetrius Andreas Floudas, Senior Associate of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, explains that it was only in 1944 that Josip Broz Tito, in order to increase his regional influence, gave to the southernmost province of Yugoslavia (officially known as Vardarska banovina under the banate regional nomenclature) the new name of People's Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, in a \\"political master-stroke\\", the local language - which was until then held to be a western Bulgarian dialect - was unilaterally christened \\"Macedonian\\" and became one of Yugoslavia's official languages. LSE Conference Paper; Greece: Prospects for Modernisation, London, 1994. Greece similarly rejects the former name \\"Republic of Macedonia\\", seeing it as an implicit territorial claim on the whole of the region. Books have been published in Greece which purport to expose the alleged artificial character of the Macedonian language.Roudometof, V. (1996) \\"Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question\\" in Journal of Modern Greek Studies Vol. 14, pp. 253‚Äì302. In 3 June 2018, the Greek Minister of Shipping and Island Policy Panagiotis Kouroublis, acknowledged that Greece fully recognizes the term \\"Macedonian language\\" for the modern Slavic language, since the 1977 UN Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, a fact confirmed on 6 June by the Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, who stated that the language was recognized by the New Democracy-led government of that time. Kotzias also revealed classified documents confirming the use of the term \\"Macedonian Language\\" by the past governments of Greece, as well as pointing out to official statements of the Greek Prime Minister Evangelos Averoff who in 1954 and 1959 used the term \\"Macedonian language\\" to refer to the South Slavic language. New Democracy denied these claims, noting that the 1977 UN document states clearly that the terminology used thereof (i.e. the characterization of the languages) does not imply any opinion of the General Secretariat of the UN regarding the legal status of any country, territory, borders etc. Further, New Democracy stated that in 2007 and 2012, as governing party, included Greece's objections in the relevant UN documents.\\"ND dismisses accusations that it recognized \\"macedonian\\" language since 1977\\", Prot Thema newspaper, June 8, 2018 In Greek. On 12 June 2018, the Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, announced that the recognition of the Macedonian language by Greece is reaffirmed in the Prespa agreement.  Serbian view  Serbia officially recognises the Macedonian language as a separate language from Bulgarian. In the 2002 census c.26,000 people declared themselves as Macedonians.SN31  Views of linguists  Linguists outside of North Macedonia and Bulgaria subscribe either to a pro-Macedonian or a pro-Bulgarian view. Illustrating the pro-Macedonian view is Horace Lunt, a Harvard professor, who wrote the first English language grammar of the Macedonian language in the early 1950s: \\"Bulgarian scholars, who argue that the concept of a Macedonian language was unknown before World War II, or who continue to claim that a Macedonian language does not exist look not only dishonest, but silly, while Greek scholars who make similar claims are displaying arrogant ignorance of their Slavic neighbours\\"; (Lunt 1984:110, 120). Similarly, Loring Danforth, a professor of anthropology at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, addresses the stance of linguists, who attribute the origin of the Macedonian language to their will, stressing that all languages in the standardisation process have a certain political and historical context to them and the fact that Macedonian language had a political context in which it was standardised doesn't mean it is not a language. Illustrating the pro-Bulgarian view, Italian linguist Vittore Pisani stated \\"the Macedonian language is actually an artifact produced for primarily political reasons\\".Pisani, V. \\"Il Macedonico, Paideia, Rivista Letteraria di informazione bibliografica\\", vol. 12, p. 250, 1957 German linguist Friedrich Scholz argues that the Macedonian national consciousness and from that conscientious promotion of Macedonian as a written language first appears just in the beginning of the twentieth century and is strengthened particularly during the years between the two world wars.Friedrich Scholz, Slavische Etymologie, Harrassowitz, 1966 Austrian linguist Otto Kronsteiner states that the Macedonian linguists artificially introduced differences from the literary Bulgarian language to bring Macedonian closer to Serbian, jesting that the Macedonian language is a Bulgarian one, but written on a Serbian typewriter.Der Zerfall Jugoslawiens und die Zukunft der makedonischen Literatursprache: Der sp√§te Fall von Glottotomie?

Cook released his debut solo album titled Wolves, October 12, 2018.https://genius.com/albums/Kyle-cook/Wolves The album had been put on hold as he created music with Sheila Marshall under the name Rivers and Rust. The duo parted ways in late 2017. In an Instagram post on April 9, 2016, Cook announced his departure from Matchbox Twenty, citing \\"deterioration of communication, disagreements on when, where and how we tour and a general break down of democracy within the group.\\" However, less than a year later on March 27, 2017, Cook announced Matchbox Twenty's North America co-headlining summer tour with Counting Crows, and that Rivers and Rust would be the opening act. Regarding Cook's status in the band, Matchbox Twenty member Paul Doucette replied, \\"Kyle is back!\\" in response to a fan's question on Twitter. =The New Left= The New Left was an alternative rock band that released one EP in 2004.

Under the name Downpour, the group had played proms and parties, but had parted ways once graduation came around. After Cook became part of Matchbox Twenty, the trio had kept in touch and recorded demos during Cook's time off from touring. Adopting the new name \\"The New Left\\", they added the guitarist and singer-songwriter Eamon Ryland. The group's only release was an EP, Let Go, which was released in 2004 during Cook's hiatus from Matchbox Twenty.

History Karem Atzmona founded on Tu Bishvat in 2001, was located adjacent to the settlement of Bnei Atzmon. The settlement was never legally recognized by the Israeli government. The history of Kerem Atzmona starts prior to the outbreak of the Second Intifada. Between the settlements of Morag and Bnei Atzmon, within Gush Katif, lied several thousand dunams of unused land that until a decade earlier had been a vineyard (kerem in Hebrew translates to vineyard) of Bnei Atzmon. In the summer of 2000, second generation children of the settlement decided to hold a summer camp on the plateau which is sixty meters above sea level. A few months later in the fall, before the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana (and before the October 2000 riots), two families decided to move to the site and live in a trailer. The following spring, more families decided to move to the location and took up residence in additional trailers that were installed on the site. At the beginning of this venture, financial and logistical support came from the community of Bnei Atzmon, but eventually the residents themselves became independent and took administrative control of that neighborhood-turned-settlement. Along with the living quarters, a synagogue, a mikveh for men, and a children's playground were built. Plans for adding a nursery were already finalized, and a master plan for an expansion along with permanent housing was in development at the time of evacuation. Unilateral disengagement The 20 families of Kerem Atzmon were evicted on August 17, 2005 by the Israeli Army and Israeli Police. The trailers and other structures were destroyed.

Opened in the autumn of 1980, it was the first of several Tournament Players Clubs to be built. It is home to the PGA Tour headquarters and hosts The Players Championship, one of the PGA Tour's signature events, now held in March. Paul and Jerome Fletcher negotiated a deal with the PGA Tour, which included the donation of for one dollar (the original check is prominently displayed in the clubhouse). The TPC at Sawgrass is situated in Ponte Vedra Beach's Sawgrass development. It has two individual courses, the Stadium Course and the Valley Course. The Stadium Course was designed by noted golf course architects Pete and Alice Dye, and is known as one of the most difficult golf courses in the world. Constructed specifically to host The Players Championship, it employs a distinctive \\"stadium\\" concept: like in other sports, fans at the TPC sit in \\"stands\\" made of raised mounds of grass. It is known for its signature hole, the par-3, 17th, known as the \\"Island Green,\\" one of golf's most recognizable and difficult holes. It has a capacity of 36,000. The course has been featured for many years on the best- selling Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games. Dye‚Äôs Valley Course hosted the Web.com Tour Championship from 2013 to 2015. History Built on in the northeastern Florida swampland, it is about a mile west of the Atlantic Ocean. The course contains many challenging features: narrow fairways lined with hazards like marshes and \\"waste bunkers\\" (long strips of sand that groundskeepers never maintain); dozens of deep \\"pot bunkers,\\" strategically placed to catch even a slightly misplaced shot; thick rough that features craters and mounds; tall, shot-obstructing palm trees; and rock-hard, lightning-fast The Tournament Players Championship had been played at adjacent Sawgrass Country Club from 1977 through 1981, one more year than originally planned, as heavy rains during construction pushed its debut back a year. When it moved west to the Stadium Course in 1982, the story was not eventual winner Jerry Pate, but the complaints the players had about the new course, which had supposedly been built in their honor. \\"It's Star Wars golf, designed by Darth Vader,\\" Ben Crenshaw pronounced. When asked if the TPC suited his playing style, Jack Nicklaus replied, \\"No, I've never been very good at stopping a 5-iron on the hood of a car.\\" J. C. Snead called the course \\"90 percent horse manure and 10 percent luck.\\" Over the following year, Dye tweaked the course, making the greens less severe and replacing several https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/22/sports/pros-oppose-playing-pga-west- course.html After the changes, the course became far more playable. \\"Now it's a darn good golf course,\\" Crenshaw said of the improvements. The course was the site of the U.S. Amateur in August 1994, where 18-year-old Tiger Woods defeated Trip Kuehne in the finals, the first of his three consecutive victories. The Island Green TPC Sawgrass' signature hole is the Stadium Course's 17th, known simply as the \\"Island Green,\\" although it is technically a peninsula. It measures only from tee to green (requiring only a pitching wedge for most pros), but it consists of nothing but a -long green with a tiny bunker in front of it. Save a small path to the green, the green is completely surrounded by water, and its location amidst many trees causes the wind to swirl over it. Club selection in the weather conditions at the hole is a huge consideration, as there is nowhere to land the ball but on the green, in the small bunker, or in the water. It is estimated that more than 100,000 balls are retrieved from the surrounding water every year, courtesy of professionals and tourists alike. \\"Island Green\\" par-3 17th hole The Island Green design came by accident: the original design for the 17th was to be a simple par-3 green only partially surrounded by a lake. However, the soil surrounding the 17th consisted of sand, which is necessary to build a good golf course, but rare on the otherwise swampy property, and by the time the course was near completion all the sand had been dug from the area, leaving a large crater. Alice Dye suggested the Island Green concept, remembering another course with a similar green. Pete was not thrilled at the idea but went ahead with it, in the process creating one of golf's most recognizable holes. Because of its popularity among fans, Golf Channel devotes eleven cameras to it during the tournament. Probably the most famous incident that has occurred on the Island Green involved Brad Fabel in the 1998 event. His tee shot successfully landed on the green, but then a seagull swooped onto the green and picked up his ball several times. The gull found it difficult to hold the ball in its bill, but finally managed to carry it into the air and over the water, where it dropped it. One of the TV commentators quipped that the 17th now had yet another hazard. Under Rule 18-1 of the Rules of Golf, as a bird is considered an \\"outside agency\\" and as Fabel's shot was at rest, he was permitted to replace the ball at the spot where the ball initially came to rest on the green. In the gusty opening round in May 2007, a record fifty balls found the water at the 17th hole, which broke the single-round tournament record of 45 set During the week of Super Bowl XXXIX, played at nearby Jacksonville in February 2005, Fox Sports organized a \\"closest to pin\\" contest with MLB players, NFL players, and NASCAR drivers competing (all sports properties of the network) on the 17th green. Dale Jarrett defeated Trent Green and John Smoltz in the final by being the only player to make it on the green.

Fitzgerald was born at Purley House in Berkshire, but was brought up at Shalstone Manor, Bucks ‚Äì his mother ‚Äì Sarah Anne Elizabeth Purefoy Jervoise' family home. He was educated at Harrow from 1847 to 1852, playing for the Harrow XI in 1852. He proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge where he played for Cambridge University in 1854 and 1856. As a right-handed batsman and a round-arm right-arm fast bowler, he represented Cambridge University, MCC, Middlesex, in 46 first-class matches between 1854 and 1874. He also played for I Zingari, the Gentleman of MCC, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. Between 1854 and 1874 he played 50 matches per year and in 1866 scored over 1,000 runs. Fitzgerald was popular and witty. Lord Harris wrote of him: \\"Whether it was the magnificence of his swagger, the luxuriance of his beard, the fun that rolled out of him so easily, or the power of his swiping, I do not know, but as regards each he could not escape notice.\\" Harris accompanied Fitzgerald on the first MCC tour abroad to North America in 1872. Fitzgerald's own book, Wickets in the West was published in 1873 and records this tour. Among the tour party was WG Grace who had been proposed by Fitzgerald in 1867 as a member of MCC. As Secretary of the MCC (1863‚Äì1876), Fitzgerald sought greater influence for MCC \\"off the field\\" and did much to help improve Lord's Cricket Ground and its facilities. He became MCC's first paid secretary in 1865. Fitzgerald was brother-in-law to his close friend Hon Sir Edward Chandos Leigh. They were both members of I Zingari on regular tours to Ireland; to Paris in 1867 and around the country estates of England and Wales. Both enjoyed the pleasures of touring and entertaining their hosts in amateur dramatics. This is recorded in Fitzgerald's own cricketing scrapbook and also John Lorraine Baldwin's scrapbooks dating back to the origin of the I Zingari in 1845. In 1876, Fitzgerald was asked to resign his post as MCC secretary due to deteriorating health. It has been speculated that he contracted neurosyphilis, which incidentally was the same illness that killed Lord Randolph Churchill. Fitzgerald died in 1881 at his home in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, at the age of 47. A tangible memorial to him is on display at the MCC museum: his illustrated scrapbooks recording matches played between 1859 ‚Äì 1866. The book contains the earliest cricketing photographs taken. Fitzgerald was also a keen amateur photographer. Fitzgerald also wrote a humorous book titled Jerks in from Short Leg 1published in 1865 and contributed to numerous cricketing publications including Bell's Life between 1859 ‚Äì 1874. He also proof-read Arthur Haygarth's Score & Biographies which MCC supported during his time as secretary. The Hon Sir Edward Chandos Leigh as President of MCC in 1887 paid homage to Fitzgerald. In his autobiography Bar, Bat and Bit, Leigh wrote: \\"It was, I think, a fortunate thing for the Club and for the cricketing world generally when he (Fitzgerald) became secretary, for a new era seems to have dawned at Lord's with his arrival, and all the vast improvements which took place there owed their origin, inception, and development to his fertile brain and his untiring energy\\".

This HMG box is a DNA binding domain that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic species. Homologues have been identified in insects, nematodes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and a range of mammals. However, HMG boxes can be very diverse in nature, with only a few amino acids being conserved between species. Sox genes are defined as containing the HMG box of a gene involved in sex determination called SRY, which resides on the Y-chromosome. There are 20 SOX genes present in humans and mice, and 8 present in Drosophila. Almost all Sox genes show at least 50% amino acid similarity with the HMG box in Sry. The family is divided into subgroups according to homology within the HMG domain and other structural motifs, as well as according to functional assays. The developmentally important Sox family has no singular function, and many members possess the ability to regulate several different aspects of development. While many Sox genes are involved in sex determination, some are also important in processes such as neuronal development. For example, Sox2 and Sox3 are involved in the transition of epithelial granule cells in the cerebellum to their migratory state. Sox 2 is also a transcription factor in the maintenance of pluripotency in both Early Embryos and ES Cells. Granule cells then differentiate to granule neurons, with Sox11 being involved in this process. It is thought that some Sox genes may be useful in the early diagnosis of childhood brain tumours due to this sequential expression in the cerebellum, making them a target for significant research. Sox proteins bind to the sequence WWCAAW and similar sequences (W=A or T). They have weak binding specificity and unusually low affinity for DNA. Sox genes are related to the Tcf/Lef1 group of genes which also contain a sequence-specific high mobility group and have a similar sequence specificity (roughly TWWCAAAG). Groups Sox genes are classified into groups. Sox genes from different groups share little similarity outside the DNA-binding domain.

Modeling was designed at the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), which was incorporated into the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) in 1992. The round is specifically modeled for the 120 mm M256 main gun on the Abrams M1A1 and M1A2 main battle tanks. The penetrator is carried by a sabot during its acceleration in the gun barrel. Variants = M829 = The M829 has a ballistic nose and five tail fins made of aluminum. It is carried in the gun tube by a three-piece aluminum sabot, which separates into three \\"petals\\" soon after the round leaves the gun tube. The propulsion system uses an obturating case base with a semi-combustible cartridge wall. It has a total weight of and utilizes a DU penetrator with a rod diameter, which will reach a muzzle velocity of using of of JA-2 propellant. Maximum effective range is . According to Jane's, the M829 is capable of penetrating of RHA steel armor at up to a range. The original M829 is no longer in production and has been succeeded by the M829A1, M829A2, and M829A3. The corresponding training round is the M865 costing $1,121. = M829A1 = The M829A1 (nicknamed the \\"Silver Bullet\\" by Operation Desert Storm tank crews) proved itself in 1991 against Iraqi T-55 and T-72 tanks during Operation Desert Storm.

The effective target range is . = M829A2 = M829A2 cross-section The next generation ammunition, called 120 mm APFSDS-T M829A2, entered service in 1994, and is the current armor penetrator ammunition being produced by the General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems for the 120 mm M256 gun of tanks M1A1 and M1A2. It is a technology improvement over the M829A1. The new ammunition's performance gains, while classified, result from several new features. These include the use of a special manufacturing process to improve the structural quality of the depleted uranium penetrator. This, plus the use of new composites for the sabot, which, together with a new propellant, provide superior penetrator performance. Combined, these features increase the muzzle velocity of the M829A2 approximately 100 m/s greater than the M829A1 (up to approximately 1,675 m/s), while operating at slightly lower pressure. Projectile length: 780 mm; weight: 9 kg. On 6 May 2014, the U.S. Army announced that it awarded a US$12 million contract to defense contractor General Dynamics for the demilitarization and disposal of 78,000 aging depleted-uranium (DU) tank rounds as newer rounds are added to the U.S. war reserves. The contract includes M829A1 and M829A2 rounds. = M829A3 = The M829A2 was the immediate response, developed in part to take on this new ERA type. The M829A3 is a further improvement, designed to defeat any future armor protection methods like 'Kaktus' ERA, which was seen on the now cancelled prototype tank, the T-80UM2 \\"Chiorny Oriol\\" (Black Eagle) tank. It completed type classification standard in March 2003. Very little is publicly known about the round, perhaps due to export restrictions (see International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)). The M829A3 uses a more efficient propellant, RPD-380, boosting its muzzle velocity. The M829A3 round has a total mass of and length of . It uses of RPD-380 stick propellant, accelerating a depleted- uranium rod penetrator, which can be estimated from cutaway mock-ups to be long, to a muzzle velocity of . From patents submitted by Orbital ATK, the penetrator is composed of two sections, an approximately steel tip and the rest composed of depleted uranium. The penetrator diameter was also increased from to , improving penetrator strength by 67%. This suggests the steel tip is used to defeat the ERA, with the depleted uranium using to complete the penetration through the vehicle's passive armour. Resulting muzzle energy is . The sabot is of composite material. This variant is unofficially referred to by Abrams tank crews as the \\"super sabot\\". It costs around $8,500. Although the M829A3 fired from the 44-caliber M256 gun has a lower muzzle velocity than 120 mm shells fired from the Rheinmetall 55-caliber gun barrel or Russian 2A46 125 mm gun ammunition, it uses a larger penetrator with increased mass to increase imparted kinetic energy.China Builds the World's Fastest Tank Gun, Then Tries to Hide It - Popsci.com, 19 June 2015 = M829A4 = The A4 (formerly E4) variant was under development by General Dynamics Ordnance & Tactical Systems and Alliant Techsystems (ATK) until ATK received a $77 million, three-year contract on 11 July 2011 to develop and qualify the M829A4 Advanced Kinetic Energy (AKE) round for the U.S. Army's M1A2 SEP (System Enhancement Package) Abrams MBT.ATK To Develop M829A4 120mm Advanced Kinetic Energy Round for M1A2 SEP Tank - Deagel.com, 11 July 2011 The M829A4 is a fifth-generation APFSDS-T cartridge consisting of depleted-uranium penetrator with a three-petal composite sabot; the penetrator includes a low-drag fin with a tracer, and a windshield and tip assembly.Fifth generation Army tank cartridge reports loudly for duty - Army.mil, 18 April 2014 Its propellant maintains consistent muzzle velocities across operational temperatures from .

She went into the Games as world number one, hoping to emulate the gold medal victory of Steph Cook in the previous Olympics. She said that the shooting event was her worst out of the five events. Two weeks prior to the Games she suffered a stress fracture in her right leg, requiring an orthopaedic cast. In the first round of Olympic competition, the shooting, she scored 156 points out of 200 which left her sitting in 30th place out of 32 competitors. The fencing round saw her move up to 26th after winning 16 of the 31 one on one matches against the other pentathletes. She finished second in the swimming with a time of 2:14:60, moving her further up to 19th overall. After finishing the showjumping as the fourth event, she moved up to fourteenth overall. She mounted a comeback in the final event, the cross- country, and completed the race over thirty seconds faster than anyone else, moving her up to third place and winning the bronze medal. She had started 51 seconds behind the third placed athlete, Claudia Corsini, and needed to overtake twelve athletes during the race. During the build up to the 2008 Summer Olympics, Harland won the third World Cup event of 2007, which was Harland's first event of the year. However, she suffered an injury prior to the Games and failed to qualify. She retired at the close of the 2008 season.

The cheese was traditionally made for domestic use by crofters and smallholders in the Scottish Highlands and Islands, using milk from the family cow. Its origins date as far back as the Viking era and possibly even earlier to the time of the Picts. Crowdie is a variety of lactic cheese. These rely primarily on the action of the bacteria converting the milk lactose to lactic acid to create curds. When the milk acidity becomes high enough, the milk will coagulate even without the use of rennet. Crowdie used to be made by letting raw skimmed milk warm on a windowsill or by the fire until it was thickened naturally by the lactic acid which formed as the milk soured. The thickened milk was then heated gently until curds were formed. The warm curds were hung up to drip in a muslin cloth to drain the whey, then mixed with salt and sometimes a little cream to make a soft, crumbly cheese with a high moisture content and short shelf life. The natural souring of the unpasteurised milk gave the cheese its fresh, slightly citric taste. Following WWII crowdie production on a domestic scale declined with the passing of crafting traditions. Its survival is credited to Susannah Stone, who continued to make it near the Ross-shire village of Tain. Apparently one day in 1962, after making too much, she offered the surplus to a local grocer. Her traditional crowdie became popular enough that she and her husband began to produce it commercially with their other traditional Scottish cheeses. Crowdie is now usually made from pasteurised milk in which most of the bacteria have been killed, so lactic acid is added to the milk to begin the souring process. The cheese is often eaten with oatcakes and recommended before a ceilidh, as it is said to alleviate the effects of drinking whisky. There are several variations on the basic Crowdie: one variety known as \\"Black Crowdie\\" or \\"Gruth Dubh\\" is made by mixing crowdie with double cream and rolling it in a mixture of pinhead oatmeal and crushed black peppercorns. Hramsais is a crowdie mixed with wild garlic and white and red pepper. Galic Hramsa is rolled in crumbled flaked hazelnuts and almonds. One of the most popular ways of eating the cheese is to turn it into a dessert called Cream Crowdie or Cranachan, traditionally eaten as part of a Burns supper The recipe usually includes double cream, oats, whisky, honey and raspberries.

The political theme of the film is the battle between nature on the one hand and commercialisation and industrialisation on the other set to exploit and ultimately destroy land and natural resources. The film can also be seen as an early criticism of globalisation as it depicts foreign, and large scale, capitalist investors and entrepreneurs as exploiters working side by side with domestic, small scale, capitalists. The songs in The Apple War are composed and written by Evert Taube, who also makes a cameo in the film as the old man who dances with Monica Zetterlund at the end party, and while there also recites a part of one of his most famous songs, \\"Calle Schewens vals\\", performed by the cast in the same scene at the end. Winner of three Guldbagge Awards, The Apple War is a popular cult film in Sweden, and referred to as a \\"Hasse & Tage\\" film due to the creators Tage Danielsson and Hasse Alfredson.

Professor Manne published many books and articles, with emphasis on law and economics, the free market, and securities regulation. His development of the theory of a \\"market for corporate control\\" is credited with opening the entire field of corporate law to economic analysis, and his 1966 book, Insider Trading and the Stock Market, began, and still heavily influences, the vast literature on that subject. He was a frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal. The Liberty Fund, of Indianapolis, Indiana, recently published The Collected Works of Henry G. Manne in three volumes. Among his notable educational innovations are the Law and Economics Center (LEC), the first academic center devoted to the development of the field of Law and Economics (presently part of the George Mason University School of Law); the Economics Institutes for Law Professors; the Law Institutes for Economists; the Economics Institutes for Federal Judges; the first specialized law degree program for PhDs in economics; and the first law school (George Mason) whose curriculum was built around the use of economics in law.

Born Benjamin Levy, he was the son of a Jewish merchant Louis Levy. Beginnings at His Majesty's Theatre Lumley's father was a clothes-dealer who had made his original fortune in Canada. The young Benjamin Levy was a pupil at King Edward's School, Birmingham.Conway (2012), 116 Lumley trained as a solicitor, and then studied for the Bar under Basil Montagu. In this capacity he gave legal advice to the financially troubled manager of what was then His Majesty's Theatre, Pierre Laporte, who came to rely on him extensively. As Lumley had become familiar with making managerial decisions for the theatre, when Laporte died in 1841 the board of the opera company, consisting mainly of wealthy noblemen, asked him to take over.Conway (2012), 117 Lumley had already written a standard handbook on Parliamentary private bills and was launched on a promising legal career. But his memoirs clearly indicate his pleasure in mixing in high society and making a name for himself. Management of the now renamed (after the accession of Queen Victoria) Her Majesty's Theatre gave him an opportunity of close relationship with stars of the opera and ballet, to giveSee for example Lumley's description of \\"the monster f√™te given by me in the grounds of my charming villa at Fulham\\" (Lumley (1864), 322‚Äì3). and to be invited to ostentatious parties, and to bring high-quality Italian opera to Victorian London. The conductor at Her Majesty's was Michael Costa. By their different natures ‚Äì one a devotee of high musical standards, the other a connoisseur of the star system, Lumley and Costa should have made a perfect team. And indeed they were so for the first five years, one of the longer surviving partnerships of the age. Artistic progress ‚Äì induced by Lumley, against the inclinations of the more conservatively inclined Costa ‚Äì included the introduction of operas by Giuseppe Verdi to London, and new singing and dancing stars to replace the fading 'old guard', negotiations with Felix Mendelssohn for an opera on William Shakespeare's play The Tempest ‚Äì and, in 1847, the London debut of Jenny Lind. The resulting financial success led the optimistic Lumley to purchase the underlying lease of the theatre. One of the sensations of Lumley's management was the balletic 'Pas de Quatre', choreographed by Perrot, and with music by Pugni, in 1845. This divertissement, which featured as dancers Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Cerrito and Grahn, may have been inspired by Lumley seeing four girls dancing outside the theatre. The 'Pas de Quatre' became an institution and is frequently revived. Conflict with Costa First, Costa felt neglected by Lumley, who, wisely from an artistic point of view, was not keen to produce Costa's own ballets and operas. Furthermore, Lumley refused to permit Costa to take up the appointment of chief conductor to the Royal Philharmonic Society, then the leading London symphonic orchestra. In 1846 Costa decamped to Covent Garden, with most of the orchestra and singers, and the support of some leading London critics, to establish there the second Royal Italian Opera Company in competition with Lumley. Lumley swiftly fought back, showing all his skills as an opportunist. He engaged the composer Michael Balfe to replace Costa. In 1847, despite legal threats from the Covent Garden management, he brought Jenny Lind over for her London debut, for which he had prepared with unprecedented levels of spin and publicity. Giuseppe Verdi had been engaged to write an opera for London. Originally, it was intended to be Macbeth, but this was first given in Florence, so Verdi decided to produce I masnadieri for London. Verdi left Italy at the end of May 1847 with his work for London completed, except for the orchestration, which he left until the opera was in rehearsal. The cast assembled for the premiere on 22 July 1847 was of the highest international standard. In particular, as the highlight of her first season in England, the great Swedish coloratura soprano Jenny Lind was engaged to create the role of Amalia, the opera's heroine. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attended the first performance, together with the Duke of Wellington and every member of the British aristocracy and fashionable society that was able to gain admission. After considerable persuasion Verdi agreed to conduct the premiere, which was a triumphant success, and the press was for the most part generous in its praise. Fortunately for Lumley, things had turned out well ‚Äì and very profitably. Lind appeared as Alice in Robert le diable by Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Mendelssohn, on his last London visit, who had encouraged her to take up Lumley's offer, was in the audience despite his known distaste for Meyerbeer's work. Lumley had also extensively advertised Mendelssohn's Tempest opera as forthcoming. This was a bare-faced lie. Mendelssohn found the libretto by Eugene Scribe completely unacceptable and did not even begin to write the music for it. The death of Mendelssohn in 1847 however gave Lumley an escape from his fabrications, and he commissioned the French composer Fromental Hal√©vy to take it on. But the premiere of La Tempesta in 1850 was, at most, a succ√®s d'√©stime. Financial problems Meanwhile Lumley had extended his interests by taking on in addition the management of the Th√©√¢tre des Italiens in Paris, and was soon negotiating with the actress Rachel and Victor Hugo. His frenzied activities resemble closely the hubris of speculative tycoons over-reaching themselves. He soon began to have problems paying his stars and was surprised when they began to walk out on him. The soprano Johanna Wagner, niece of the composer Wagner, was lured to Covent Garden, sparking off a complex litigation. The resulting case, 'Lumley v. Gye', is still regarded as a fundamental basis of employment contract law. Lumley won the case, but it was for him a pyrrhic victory, resulting in financial loss. By 1853 the financial problems were overwhelming, and Lumley ran for cover to France. He was tempted back when in 1856, the Covent Garden Theatre once again caught fire, and for three years he became again a leader of Italian opera in London. But when Covent Garden was rebuilt, (the same theatre that stands today), he was offered the tenure for ¬£100,000, funds which he simply didn't have. Abandonment of the opera Lumley returned to the law, and in his later years wrote two works of fantasy and a legal reference book. His previous successes were never to be repeated. He died in 1875, leaving less than ¬£1000 in his will.Conway (2012), 119. References Notes Sources Lumley, Benjamin (1864), Reminiscences of the Opera, London. * Matthew, Colin; Brian Harrison (Eds.)

The Ewe are known for their experience in drumming throughout West Africa. The sophisticated cross rhythms and polyrhythms in Ewe drumming are similar to those in Afro-Caribbean music and late jazz. The original purpose of Ewe drumming were sung or performed by warriors. Now the songs and performed to celebrate or for recreational use. For example, Agbadza was originally used as a warrior dance but is now used to celebrate events. Variation Ewe drumming is very diverse and is played in many slightly different ways. For example, an Ewe musician from Togo may play a piece or instrument slightly differently from the way a Ewe from Ghana does. The Fon people of Benin are another example of this variation. They construct their villages, towns, and cities on water, and because of this, they do not play the same upright drums other Ewe play. Instead, they place large gourds on water as drums. Instrumental performance An Ewe drumming ensemble consists of several drums, a bell, and a rattle. Each ensemble usually has a master drum, an iron bell called a gankogui, and a group of secondary drummers. Bell instruments =Gankogui= Gankogui The gankogui, also known as a gakpevi, is a bell, or gong instrument played with a wooden stick. It is made out of forged iron and consists of a low-pitched bell (often referred as the parent bell) and a high-pitched bell (or the child bell, which is said to rest on the bosom of the protective parent), which are permanently bound together. The gankogui is the skeleton, backbone, and foundation of all traditional Ewe music. The gankogui player must play steadily and without error throughout the piece. The gankogui player must be a trustworthy person, and is considered blind if they do not have a concrete understanding of the instrument and its role in the drumming ensemble. In a drumming ensemble, a gankogui player uses no variation. =Atoke= The atoke is a forged-iron bell instrument and is shaped somewhat like a boat or a banana. It is held in the palm of the player's weak hand and is played with a small forged-iron rod, held in the player's strong hand. You strike the rod against the outside of the bell to create a pitch. The atoke serves the same purpose as the gankogui and is sometimes used instead of or a substitute for the gankogui. The gankogui and atoke come in all various sizes. Rattle instrument Axatse The next instrument used in traditional Ewe drumming is called axatse (pronounced ah- hah-chay). The axatse is a rattle-like instrument made from a hollowed-out gourd covered with a net of seeds or beads. The axatse is usually played sitting down. It is held at the handle and in the players strong hand and is shaken up hitting the hand and down hitting the thigh making two different sounds. The axatse usually plays the same thing that the bell plays but with some extra added notes in between the beats. It can be described as the eighth note version of what the gankogui plays. It has also been described as enriching or reinforcing what the gankogui plays. Overall it gives energy to the music and drives the music. The axatse produces a dry rattling but energetic sound. Standard bell pattern and accompanying axatse part Standard bell pattern (top) with accompanying axatse part (bottom). The axatse begins on the second stroke (in parenthesis) The most common gankogui part is the 12-pulse basic Ewe,Ladzekpo, Kwaku (1977). Cited by Pe√±alosa (2010: 243).

Urbana, IL: University of Illinois. The axatse part that accompanies the standard pattern is: \\"pa ti pa pa ti pa ti pa ti pa pa.\\" The \\"pa's\\" sound the standard pattern by striking the gourd against the knee. The \\"ti's\\" sound pulses in between the bell strokes, by raising the gourd in an upward motion and striking it with the free hand. As is common with many African rhythms, the axatse part begins (first \\"pa\\") on the second stroke of the bell (1a), and the last \\"pa\\" coincides with 1. By ending on the beginning of the cycle, the axatse part contributes to the cyclic nature of the overall rhythm. See: standard bell with accompanying axatse part. Atsiagbekor. Master drums In almost all West African drumming ensembles, a lead drum or master drum leads the group. The master drummer tells the ensemble when to play and when to stop, he also plays signals telling the other players to change the tempo or the drumming pattern. In some West African drumming ensembles, the master drummer is to play the main theme of the piece and improvise. In Ewe drumming, the master drummer does drum dialogue with the kidi. It enriches the kidi phrase by filling in the empty spaces on the kidi‚Äôs part. The master drum can also improvise. In Ewe drumming, the term master drum is not limited to one particular type of drum. A master drum can be an atsimevu, sogo, kroboto, totodzi, or an agboba; these are the only types of drums used as master drums, however. Different master drums are used in different pieces. For example, if a group is playing \\"Agbadza\\" (an old Ewe war dance), the master drummer plays the sogo. The master drum techniques and playing styles are generally the same regardless of which drum is used. =Sogo= The basic master drum is called a sogo (pronounced \\"so-go)\\". Sogo is the drum that can always be a substitute for the master drum. It is also the actual \\"correct\\" master drum for some pieces. The sogo is a larger version of the kidi and is taller and fatter than the kidi. It can be played either with two wooden sticks, one hand and one stick, or both hands. This depends on the technique used in the piece being played. Depending on the piece, sometimes the sogo can play the same support role as the kidi. It produces a low tone and is usually played sitting down.or standing up. =Atsimevu= Another master drum is called atsimevu (pronounced ah-chee-meh-voo). The atsimevu is the tallest of the Ewe drums. It is around 4¬Ω feet tall. To play the atsimevu, the drummer must lean it over a stand called a vudetsi, stand on one side of the drum‚Äîand play it with either two wooden sticks or one hand and one stick. The atsimevu makes a middle range sound with some bass in the sound. > In the understanding of a drummer, a drumming stick is an extension of the > hand.

(1995: web). \\"Atsimevu > Tonalities And Performance Techniques,\\" Foundation Course In African Dance- > Drumming. https://home.comcast.net/~dzinyaladzekpo/Foundation.html =Agboba= A newer, lesser used master drum is called the agboba (pronounced ag-bo-bah or sometimes bo-bah). This drum was invented by the Ewe in the 1950s to play a newly invented piece called agahu. The agboba is the deepest sounding drum played by the Ewe. It has a fat body and is played leaning over on a stand similar to that for the atsimevu. =The Kloboto and Totodzi= The kloboto (pronounced klo-bo-toe) or totodzi (pronounced toe-toe-jee) are two more types of master drums, essentially the same, differing only in pitch. These are the smallest drums used by the Ewe. They measure lengthwise around eighteen inches. The two drums are not only used as master drums in some pieces but sometimes play the same role as the kidi. The kloboto and totodzi are always played with two wooden sticks, and their player is usually seated. Other drums =Kidi= The kidi is a mid-sized drum played with two wooden sticks. Like other Ewe drums, the drumhead is made of the skin of a deer or antelope. Its body is made out of wood and is sometimes decorated by elaborate carvings. It normally plays an eighth note pattern with some variation (e.g. a roll played instead of the first note of the phrase). The kidi does what is described by the Ewe as talking or conversing with lead drum. This is often called drum dialogue. The kidi often improvises a little bit at the appropriate times. =Kaganu= The kaganu is the smallest and highest pitched drum used by the Ewe, but its sound does incorporate some bass as well. It is around 20 inches tall. Like all Ewe drums, the kaganu has a drumhead made of antelope or deer skin. The body of the drum is made of wood and is often decorated with carvings. The kaganu is played with two long skinny wooden sticks, usually with the drummer sitting down. Like the gankokui and axatse, its pattern does not change for the duration of the piece. In Agahu, for example, the rhythm it plays are two notes on the upbeats. Because Agahu is played was in the 4/4 time, then the kaganu would play two notes on the \\"ands\\" of beats 1, 2, 3, and 4. The kaganu also gives energy and drive to the music. Tonal drumming Like many West African drums, the master drum and sometimes the kidi have the ability to speak the language. Most African languages are tonal, so by producing different sounds at different pitches on the drum, the drummer can imitate the tones of the language. Some African drums can even imitate consonants by hitting the drum with a stick or hand at different angles and with different parts of the stick or hand. The Ewe also play a pair of two drums called atumpan (pronounced ah-toom-pahn), which are used all over Ghana as talking drums. The atumpan player stands up and plays the drum with two sticks shaped like an L. > In Anlo-Ewe cultural understanding, a drum is a super projection of the > human voice.

In fact, the overall rhythmic structure is generated through cross-rhythm. Cross-rhythm was first identified as the basis of sub-Saharan rhythm in the early writings of A.M. Jones, and was later explained in great detail in lectures by the Ewe master drummer and scholar C.K. Ladzekpo, and in the writings of Locke. > At the center of a core of rhythmic traditions within which the composer > conveys his ideas is the technique of cross rhythm.

(1995: webpage). \\"The Myth of Cross-Rhythm\\" , Foundation > Course in African Dance-Drumming. =3:2 (hemiola)= The most fundamental cross-rhythm in Ewe music, and Sub- Saharan African music traditions in general, is three-against-two (3:2), or six-against-four (6:4), also known as a vertical hemiola. The cycle of two or four beats are the main beat scheme, while the triple beat scheme is secondary. Ladzekpo states: \\"The term secondary beat scheme refers to a component beat scheme of a cross rhythm other than the main beat scheme. In a similar manner as a main beat, each secondary beat is distinguished by measuring off a distinct number of pulsations. A recurrent grouping of a number of these beats in a musical period forms a distinct secondary beat scheme.\\"Ladzekpo, C.K. (1995: webpage). https://home.comcast.net/~dzinyaladzekpo/SixFour.html > We have to grasp the fact that if from childhood you are brought up to > regard beating 3 against 2 as being just as normal as beating in synchrony, > then you develop a two dimensional attitude to rhythm‚Ä¶ This bi-podal > conception is‚Ä¶ part of the African's nature‚ÄîJones (1959: 102)Jones, A.M. > 1959.

The beam of the pit's pumping engine broke and fell down the shaft, trapping the men below. The disaster prompted a change in UK law that henceforth required all collieries to have at least two independent means of escape. Colliery =Hartley old pit= Hartley old pit was established in the coastal village of Hartley (now part of Seaton Sluice), Northumberland during the 13th century; the earliest extant records date from 1291. The colliery suffered increasingly from flooding as the seams were worked out under the sea and in 1760 the first atmospheric engine was installed, followed by later, more powerful, engines. Despite these efforts, the flooding became so severe that the old pit was abandoned in 1844. =Hester pit= Diagram of the Hester Pit, Hartley, Northumberland in 1862 at the time of the disaster; explanations of the labels are in the text. The coal was sufficiently valuable that the following year a new shaft (A on the diagram alongside) was sunk about a mile inland. The low main seam (F) was reached on 29 May 1846. The colliery was called the New Hartley Colliery and the shaft the Hester Pit. Around the pit a new village grew up that was called New Hartley. Women and young children were not employed in the pit and according to E. Raper (Social and Working Conditions in the village of New Hartley 1845‚Äì1900) this gave a higher standard of life for the miners: \\"the miner in New Hartley would return home after a hard day's work to a warm, clean, comfortable home and usually a substantial hot meal\\". In common with many collieries of the period and locality only a single diameter shaft was dug, at a total cost of about ¬£3,600. Coal, men, and materials travelled up and down the shaft, which also accommodated the pumps. In addition, the shaft provided vitally important fresh air ventilation and extraction of the firedamp. In collieries with two or more pits (for instance see the description of Felling), one pit was the \\"downcast pit\\" down which fresh air travelled, the other the \\"upcast pit\\" up which spent air escaped. Within the colliery the air was forced to traverse the whole of the workings by the use of walls of coal left in place, stoppings and traps. At this date the normal means of creating the updraft needed was by using a furnace in the upcast pit. With a single shaft colliery this simple arrangement could not be followed, and so a timber brattice (B) was built from the top of the shaft to the bottom. Men and materials passed up and down on the downcast side, the pumps worked in the upcast. At Hartley a furnace was kept burning in the yard seam (E) with the rising hot gasses passing up the furnace drift (I) to join and draw foul air up the upcast side of the shaft. The vulnerability of such an arrangement had already been identified and publicised before the colliery was sunk. An explosion at the St Hilda pit in South Shields in 1839 had led (as the result of a public meeting) to the formation of a committee to consider the prevention of accidents in mines. The Shields Committee issued their report in 1843; they had found that mines in the North-East were unnecessarily at risk of explosions because they were generally inadequately ventilated with far too few shafts for the size of the underground workings (a view supported by evidence from George Stephenson, amongst others). The committee's report had specifically argued against the practice (which it thought Parliament should legislate against for all new winnings) of sinking a single shaft and sub-dividing it by bratticing to separate in- and out-flowing ventilation air (since any explosion destroying the bratticing would destroy the ventilation of the mine and ensure the death by asphyxiation of those underground). It was later estimated that sinking two shafts instead would have cost an extra ¬£900. In 1852, the pit was flooded to a depth of eight fathoms (i.e., about ) by water from the old pit. A powerful steam engine, ‚Äòthe largest in the county employed in mining purpose‚Äô, was therefore installed in 1855 to operate pumps to recover the pit. Pumping began in September 1855 (in June 1856 the pumping engine was shown off to a visiting French prince) but two years later the pit was not yet in full production and advertised for sale as 'just reopened'. The pumps were in three stages. The lowest stage lifted water from a sump connected to an adit below the low main seam up to the yard seam. There a second stage lifted the water up to a sump in the high main. The pumps were driven by a nominal 300 horsepower beam engine working the pumps directly: the first two stages were driven by the main beam, and the third stage by a subsidiary beam above the pump staple (C). The pit was known as a wet pit and the engine (capable of nine to ten strokes a minute) normally ran at about seven strokes a minute to cope with the water ingress; on loss of pumping the low main would flood within little more than a day from seawater percolating through the roof of the seam from the North Sea above it. Three miners from Hartley were amongst the death toll of an explosion at Burradon in 1860 because (explained the Durham Chronicle) \\"little work has been doing at Hartley colliery lately owing to an accumulation of water\\". At the time of the disaster the high main had been worked out and was closed off; the yard seam was being worked, but only by a few men (and a pit pony); the workings in the low main seam at Hester Pit were being extended to meet those at the Mill Pit at Seaton Sluice; within the year it would have been possible to escape from Hester Pit via the Mill Pit. In the meantime a staple was provided within which was a ladder; this allowed escape to the yard seam from the low main should there be a major inrush of water (\\"the only thing that was feared\\"). The attached drawing is a simplified and corrected version of one that appeared in the Illustrated London News of 1862. C is the pump staple in which pump rods worked by a subsidiary beam operated. D is the worked out and abandoned high main seam. G is the location of the blockage above the yard seam and covering the end of the furnace drift. The vertical passage near H is the staple containing a wire ladder connecting the yard and low main seams.  Disaster  On 16 January 1862 the fore shift went on duty at 02:30. At 10:30 the same morning the back shift were taking over from the fore shift, so most men of both shifts were at the coal face. As the first eight men were ascending, the beam of the pumping engine snapped and fell down the shaft. Although much of the brattice was destroyed, the first part seems to have deflected the beam away from the cage. Other debris did fall on the cage snapping two of the four support chains. Four of the eight men fell; the others managed to cling on. The beam came to rest jammed in the shaft and other falling debris created a blockage deep between the yard seam and the high main. =Rescue attempts= One of the deputies, Matthew Chapman, had been on his way home when he heard the crash. Retracing his steps he had himself lowered on a rope and started to clear away some of the debris with an axe. Realising that the man was exhausted, having just come off shift, the under-viewer Joseph Humble sent him home to rest whilst the main rescue effort was organised. The initial rescue attempt was carried out under the direction of Humble, Carr (owner and viewer), G B Hunter (Cowpen & North Seaton), Hugh Taylor (Backworth) and Matthias Dunn (HM Inspector of Mines). By midnight rescuers had reached the damaged cage and George Sharp Snr was brought up in a rope sling. However, he jammed against some overhanging timbers, came out of the sling and fell to his death. The rescuers (including the by then rested Chapman) then descended the pump staple and lowered a rope sling from the high main. William Shape and Ralph Robinson were brought up from the cage in this manner. Thomas Watson, a Primitive Methodist local preacher, had earlier descended from the cage to the men who had fallen. He remained with them to pray and comfort them until they died. Watson likewise ascended in a sling and was therefore the last man out alive. With the pumps stopped, all knew that the low main would quickly flood. Those on the surface therefore assumed correctly that the men below would make their way via the staple up to the yard seam. Throughout the night men continued to work from ropes. By 9 a.m. Friday the rescuers had removed the rubbish in the shaft (mostly timber from the brattice) to within about from the furnace drift, and thought they could hear noises from the men in the yard seam. They were then relieved by sinkers from nearby pits. William Coulson, the master sinker who had supervised the sinking of the shaft in 1845‚Äì46, was on a train passing through Hartley station on his way to another job. When passing through Newcastle that morning he had learned of the accident; he sent a subordinate to see if assistance was needed. On offering his services, he was put in charge late on Friday afternoon, the previous committee yielding to his greater experience. There were occasional falls of rock from the sides of the shaft below the high main workings. By Saturday night, the rescuers were about four fathoms above the furnace drift. At this depth the shaft crossed a 'trouble'; when rubbish was removed below this there were massive rock falls, with the shaft expanding to up to across in some directions. It became necessary to timber up the sides to secure them before attempting to go lower in the shaft; this took about twelve hours. From Sunday morning onwards, a small hole was excavated through the fallen stone towards the furnace drift. As the men worked through the blockage they were inconvenienced by fumes of carbon monoxide from the upcast furnace and from measures it had ignited. When a small penetration was finally made (3 a.m. Tuesday) there was a release of noxious gas ('carbonic oxide' i.e. carbon monoxide) rendering some of the rescuers speechless; the entire working party had to be rescued and within half an hour the gas had risen to four fathoms above the high main. To restart some ventilation a cloth brattice was rigged from the yard seam down to the work area. This was made from lengths of bratticing cloth held by various local collieries and was not complete until Thursday. On Wednesday morning, with the bratticing incomplete, George Emmerson (one of Coulson's sinkers sent to investigate if what remained of the pumps would collapse further if debris around them was removed) got three yards into the furnace drift before being forced back by the gas. He had seen an axe, saw and sawn timber, indicating that trapped miners had attempted to escape along that route; but the tools were rusty. Carr felt able to reply to a telegram sent from Osborne House (\\"The Queen is most anxious to hear that there are hopes of saving the poor people in the colliery, for whom her heart bleeds\\") that there were still faint hopes of getting at least some of the men out alive, but these hopes were soon dashed. At the pit-head standers-by had expressed unease at the slow progress of the rescue operations. Two pitmen in their number (William Adams of Cowpen and Robert Wilson of Backworth) were invited to go down the pit and report back to their colleagues on how things stood; exceeding their instructions, they managed to enter the yard seam and found dead men. Humble and a fellow-viewer (a Mr Hall from Trimdon) penetrated further and found all the miners dead, but on their return to the bank were severely affected by the gas. Others went down later but many became seriously affected by the gas: they reported (according to the 'Newcastle Journal') dead men in every direction, most near the shaft; most seemed to have died placidly: \\"The exploring parties have seen little boys in the arms of their fathers, and brothers sleeping dead in the arms of brothers\\". The dead pony was untouched; its corn bins had been emptied and some of the dead had corn in their pockets. Although the rescuers had thought they had heard signalling from the trapped men as late as Saturday night, the last entry in the notebook of the back overman described a prayer meeting held at 1.45 on Friday afternoon. =Recovery= Hartley Colliery Disaster: the dead are brought up to their families (L'llustration, 1862, p 101) The task was now recovery of bodies, and, the check-viewer told the waiters at the pit-head, it was no good throwing away the lives of living men to obtain the bodies of dead men: further entries into the yard seam were suspended until the canvas bratticing was completed, and the shaft properly timbered and cleared further to allow the yard seam to be accessed directly, rather than via the furnace drift. The following day, the Journal reported ugly scenes at the pithead, with demands that the bodies be retrieved immediately; conversely the workers in the shaft were becoming more reluctant to run the risk of the continuing rockfalls. On Friday, the rubbish in the shaft fell away to below the entrance to the yard seam, but rockfalls and releases of gas continued. By Saturday the works were complete and the sinkers and shaftmen withdrawn. The victims having been dead a week, the bodies considerably swollen and disfigured and the smell from them offensive, it had been intended to put them into coffins while they were still down the mine, and the medical profession thought it unwise to allow the coffins to lie in the victims' homes until burial. In the event the corpses were raised to the pit head to be identified as far as possible by the tally- boy, sprinkled with chloride of lime, shrouded, and coffined. Compassion overruling prudence, as each body was coffined it was either sent home or, if unidentified, chalked \\"unknown\\" and sent to the Primitive Methodist chapel for later identification. The Journal reporter described the consequent appearance of the village: > All the blinds were drawn; but, looking in at the open doors, we saw coffins > in every house. In most instances, they lay upon the large bed, so > characteristic of the pitman's dwelling ‚Ä¶ Sometimes the bed would not > contain all the coffins; and then they were disposed on chairs beside it. > And so we passed up the row, and saw two, and three, and four coffins all in > one little room, till, at last, coming to the end house, we were appalled to > see a perfect pile of them‚Ä¶;and looking round, we were informed that seven > dead bodies lay in the cottage. In every house women were sitting by the > fire nursing their grief; and strong men, pale and dejected, were visibly > suffering from the reaction of the excitement of the past week. The retrieval of bodies continued until four in the morning of Sunday; the yard seam was then checked thoroughly to ensure all bodies had been removed, and New Hartley and surrounding settlements canvassed to confirm that no body was missing. At one o'clock on the Sunday carts arrived at the cottages and most of the coffins were carried in procession to Earsdon Church. The graveyard was not large enough and more land was given by the Duke of Northumberland; the large number of graves suddenly needed were dug by men from Seaton Delaval colliery. Fifty men were employed in digging the graves, and they did not complete their task until well after interments started (at about one thirty); dusk was falling as the last coffin was buried. A list was published of 'the workmen left alive that were employed at Hartley Colliery': there were only fifty-five. The loss of life was extreme, even by Victorian era coal mining standards, and remains one of the worst mining accidents in England.See mining disaster =Causes= An engraving of a close view of the fractured beam An inquest was held on Tuesday 21 January 1862 on the five men killed directly by the beam fall, but this heard little evidence, the coroner expecting a \\"more particular inquiry, should some of the rest not be got out alive\\". The enginemen reported what they had seen and heard when the beam failed; one also told of an incident during maintenance about a month previously. The beam had been lifted by hydraulic jacks from its centre bearing to allow the bearing brasses to be replaced. During this operation the hydraulics had failed, and the beam had fallen. However it had fallen only , back into its bearings; the witness did not think so small a drop would have damaged the beam; he had not seen any damage to the beam, and the engine had run well until the beam failure. It was also noted that there were casting defects visible at the fracture surface. As the coroner had foreseen, a second inquest was needed, and was held 4‚Äì6 February 1862. Sir George Grey, the Home Secretary (to whom the Mining Inspectorate reported) sent down an expert ((John) Kenyon Blackwell) to assist the coroner, Blackwell was to make a separate report on technical issues, and was to use the inquest as an opportunity to collect information for his own report. At the second inquest, a variety of experts and experienced men gave their opinions on the cause of the beam fracture. They differed over some details, but were in general agreement that the 'spears' linking the engine beam to the pumps it was operating had failed in tension (some held that this had been triggered by a pump piston jamming; others held that the failure occurred simply because the spear was in poor condition). With the load on the beam removed, there had been an abnormally fast and large stroke and the beam had hit equipment on the 'in-house' (steam engine) side of the beam with great force, the shock loading causing brittle failure of the cast iron. John Short the engine-wright gave the basic information about the engine, the beam, and the pump spears. The beam had been made nearby by Messrs Losh, Wilson and Bell of Walker. It had been assembled from three components. A central 'gudgeon' whose middle portion was hexagonal was threaded through a hexagonal hole in the central boss of two massive castings joined back-to-back with bolts, studs and spacers. Each casting had a thickness of at the central boss, and at the upper and lower edges with a web thickness of . The beam had an effective span of ; its greatest height was at the central boss; it weighed over 40 tons. The spears ran as a single main dry spear of square Memel pine to just above the high main. A 'Y' then connected the main spear both to the wet spear of the second stage pump, and to the square dry spear of the bottom pump. Coulson reported that the main spear had broken 12‚Äì14 feet below the bank; the bottom dry spear was broken at a 'spear plate' (junction piece) opposite the high main. From his examination, they had failed under tension (and therefore, he deduced, before the beam broke). John Hosking gave expert evidence on the pump beam. He pointed to weakness in the beam design and its installation. There was too much metal in the central boss and in ribs whose net effect was to weaken the beam. The orientation of the hexagonal holes (apexes at dead top and dead bottom) had both weakened the beam and given points from which a fracture could start. The beam had been secured on the gudgeon by driving wedges between them; from the hammer marks on the wedges this seemed to have been done with excessive force, which would have introduced undesirably high local stress. It would have been better ('modern practice') to machine the central boss holes and the middle portion of the 'gudgeon' circular, with better engineered keying between beam and 'gudgeon'. An ironfounder considered the iron of good quality; its strength was demonstrated by the irregularity of the fracture surface, and its quality by the colour of the fracture surface when fresh. There was no undue contraction. Hosking did not think a pump piston had wedged, the bottom spear had broken under normal load; \\"The wood does not appear to me to have been of very good quality. It might have been at one time, but is not now.\\" He dismissed as irrelevant two points which had attracted comment: * considerable voids ( x ) could be seen at the fracture surface close to the central boss; they were shrinkage voids, to be expected with so massive a casting unless special precautions were taken, and would not significantly affect the strength of the beam. * he did not think that the earlier drop had any connection with the subsequent failure: the beam had fallen only which he thought insufficient to initiate any fracture; the drop had occurred 33 days before the beam failed ‚Äì he did not think a significantly damaged beam would have survived so long; the fracture surface after the beam failure had been uniformly bright, which ruled out any slow progressive failure or partial previous failure. Blackwell's report to Grey (written a week after the inquest) concurred with Hosking and drew attention to factors which Blackwell felt had made the accident more likely than for most pumping engines; *at Hartley both 'inhouse up' and 'inhouse down' strokes were driven by the engine, whilst in the usual Cornish engine cycle for beam pumping engines, only the 'inhouse down' stroke was a power stroke, the return stroke being driven by the weight of the pump gear. On loss of load, therefore a Cornish engine would stall, whereas there was nothing to stop the Hartley engine over-speeding to its own destruction. *all three stages of pumping were carried out by bucket pumps; to ensure the bottom stage could be mended if it failed and the mine flooded, it had to be a bucket pump, but the other stages should have been plunger pumps to lessen the normal load on the beam *On bucket pumps heavy spears would add to the load on the pumping stroke; on plunger pumps heavy spears gave a quicker return stroke, and therefore there was always a tendency for bucket pumps to have less substantial spears. *Even with equally substantial spears bucket pumps were more liable to break their spears (and hence 'lose the load') than plunger pumps; either by deformation of the piston, or by obstruction of water flow into the pump, and it had been proved that the sump at the bottom of the shaft at Hartley had not been cleaned for a considerable time. Aftermath Told that all hope was lost, Queen Victoria (who was herself in mourning, having lost her husband, Prince Albert, only a month previously) sent a telegram of condolence, following it up by a letter: \\"Her Majesty commands me to say that her tenderest sympathy is with the widows and mothers, and that her own misery only makes her feel the more for them\\". In her personal journal she recorded: \\"The accounts of the colliery accident are terrible, ‚Äî such awful misery\\". The letter was read by clergy to the widows which was \\"a great comfort and a consolation to them\\". =Public response= The newspapers were struck not only by the misery of the widows, but by the Christian resignation of the victims, and the heroic determination of those attempting to rescue them: \\"Everyone must be struck by the good sense, the Christian principle, the intelligence, and bravery of many of the miners who have been brought into public notice by this disastrous event\\" said the Glasgow Morning Journal . Others were less restrained (and more chauvinistic); \\"Peril, imminent and unexpected, is the position in which the grandeur of British character stands forth in its full proportions. Give a terrible and stupendous disaster ‚Äì such a disaster as in some department of industrial enterprise almost every year brings us, and let British workmen be present in the scene, either as victims or spectators ‚Äì and the consequence will invariably be an exhibition of noble daring, or magnificent fortitude, or unselfish devotion, such as it is impossible to obtain under other circumstances.\\" thought the Athenaeum. =Medals and memorial= The heroism of the volunteers who attempted to rescue the victims was marked by a special medal, the Hartley Disaster Medal; it was struck in gold for Coulson and in silver for the sinkers, who were also given money in proportion to the hours they had spent in the shaft. An obelisk, commemorating those who died, was erected in the churchyard at St Alban's church in Earsdon. =Relief fund= The Queen's telegram of condolence, after expressing sympathy for the widows and orphans had asked 'what is doing for them?'. An appeal was set up to raise enough money to save them from destitution; it was thought that the victims had left 407 dependents, and that up to ¬£20,000 would have to be raised to provide for them. The British public responded generously; despite attempts to persuade them to give instead to other worthwhile causes, ¬£20,000 was raised in London alone; the total receipts of the Hartley Relief Fund came to ¬£83,000. A fuller reckoning of dependents including 26 posthumous children bought their number up to 467, but even on the most pessimistic assumptions, only ¬£55,000 was needed to provide for them, so in 1863 ¬£20,000 was distributed between the districts covered by each mining inspector, to be administered by local committees and applied for the relief of suffering caused by colliery accidents. The money provided financial backing for the first miners' relief societies, providing insurance against death or injury, whether in a disaster or incidental to routine operations (in 1862 it was estimated that for every million tons of coal produced, fifteen miners had died ). The Hartley Relief Fund was wound up in 1909; after buying annuities for the ten surviving dependents ¬£13,000 was left and went to the Northumberland and Durham Aged Miners' Homes Associations; the accommodation built with the money was to bear a suitable inscription. =Pit= Hester pit was never reopened. In 1874 a new colliery consisting of the Hastings and Melton pits was sunk nearby. In 1901 the low main workings of the old Hester pit were reentered, having been drained by a powerful pump. From 1929 onwards a series of takeovers and modernisations occurred until eventually in 1947 the new National Coal Board took over. Gradual decline followed with the whole colliery being abandoned in 1959 leaving a further 70 years (at peak production) worth of coal below ground. =Legislation= The inquest verdict given on 6 February 1862 was 'accidental death' with riders including: However, giving evidence, a prominent mining engineer had given as his opinion that \\"Parliament should pass an act this session\\" requiring two shafts, but that the materials used in colliery engines \\"might be left to the people who put up the engines. I myself think there will be no more cast-iron beams\\" and this view prevailed. On 7 August 1862, just 6 months after the inquest and less than 7 months from the disaster, an Act of Parliament (the Act to Amend the Law Relating to Coal Mines of 1862) was passed. This required all new mines to have two shafts and all existing mines to ensure access to a second shaft before the end of 1864; the maximum penalty was ¬£10, but the prohibition was enforcable by injunction. There was no similar legislation to outlaw the use of cast-iron beams in colliery pumping engines, but malleable iron beams became the rule in new installations. An 1863 paper describing a new pumping engine at Clay Cross noted that initially a cast-iron beam had been intended; after the New Hartley accident a wrought-iron beam was specified instead, adding ¬£480 to the cost of the engine (¬£3130 excluding boiler, engine house and pumps).

Life and work  Born at Plymouth, Massachusetts of a prominent New England family, he was a brother-in-law of Ralph Waldo Emerson and a graduate of the Harvard Medical School in 1829, where he won the Boylston prize for his dissertation. While at Harvard he made a geological exploration of Nova Scotia with his friend Francis Alger of Boston, which helped to increasingly turn his interests toward geology. In 1829 he traveled to Europe where he studied both medicine and geology for several years and made the acquaintance of prominent European scientists and physicians. Upon returning to the United States he played an active role in the new state geological survey movement, serving successively between 1836 and 1844 as the state geologist of Maine, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire. In 1844-45 he was an on- site mining consultant to the Lake Superior Copper Company, one of the first companies to attempt mining the native copper deposits of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula on Lake Superior. Charles Thomas Jackson In 1847 Jackson was appointed United States Geologist for the Lake Superior land district, which was about to become one of the major copper-producing regions of the world. His leadership of that survey proved to be a disaster, and he was dismissed from his position and the completion of the survey was turned over to his assistants John Wells Foster and Josiah Dwight Whitney. Jackson is particularly remembered for his involvement in a series of often bitter priority conflicts that left their marks on the scientific and social scenes of his day. They followed a standard pattern: a discovery would be announced by someone, Jackson would then claim prior discovery, and a controversy would ensue. Among them were conflicts over the discovery of guncotton (Christian Friedrich Sch√∂nbein), the telegraph (Samuel F. B. Morse), the digestive action of the stomach (William Beaumont), and the anesthetic effects of ether (William T. G. Morton). Jackson also made a similar priority claim (1849) for the discovery that the unusual native copper deposits of Lake Superior, contrary to all previous geological expectations, could be successfully mined, although at that time it was universally acknowledged that credit for that discovery belonged to the recently deceased Douglass Houghton, Michigan‚Äôs first state geologist. In this case, however, the historical evidence does indicate that Jackson‚Äôs claim for himself was valid, and his mineralogical insights were significantly in advance of those of his contemporaries, including Houghton. By 1873 Jackson was afflicted with mental illness, either through a seizure, or having a manic episode upon seeing Morton's tombstone, and spent the remainder of his life in the McLean Asylum, Somerville, Massachusetts, where he died on August 28, 1880. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as is one of his rivals, Dr. William T. G. Morton.
