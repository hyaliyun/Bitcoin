After the plot failed, Berthold was tried and executed by the Nazi regime. Early life Berthold was the oldest of four brothers (the second being Berthold's twin Alexander Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg) born into an old and distinguished aristocratic South German Catholic family. His parents were the last Oberhofmarschall of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, Alfred Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, and Caroline n√©e von √úxk√ºll-Gyllenband. Among his ancestors were several famous Prussians, including most notably August von Gneisenau. In his youth, he and his brothers were members of the Neupfadfinder, a German Scout association and part of the German Youth movement. After having studied law at T√ºbingen, he became assistant professor of international law at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Foreign and International Law in 1927. He and his brother Claus were introduced by Albrecht von Blumenthal to the circle of the mystic symbolist poet Stefan George, many of whose followers became members of the German Resistance to National Socialism. He worked at the Hague from 1930 to 1932 and in 1936 married Maria (Mika) Classen (1900‚Äì1977). They had two children: Alfred Claus Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (1937‚Äì1987) and Elisabeth Caroline Margarete Maria Schenk Gr√§fin von Stauffenberg (b. 13 June 1939). He lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee. Career and coup attempt In 1939, he joined the German Navy, working in the High Command as a staff judge and advisor for international law. Stauffenberg at the Volksgerichtshof Berthold's apartment at Tristanstra√üe in Berlin, where his brother Claus also lived for some time, was a meeting place for the 20 July conspirators, including their cousin Peter Yorck von Wartenburg. As Claus had access to the inner circle around Hitler, he was assigned to plant a bomb at the F√ºhrers briefing hut at the military high command in Rastenburg, East Prussia, on 20 July 1944. Claus then flew to Rangsdorf airfield south of Berlin where he met with Berthold. They went together to Bendlerstra√üe, which the coup leaders intended to use as the centre of their operations in Berlin. Hitler survived the bomb blast and the coup failed. Berthold and his brother were arrested at Bendlerstra√üe the same night. Claus was executed by firing squad shortly afterwards. After his arrest, Stauffenberg was questioned by the Gestapo about his views about the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". Stauffenberg told the Gestapo that ‚Äúhe and his brother had basically approved of the racial principle of National Socialism, but considered it to be 'exaggerated' and 'excessive'‚ÄùNoakes, Jeremy Nazism, Volume 4, University of Exeter Press, 1998 page 633 Stauffenberg went on to state, > The racial idea has been grossly betrayed in this war in that the best > German blood is being irrevocably sacrificed, while simultaneously Germany > is populated by millions of foreign workers, who certainly cannot be > described as of high racial quality. Berthold was tried in the Volksgerichtshof (\\"People's Court\\") by Roland Freisler on 10 August and was one of eight conspirators executed by strangulation, hanged in Pl√∂tzensee Prison, Berlin, later that day. Before he was killed Berthold was strangled and then revived multiple times. The entire execution and multiple resuscitations were filmed for Hitler to view at his leisure.

The Navy had awarded contracts for the first three S boats under the same general specifications but of different design types. S-1 was what was known as a \\"Holland-type\\", while was a \\"Lake-type\\" and a \\"Government- type\\". S-1s prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company, subcontracted her construction to the Fore River Shipbuilding Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. Her keel was laid down on 11 December 1917. She was launched on 26 October 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Emory S. Land, and commissioned on 5 June 1920, with Lieutenant Commander Thomas G. Berrien in command. Service history=United States Navy=Inter-war period S-1 began her service operations in July 1920 with a cruise to Bermuda attached to Submarine Division 2 (SubDiv 2), with subsequent operations out of New London, Connecticut, cruising the New England coast until 1923. S-1 On 2 January 1923, she shifted to SubDiv Zero, a division created for experimental work, and conducted winter maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. As a single-ship division, SubDiv Zero, she returned to New London in the spring to continue experimental duty. As part of a series of studies conducted by the United States Navy after World War I into the possibility of submarine-borne observation and scouting aircraft, S-1 became the experimental platform for this project late in 1923. She was altered by having a steel capsule mounted abaft the conning tower; a cylindrical pod which could house a small collapsible seaplane, the Martin MS-1. After surfacing, this plane could be rolled out, quickly assembled, and launched by ballasting the sub until the deck was awash. These experiments were carried out into 1926 using the Martin-built plane, constructed of wood and fabric, and the all-metal Cox-Klemin versions, XS-1 and XS-2. The first full cycle of surfacing, assembly, launching, retrieving, disassembly, and submergence took place on 28 July 1926, on the Thames River at New London. Following the aircraft experiments, S-1 served as flagship for SubDiv 2 until July 1927, when she was transferred to SubDiv 4\\\\. While attached to this division, she made operational cruises to the Panama Canal Zone in 1928‚Äì1930, during the spring months. She visited ports at Cristobal, Canal Zone and Coco Solo, Canal Zone; Cartagena, Colombia; Kingston, Jamaica; and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, during these cruises, and spent the remaining months of those years operating along the New England coast, out of New London. January 1931 found her at Pearl Harbor. She remained there into 1937; first, attached to SubDiv 7, SubRon 4, then, from July 1932 ‚Äì July 1933, attached to Rotating Reserve SubDiv 14\\\\. She was returned to SubDiv 7 in August, and remained with that division until departing in May 1937 for Philadelphia. S-1 arrived at Philadelphia on 22 July and commenced overhaul for deactivation. She was decommissioned on 20 October. World War II On 16 October 1940, S-1 was recommissioned at Philadelphia. She then made two cruises to Bermuda, training submariners, and returned to Philadelphia from the second cruise on 7 December 1941. There, she prepared for transfer to Britain under the Lend-Lease program. She was decommissioned and turned over to the British on 20 April 1942. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 June. =Royal Navy= S-1 served the Royal Navy as HMS P.552 as a training vessel for anti- submarine warfare. In poor condition after arriving in Durban, Natal, South Africa, she was often in repair and she was declared unseaworthy in January 1944.uboat.net ‚Äì Allied Warships ‚Äì Submarine HMS P 552 of the S-1 class She was returned to the U.S. Navy at Durban on 16 October 1944, where she was stripped of vital parts and machinery, and her hull was sold for local scrapping on 20 July 1945 and she was scrapped there on 14 September of that year.

It became a kingdom, which came into conflict with the Merovingian Franks, and it later came under their influence and Frankish control. The name is still used for one of modern Germany's federal states (Bundesl√§nder). First appearances Image from \\"Battle of Hermunduri and Chatti\\", 1717 The Thuringians do not appear in classical Roman texts under that name, but some have suggested that they were the remnants of the Suebic Hermanduri, the last part of whose name (-duri) could represent the same sound as (-thuri) and the Germanic suffix -ing, suggests a meaning of \\"descendants of (the [Herman]duri)\\".Schutz, 402. This people were living near the Marcomanni. Tacitus in his \\"Germania\\", describes their homeland as being where the Elbe starts, but also having colonies at the Danube and even within the Roman province of Rhaetia. Claudius Ptolemy mentions neither the Hermunduri nor the Thuringians in his geography but instead the Teuriochaemae (Turones, see list of ancient Germanic peoples and tribes), living in just north of the Sudetes mountains, thought to be the Erzgebirge. These may also be connected to later Thuringians. (\\"Chaemae\\" may represent a version of the Germanic word for \\"home\\". Ptolemy also mentions a people called the Bainochaimai to the west of the Elbe. He also apparently spells the name of the Chamavi in a similar way.) The formation of this people may have had also been influenced by two longer-known tribes more associated with the eastern bank of the lower Elbe river, northeast of Thuringia, because the Carolingian law code written for them was called the \\"law of the Angles and Varini that is the Thuringians\\". Much earlier, Tacitus in his \\"Germania\\", for example, had grouped these two tribes among the more distant Suebic tribes, living beyond the Elbe, and near a sea where they worshiped Herthus. (Pliny the Elder had listed the Varini as a Vandalic, or East Germanic tribe, rather than Suebian.) These two tribes are among Germanic groups known to have been found north of the Danube in this period. Procopius in his \\"Gothic Wars\\" describes the land of the Varini as being south of the Danes, but north of the Slavs, who were in turn north of the uncultivated lands which lay north of the Danube. Procopius describes a marriage alliance between the Angles of Britain and the Varni in the 6th century. The name of the Thuringians appears to be first mentioned in the veterinary treatise of Vegetius, written early in the 5th century.Guy Halsall, Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West 376-568, p.39, citing B. Schmidt. They appear in some lists of the peoples involved in Attila's invasion of Gaul. p.216 Walter Pohl has also proposed that they may be the same as the Turcilingi (or Torcolingi) who were one of the tribes near the middle Danube after the collapse of the empire of Attila, to whom they had apparently all been subject. They are specifically associated with Odoacer, who later became King of Italy, and are sometimes thought to have formed a part of the Scirii. Other tribes in this region at the time included the Rugii and the Heruls. Sidonius, in his 7th poem, explicitly lists them among the allies who fought under Attila when he entered Gaul in 451. During the reign of Childeric I, Gregory of Tours and Fredegar record that the Frankish King married the runaway wife of the King of the Thuringians, but the story may be distorted. (For example, the area of Tongeren, now in Belgium, may have been intended.Halsall p.392) More clearly, correspondence is recorded with a kingdom of Thuringians by Procopius and Cassiodorus during the reigns of Theoderic the Great (454‚Äì526) and Clovis I (approx. 466‚Äì511), after the downfall of Attila and Odoacer. Political history Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD. The Thuringii established an empire in the late 5th century. It reached its territorial peak in the first half of the 6th before it was conquered by the Franks in 531-532\\\\. Examination of Thuringian grave sites reveal cranial features which suggest the strong presence of Hunnic women or slaves, perhaps indicating that many Thuringians took Hunnic wives or Hunnic slaves following the collapse of the Hunnic Empire.Schutz, 411. There is also evidence from jewellery found in graves that the Thuringians sought marriages with Ostrogothic and Lombard women. Under the leadership of Alboin, a large group of Thuringii joined the Lombards on their migration into Italy. The Lombard king Agilulf (590-616) was of Thuringian descent. After their conquest, the Thuringii were placed under Frankish duces (dukes), but they rebelled and had regain their independence by the late 7th century under Radulf. Towards the end of this century, parts of Thuringia came under Saxon rule. By the time of Charles Martel and Saint Boniface, they were again subject to the Franks and ruled by Frankish dukes with their seat at W√ºrzburg in the south. Under Martel, the Thuringian dukes' authority was extended over a part of Austrasia and the Bavarian plateau. The valleys of the Lahn, Main, and Neckar rivers were included. The Naab formed the south-eastern border of Thuringia at the time. The Werra and Fulda valleys were within it also and it reached as far as the Saxon plain in the north. Its central location in Germania beyond the Rhine was the reason it became the point d'appui of Boniface's mission work. The Thuringii had a separate identity as late as 785-786, when one of their leading men, Hardrad, led an abortive insurrection against Charlemagne. The Carolingians codified the Thuringian legal customs (but perhaps did not use them extensively) as the Lex Thuringorum and continued to exact a tribute of pigs, presumably a Merovingian imposition, from the province. In the 10th century, under the Ottonians, the centre of Thuringian power lay in the north-east, near Erfurt. As late as the end of the 10th century, the porcine tribute was still being accepted by the King of Germany. Ecclesiastical history Christianity had reached the Thuringii in the 5th century, but their exposure to it was limited. Their real Christianisation took place, alongside the ecclesiastical organisation of their territory, during the early and mid 8th century under Boniface, who felled their \\"sacred oak\\" at Geismar in 724, abolishing the vestiges of their paganism. In the 1020s, Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz, began the minting of coins at Erfurt, the oldest market town in Thuringia with a history going back to the Merovingian period. The economy, especially trade (such as with the Slavs), greatly increased after that. Social history The Thuringian nobility, which had an admixture of Frankish, Thuringian, and Saxon blood, was not as landed as that of Francia. There was also a larger population of free peasant farmers than in Francia, though there was still a large number of serfs. The obligations of serfs there were also generally less oppressive. There were also fewer clergymen before Boniface came. There was a small number of artisans and merchants, mostly trading with the Slavs to the east. The town of Erfurt was the easternmost trading post in Frankish territory at the time. Historiography The history of the Thuringii is best known from the writings concerning their conquerors, the Franks. Gregory of Tours, a Gallo- Roman, includes the nearest account in time of the fall of the Thuringian Empire. Widukind of Corvey, writing in 10th-century Saxony, inundates his similar account with various legends. The Thuringii make brief appearances in contemporary Italian sources when their activities affect the land south of the Alps. Procopius, the Eastern Roman author, mentions them and speaks of their fall. The 7th-century Origo Gentis Langobardorum mentions a king of the Thuringii, Fisud, as a contemporary of Theudebert I.

His mastery of verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Vondel, Homer, Virgil and Dante. He wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work Os Lus√≠adas (The Lusiads). His collection of poetry The Parnasum of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes was lost in his lifetime. The influence of his masterpiece Os Lus√≠adas is so profound that Portuguese is sometimes called the \\"language of Cam√µes\\". Background Many details concerning the life of Cam√µes remain unknown, but he is thought to have been born around 1524. Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes was the only child of Sim√£o Vaz de Cam√µes and wife Ana de S√° de Macedo. His birthplace is disputed. Lisbon the capital where he died, Coimbra where he studied and Alenquer are frequently presented as his birthplace, based on interpretations of Lusiadas, which mentioned Alenquer several times, and the biographical poem (157) below. ‚ÄúNo mundo poucos anos, e cansados, vivi, cheios de vil mis√©ria dura; foi-me t√£o cedo a luz do dia escura, que n√£o vi cinco lustros acabados. Corri terras e mares apartados buscando √† vida algum rem√©dio ou cura; mas aquilo que, enfim, n√£o quer ventura, n√£o o alcan√ßam trabalhos arriscados. Criou-me Portugal na verde e cara p√°tria minha Alenquer; mas ar corruto que neste meu terreno vaso tinha, me fez manjar de peixes em ti, bruto mar, que bates na Ab√°ssia fera e avara, t√£o longe da ditosa p√°tria minha!‚Äù, Rendered in English, ‚ÄúIn this world only some few, tired years I lived, full of vile and hard misery; a dark light of day came to me so early, that I had not even been 25 years old. I traversed far-flung lands and seas seeking some medicine or cure to life; but that which, in the end, doesn't beget any luck, risky jobs do not reach. Portugal created me in my green and dear homeland Alenquer; but the corrupted air of this land in which I had planted, it made me now eat fish in you, rough sea, which strikes wild and mean on the Abassia, so far from my blessed homeland!‚Äú Even with this biographic poem stating that his homeland is Alenquer, there are still interests disputing his birth place. His mother Ana de S√° was also from Alenquer and also related to the famous humanist Dami√£o de Gois, also from Alenquer. Const√¢ncia has a museum about him where he was in jail for a time, for which they built a statue of him. It can be found in the town, but it‚Äôs not said in the Const√¢ncia that it was his homeland. The Cam√µes family was originally Galician, which then passed to the northern Portuguese region of Chaves near Galicia. At an early age, his father Sim√£o Vaz left his family to pursue personal riches in India, only to die in Goa in the following years. His mother later remarried. His mother was from Alenquer, daughter of Jorge de Macedo, and sister in law of Rui Dias de Gois from Alenquer. Monument to Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Lisbon Cam√µes lived a semi-privileged life and was educated by Dominicans and Jesuits. For a period, due to his familial relations he attended the University of Coimbra, although records do not show him registered (he participated in courses in the Humanities). His uncle, Bento de Cam√µes, is credited with this education, owing to his position as Prior at the Monastery of Santa Cruz and Chancellor at the University of Coimbra. He frequently had access to exclusive literature, including classical Greek, Roman and Latin works; he read Latin and Italian, and wrote poetry in Spanish. Cam√µes' tomb in the Jer√≥nimos Monastery, Bel√©m, Lisbon Cam√µes, as his love of poetry can attest, was a romantic and idealist. It was rumored that he fell in love with Catherine of Ata√≠de, lady-in-waiting to the Queen, and also Princess Maria, sister of John III of Portugal. It is also likely that an indiscreet allusion to the king in his play El-Rei Seleuco, as well as these other incidents, may have played a part in his exile from Lisbon in 1548. He traveled to the Ribatejo where he stayed in the company of friends who sheltered and fed him. He stayed in the province for about six months. He enlisted in the overseas militia, and traveled to Ceuta in the fall of 1549. During a battle with the Moors, he lost the sight in his right eye. He returned to Lisbon in 1551, a changed man, living a bohemian lifestyle. In 1552, during the religious festival of Corpus Christi, in the Largo do Rossio, he injured Gon√ßalo Borges, a member of the Royal Stables. Cam√µes was imprisoned. His mother pleaded for his release, visiting royal ministers and the Borges family for a pardon. Released, Cam√µes was ordered to pay 4,000 r√©is and serve three years in the militia in the Orient. He departed in 1553 for Goa on board the S√£o Bento, commanded by Fern√£o Alves Cabral. The ship arrived six months later. In Goa, Cam√µes was imprisoned for debt. He found Goa \\"a stepmother to all honest men\\", and he studied local customs and mastered the local geography and history. On his first expedition, he joined a battle along the Malabar Coast. The battle was followed by skirmishes along the trading routes between Egypt and India. The fleet eventually returned to Goa by November 1554. During his time ashore, he continued his writing publicly, as well as writing correspondence for the uneducated men of the fleet. A statue commemorating Cam√µes in Havana, Cuba At the end of his obligatory service, he was given the position of chief warrant officer in Macau. He was charged with managing the properties of missing and deceased soldiers in the Orient. During this time he worked on his epic poem Os Lus√≠adas (\\"The Lusiads\\") in a grotto. He was later accused of misappropriations and traveled to Goa to respond to the accusations of the tribunal. During his return journey, near the Mekong River along the Cambodian coast, he was shipwrecked, saving his manuscript but losing his Chinese lover, Dinamene. His shipwreck survival in the Mekong Delta was enhanced by the legendary detail that he succeeded in swimming ashore while holding aloft the manuscript of his still-unfinished epic. In 1570 Cam√µes finally made it back to Lisbon, where two years later he published Os Lus√≠adas, for which he was considered one of the most prominent Iberian poets at the time.Aguiar e Silva (2011, \\"C√¢none liter√°rio portugu√™s e Cam√µes (O)\\"). Historian Pero de Magalh√£es G√¢ndavo wrote in 1574 that \\"time will never triumph over Cam√µes's fame\\" (idem, ibidem) In recompense for this poem or perhaps for services in the Far East, he was granted a small royal pension (15000 r√©is) by the young and ill-fated King Sebastian (ruled 1557‚Äì1578). In 1578 he heard of the appalling defeat of the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir, where King Sebastian was killed and the Portuguese army destroyed. The Castilian troops were approaching Lisbon when Cam√µes wrote to the Captain General of Lamego: \\"All will see that so dear to me was my country that I was content to die not only in it but with it\\". Cam√µes died in Lisbon in 1580, at the age of 56. The day of his death, 10 June OS, is Portugal's national day. He is entombed in the Santa Maria church, part of the Jer√≥nimos Monastery complex, near Vasco da Gama, in the parish of Bel√©m in Lisbon.

It is built on islands in a lake formed by the River Len to the east of the village of Leeds. A castle has existed on the site since 1119, the first being a simple stone stronghold constructed by Robert de Crevecoeur which served as a military post in the time of Norman intrusions into England. In the 13th century it came into the hands of King Edward I, for whom it became a favourite residence; in the 16th century, Henry VIII used it as a dwelling for his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. The present castle dates mostly from the 19th century. It has been open to the public since 1976. History=Medieval and Tudor= An aerial panorama of Leeds Castle From 857 the site was owned by a Saxon chief called Led or Leed who built a wooden structure on two islands in the middle of the River Len. In 1119 Robert de Crevecoeur rebuilt it in stone as a Norman stronghold and Leeds Castle descended through the de Crevecoeur family until the 1260s. What form this Norman stronghold took is uncertain because it was rebuilt and transformed in the following centuries. Adrian Pettifer speculates that it may have been a motte and bailey. In 1278, the castle was bought by King Edward I's Queen, Eleanor of Castile. As a favoured residence of Edward's, it saw considerable investment. The king enhanced its defences, and it was probably Edward who created the lake that surrounds the castle. A barbican spanning three islands was also built and a gloriette with apartments for the king and queen was added. In the Late Middle Ages, the growth of the royal household meant fewer residences could accommodate the monarchy when they visited. As a result, expenditure on royal residences in south east England generally decreased except for the Tower of London and Windsor Castle. The activity at Leeds Castle during the reign of Edward I was a notable exception to this pattern. The castle was captured on 31 October 1321 by the forces of Edward II from Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, wife of the castle's constable, Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, who had left her in charge during his absence. The King had besieged Leeds after she had refused Edward's consort Isabella of France admittance in her husband's absence; when the latter sought to force an entry, Lady Badlesmere instructed her archers to fire upon Isabella and her party, six of whom were killed. Lady Badlesmere was kept prisoner in the Tower of London until November 1322. note 3 After Edward II died in 1327 his widow took over Leeds Castle as her primary residence. Richard II's first wife, Anne of Bohemia, spent the winter of 1381 at the castle on her way to be married to the king. In 1395, Richard received the French chronicler Jean Froissart there, as described in Froissart's Chronicles. Henry VIII transformed the castle in 1519 for his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. A painting commemorating his meeting with Francis I of France still hangs there. In 1552 Leeds Castle was granted to Sir Anthony St Leger (d.1559) of Ulcombe, Kent, whose grandfather Ralph I St Leger (d.1470), of Ulcombe, Sheriff of Kent in 1467/8, had been Constable of Leeds Castle. =17th and 18th centuries= The castle escaped destruction during the English Civil War because its owner, Sir Cheney Culpeper, sided with the Parliamentarians. The castle was used as both an arsenal and a prison during the war. Other members of the Culpeper family had sided with the Royalists, John, 1st Lord Culpeper, having been granted more than of land in Virginia in reward for assisting the escape of the king's son, Charles, the Prince of Wales. This legacy was to prove vital for the castle's fortunes. Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron was born at the castle in 1693 and settled in North America to oversee the Culpeper estates, cementing an ongoing connection between the castle and America. There is a commemorative sundial at the castle telling the time in Belvoir, Virginia and a corresponding sundial in America. Fairfax was the great grandson of Thomas Fairfax who led the parliamentarian attack at the nearby Battle of Maidstone in 1648 and whose doublet worn during the battle is on display. =19th century= The new castle was completed in 1823 in the Tudor style. Robert Fairfax owned the castle for 46 years until 1793 when it passed to the Wykeham Martins. Sale of the family estates in Virginia released a large sum of money that allowed extensive repair and the remodelling of the castle in a Tudor style, completed in 1823, that resulted in the appearance today. =20th century= The last private owner of the castle was the Hon. Olive, Lady Baillie, daughter of Almeric Paget, 1st Baron Queenborough and his first wife, Pauline Payne Whitney, an American heiress. Lady Baillie bought the castle in 1926 for ¬£180,000. She redecorated the interior, first working with the French architect and designer Armand-Albert Rateau, who oversaw exterior alterations and added interior features such as a 16th-century-style carved-oak staircase, then with the Paris decorator St√©phane Boudin. During the early part of World War II the castle was used as a hospital where Lady Baillie and her daughters hosted burned Commonwealth airmen as part of their recovery. Survivors remembered the experience with fondness. Upon her death in 1974, Lady Baillie left the castle to the Leeds Castle Foundation, a private charitable trust whose aim is to preserve the castle and grounds for the benefit of the public. An estimated ¬£1.4 million was invested and a further ¬£400,000 was retrieved from the sale of the furniture to make improvements to the Castle and attract paying corporate conferences. However, it was quickly understood that it could not support the ongoing costs of running the Estate, so in 1975 the gardens were opened to the public, and the following year the Castle was also made available to visitors. On 17 July 1978, the castle was the site of a meeting between the Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohammed Ibrahim Karmel and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Cyrus Vance of the US in preparation for the Camp David Accords. The castle also hosted the Northern Ireland peace talks held in September 2004 led by Tony Blair. Tourism The maze at Leeds Castle was made with 2,400 yew trees and was opened in 1988. An aviary was added in 1980 and by 2011 it contained over 100 species, but it was decided to close it in October 2012 as it was felt the foundation could make better use of the ¬£200,000 a year it cost to keep the aviary running. The castle and its grounds are a major leisure destination with a maze that is exited through a shell grotto, a golf course and what may be the world's only museum of dog collars. There are two castle-themed children's adventure play areas targeted at the under sevens and the under fourteens. It is a Grade I listed building (first listed in 1952) and recognised as an internationally important structure. In 1998 Leeds Castle was one of 57 heritage sites in England to receive more than 200,000 visitors. According to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, 465,706 people visited the castle in 2018. Film location The castle was a location for the 1949 Ealing Comedy film Kind Hearts and Coronets, where it stood in for 'Chalfont', ancestral home of the aristocratic d'Ascoyne family. It also appeared in the films The Moonraker (1958) and Waltz of the Toreadors (1962). On the small screen, the castle and grounds provided all the filming locations for a Doctor Who serial, The Androids of Tara, in 1978.

The Philadelphia native played in the Negro leagues and Mexican League for 9 years before entering the minor leagues in 1946. He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in 1948 for the Brooklyn Dodgers, for whom he played until 1957. His playing career ended when he was paralyzed in an automobile accident in January 1958. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest catchers in the history of the game. After he retired as a player as a result of the accident, Campanella held positions in scouting and community relations with the Dodgers. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969. Early life and education He was born Roy Campanella in Philadelphia to parents Ida, who was African American, and John Campanella, son of Italian immigrants.Jackie & Campy by William C. Kashatus, pp. 44 Roy was one of four children born to the couple. They first lived in Germantown, and then moved to Nicetown in North Philadelphia, where the children attended integrated schools. Because of their mixed race, he and his siblings were sometimes harassed by other children in school. But Campanella had athletic gifts that he used to great effect. He was elected captain of every sport team he played on in high school, but baseball was his passion. Playing career=Negro leagues= Of mixed race, Campanella was considered on the wrong side of the baseball color line and prohibited from MLB play. He dropped out of high school on his 16th birthday and began playing Negro league baseball in 1937 for the Washington Elite Giants. The Elite Giants moved to Baltimore the following year,Baltimore Elite Giants Negro League Baseball Players Association website and Campanella became a star player with the team. =Mexican League= In 1942 and 1943, Campanella played in the Mexican League with the Monterrey Sultans. L√°zaro Salazar, the team's manager, told Campanella that one day he would play at the major league level. =Minor leagues= Campanella moved into the Brooklyn Dodgers' minor league system in as the Dodger organization began preparations to break the MLB color barrier with Jackie Robinson. His easy-going personality and strong work ethic were credited with his being able to move successfully between the races. Although Branch Rickey considered hiring Campanella to break baseball's color barrier, Rickey ultimately decided upon Robinson.Jackie & Campy by William C Kashatus, pp, 65-68 &75 For the 1946 season, Robinson was assigned to the Montreal Royals, the Dodgers' affiliate in the Class AAA International League. On March 18, 1946, Campanella signed a contract to play for Danville Dodgers of the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League. After the general manager of the Danville Dodgers reported that he did not feel the league was ready for racial integration, the organization sent Campanella and pitcher Don Newcombe to the Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England League, where the Dodgers felt the climate would be more tolerant. The Nashua team thus became the first professional baseball team of the 20th century to field a racially integrated lineup in the United States. Campanella's 1946 season proceeded largely without racist incidents, and in one game Campanella assumed the managerial duties after manager Walter Alston was ejected. Campanella was the first African American to manage Caucasian players of an organized professional baseball team. Nashua was three runs down at the time Campanella took over. They came back to win, in part due to Campanella's decision to use Newcombe as a pinch hitter during the seventh inning; Newcombe hit a game-tying two-run home run. =Major League Baseball= Campanella about 1953. Jackie Robinson's first season in the major leagues came in 1947, and Campanella began his MLB career with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following season, playing his first game on April 20, 1948. In later years, Robinson and his wife sometimes stayed with the Campanella family during some ballgames because adequate hotels for blacks could not be found in the city. Campanella played for the Dodgers from through as their regular catcher. In 1948, he had three different uniform numbers (33, 39, and 56) before settling on 39 for the rest of his career. Campanella was selected to the All-Star Game every year from through . With his 1949 All-Star selection, he was one of the first four African Americans so honored.

Campanella seen shaving in a TV commercial for Gillette Razors. Campanella received the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in the National League three times: in , , and . In each of his MVP seasons, he batted more than .300, hit more than 30 home runs, and had more than 100 runs batted in. His 142 RBI during 1953 exceeded the franchise record of 130, which had been held by Jack Fournier () and Babe Herman (). Today it is the second most in franchise history, Tommy Davis breaking it with 153 RBI in . That same year, Campanella hit 40 home runs in games in which he appeared as a catcher, a record that lasted until , when it was exceeded by Todd Hundley. During his career, he threw out 57% of the base runners who tried to steal a base on him, the highest by any catcher in major league history.100 Best Catcher CS% Totals at The Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers Campanella had five of the seven top caught stealing percentages for a single season in major league history. In 1955 (Campanella's final MVP season), he helped Brooklyn win its first-ever World Series championship. After the Dodgers lost the first two games of the series to the Yankees, Campanella began Brooklyn's comeback by hitting a two- out, two-run home run in the first inning of Game 3. The Dodgers won that game, got another home run from Campanella in a Game 4 victory that tied the series, and then went on to claim the series in seven games when Johnny Podres shutout the Yankees 2-0 in Game 7. Campanella caught three no-hitters during his career: Carl Erskine's two on June 19, and May 12, and Sal Maglie's on September 25, 1956. \\"In my no-hitter...I only shook Campy off once,\\" Maglie recalled. \\"He was doing the thinking, calling the pitches just right for every batter in every situation, and all I had to do was check the sign to see if I agreed and then throw.\\" After the 1957 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles and became the Los Angeles Dodgers, but Campanella's playing career came to an end as a result of an automobile accident. He never played a game for Los Angeles. Automobile accident Watercolor of Howard Rusk with Campanella during the latter's rehabilitation. Campanella lived in Glen Cove, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island; he operated a liquor store in Harlem between regular-season games and during the off-season. After closing the store for the night on January 28, 1958, he began his drive home to Glen Cove. While he was traveling at about , his rented 1957 Chevrolet sedan hit a patch of ice at an S-curve on Dosoris Lane near Apple Tree Lane in Glen Cove, skidded into a telephone pole, and overturned, breaking Campanella's neck.

The attendance at the game was 93,103, setting a record at that time for the largest crowd to attend a Major League Baseball game. The proceeds from the game went to defray Campanella's medical bills. During , Campanella was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the second player of black heritage so honored, after Jackie Robinson. The same year, he received the Bronze Medallion from the City of New York. Campanella was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall Of Fame in 1971.Campanella's biography page on the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame website (Spanish) On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired Campanella's uniform number 39 alongside Jackie Robinson's number 42 and Sandy Koufax's number 32. In 1978, Campanella moved to California and accepted a job with the Dodgers as assistant to the director of community relations, Don Newcombe, his former teammate and longtime friend. Representation in other media Willie Mays with Roy Campanella (1961) Campanella was interviewed by Edward R. Murrow on the CBS program Person to Person on October 2, 1953 and again on January 2, 1959. Campanella also appeared as Mystery Guest on What's My Line? episode 171 on September 6, 1953 and as a guest celebrity on The Name's the Same (ABC-TV) on July 27, 1954. Campanella was also mentioned in the lyrics of the song \\"Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit that Ball?\\", written and recorded by Buddy Johnson in 1949 (and covered by Count Basie and his Orchestra that same year) and in the lyrics to the song \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" by Billy Joel. Campanella was also honored on the famous Ralph Edwards show This Is Your Life. Campanella appeared as himself in the Lassie episode \\"The Mascot\\", first broadcast September 27, 1959, in a story where he is coaching Timmy Martin's \\"Boys' League\\" team. Marriages and family Campanella was married three times. His first marriage, to Bernice Ray on January 3, 1939, ended in divorce. They had two daughters together. On April 30, 1945, he married Ruthe Willis, who brought her son David to the marriage. They had three children together (including a son, Roy Campanella II, who became a television director). Their marriage deteriorated after Campanella's accident and was never the same; they separated in 1960. Ruthe died of a heart attack at age 40 in January 1963. Campanella's adopted son David had a somewhat troubled life; he was arrested a number of times, developed a problem with drugs, and died at the age of 41. On May 5, 1964, Campanella married Roxie Doles, who survived him. Death Campanella died of heart failure at age 71 on June 26, 1993, at his home in Woodland Hills, California. He was cremated at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. Legacy In 1999, Campanella ranked number 50 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. The book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. He features Campanella in many of these stories. Campanella wrote his autobiography, It's Good to Be Alive, which was published in 1959; he discussed his convalescence and partial recovery after his accident. Michael Landon directed a TV-movie based on the book, It's Good to Be Alive (1974), which was considerably fictionalized. Campanella was portrayed by Paul Winfield. Campanella was featured on a United States postage stamp in 2006.Campanella stamp. ‚Äì USPS The stamp is one of a block of four honoring baseball sluggers, the others being Mickey Mantle, Hank Greenberg, and Mel Ott. In September 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced the creation of the Roy Campanella Award. The club's players and coaches vote on it annually, and is given to the Dodger who best exemplifies \\"Campy's\\" spirit and leadership. Shortstop Rafael Furcal was named the inaugural winner of the award. Simon & Schuster published a 2011 biography of Campanella written by Neil Lanctot, author of Negro League Baseball ‚Äì The Rise and Ruin of a Black Institution. The book is entitled Campy ‚Äì The Two Lives of Roy Campanella. The book reveals new details about Campanella's near-fatal car accident and his volatile relationship with Jackie Robinson. It also provides the most comprehensive look at Campanella's Negro league career, including newly compiled year-by-year statistics.

Admiralty law consists of both domestic law on maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private parties operating or using ocean-going ships. While each legal jurisdiction usually has its own legislation governing maritime matters, the international nature of the topic and the need for uniformity has, since 1900, led to considerable international maritime law developments, including numerous multilateral treaties. Admiralty law may be distinguished from the Law of the Sea, which is a body of public international law dealing with navigational rights, mineral rights, jurisdiction over coastal waters, and the maritime relationships between nations. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been adopted by 167 countries and the European Union, and disputes are resolved at the ITLOS tribunal in Hamburg. History Seaborne transport was one of the earliest channels of commerce, and rules for resolving disputes involving maritime trade were developed early in recorded history. Early historical records of these laws include the Rhodian law (Nomos Rhodion Nautikos), of which no primary written specimen has survived, but which is alluded to in other legal texts (Roman and Byzantine legal codes), and later the customs of the Consulate of the Sea or the Hanseatic League. In southern Italy the Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris (1063) at Trani and the Amalfian Laws were in effect from an early date. Bracton noted further that admiralty law was also used as an alternative to the common law in Norman England, which previously required voluntary submission to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court. A leading sponsor of admiralty law in Europe was the French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor (sometimes known as \\"Eleanor of Guyenne‚Äù) had learned about admiralty law whilst on a crusade in the eastern Mediterranean with her first husband, King Louis VII of France. Eleanor then established admiralty law on the island of Oleron, where it was published as the \\"Rolls of Oleron\\". Some time later, while she was in London acting as regent for her son, King Richard the Lionheart, Eleanor instituted admiralty law into England as well. In England, a special Admiralty Court handles all admiralty cases. Despite early reliance upon civil law concepts derived from the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian, the English Admiralty Court is a common law, albeit sui generis court that was initially somewhat distanced from other English courts. After around 1750, as the industrial revolution took hold and English maritime commerce burgeoned, the Admiralty Court became a proactive source of innovative legal ideas and provisions to meet the new situation. The Judicature Acts of 1873-1875 abolished the Admiralty Court as such, and it became conflated in the new \\"Probate, Divorce & Admiralty\\" division of the High Court. However, when the PDA was abolished and replaced by a new \\"Family Division\\", admiralty jurisdiction passed to a so-called \\"Admiralty Court\\" which was effectively the QBD sitting to hear nautical cases. The Senior Courts Act 1981 then clarified the \\"admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court\\", so England once again has a distinct Admiralty Court (albeit no longer based in the Royal Courts of Justice, but in the Rolls Building). English Admiralty courts were a prominent feature in the prelude to the American Revolution. For example, the phrase in the Declaration of Independence \\"For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury\\" refers to the practice of the UK Parliament giving the Admiralty Courts jurisdiction to enforce The Stamp Act in the American Colonies.See the Stamp Act, March 22, 1765, D. Pickering, Statutes at Large, Vol. XXVI, p. 179 ff (clause LVII relates to jurisdiction in admiralty). This power has been awarded because the Stamp Act was unpopular in America, so that a colonial jury would be unlikely to convict any colonist of its violation. However, since English admiralty courts have never had trial by jury, a colonist charged with breaching the Stamp Act could be more easily convicted by the Crown. Admiralty law was gradually became part of American Law through admiralty cases arising after the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1789. Many American lawyers who were prominent in the American Revolution were admiralty and maritime lawyers. Those included are Alexander Hamilton in New York and John Adams in Massachusetts. In 1787 Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison proposing that the U.S. Constitution, then under consideration by the States, be amended to include \\"trial by jury in all matters of fact triable by the laws of the land and not by the laws of Nations\\". The result was the United States Bill of Rights.Hofstadter, Richard. Great Issues in American History: 1765 1865. v.2. 1864 1957. United States, Vintage Books, 1958. Alexander Hamilton and John Adams were both admiralty lawyers and Adams represented John Hancock in an admiralty case in colonial Boston involving seizure of one of Hancock's ships for violations of Customs regulations. In the more modern era, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was an admiralty lawyer before ascending to the bench. Features Matters dealt by admiralty law include marine commerce, marine navigation, salvage, maritime pollution, seafarers‚Äô rights, and the carriage by sea of both passengers and goods. Admiralty law also covers land-based commercial activities that are maritime in character, such as marine insurance. Some lawyers prefer to reserve the term ‚Äúadmiralty law‚Äù for ‚Äúwet law‚Äù (e.g. salvage, collisions, ship arrest, towage, liens and limitation), and use ‚Äúmaritime law‚Äù only for ‚Äúdry law‚Äù (e.g. carriage of goods & people, marine insurance, and the MLC). =Maintenance and cure= The doctrine of maintenance and cure is rooted in Article VI of the Rolls of Oleron promulgated in about 1160 A.D. The obligation to \\"cure\\" requires a shipowner to provide medical care free of charge to a seaman injured in the service of the ship, until the seaman has reached \\"maximum medical cure\\". The concept of \\"maximum medical cure\\" is more extensive than the concept \\"maximum medical improvement\\". The obligation to \\"cure\\" a seaman includes the obligation to provide him with medications and medical devices which improve his ability to function, even if they don't \\"improve\\" his actual condition. They may include long-term treatments that permit him to continue to function well. Common examples include prostheses, wheelchairs, and pain medications. The obligation of \\"maintenance\\" requires the shipowner to provide a seaman with his basic living expenses while he is convalescing. Once a seaman is able to work, he is expected to maintain himself. Consequently, a seaman can lose his right to maintenance, while the obligation to provide cure is ongoing. A seaman who is required to sue a shipowner to recover maintenance and cure may also recover his attorneys fees. Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369 U.S. 527 (1962). If a shipowner's breach of its obligation to provide maintenance and cure is willful and wanton, the shipowner may be subject to punitive damages. See Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U.S. 404 (2009)(J. Thomas). =Personal injuries to passengers= Shipowners owe a duty of reasonable care to passengers. Consequently, passengers who are injured aboard ships may bring suit as if they had been injured ashore through the negligence of a third party. The passenger bears the burden of proving that the shipowner was negligent. While personal injury cases must generally be pursued within three years, suits against cruise lines may need to be brought within one year because of limitations contained in the passenger ticket. Notice requirements in the ticket may require a formal notice to be brought within six months of the injury. Most U.S. cruise line passenger tickets also have provisions requiring that suit to be brought in either Miami or Seattle. In England, the 1954 case of Adler v Dickson (The Himalaya) [1954]Adler v Dickson [1954] 2 LLR 267, [1955] 1 QB 158 allowed a shipping line to escape liability when a bosun's negligence resulted in a passenger being injured. Since then, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 has made it unlawful to exclude liability for death or personal injury caused by one's negligence. (Since then, however, the so- called \\"Himalaya clause\\" has become a useful way for a contractor to pass on the protection of a limitation clause to his employees, agents and third-party contractors). =Maritime liens and mortgages= Banks which loan money to purchase ships, vendors who supply ships with necessaries like fuel and stores, seamen who are due wages, and many others have a lien against the ship to guarantee payment. To enforce the lien, the ship must be arrested or seized. In the United States, an action to enforce a lien against a U.S. ship must be brought in federal court and cannot be done in state court, except for under the reverse-Erie doctrine whereby state courts can apply federal law. =Salvage and treasure salvage= When property is lost at sea and rescued by another, the rescuer is entitled to claim a salvage award on the salvaged property. There is no \\"life salvage\\". All mariners have a duty to save the lives of others in peril without expectation of reward. Consequently, salvage law applies only to the saving of property. There are two types of salvage: contract salvage and pure salvage, which is sometimes referred to as \\"merit salvage\\". In contract salvage the owner of the property and salvor enter into a salvage contract prior to the commencement of salvage operations and the amount that the salvor is paid is determined by the contract. The most common salvage contract is called a \\"Lloyd's Open Form Salvage Contract\\". In pure salvage, there is no contract between the owner of the goods and the salvor. The relationship is one which is implied by law. The salvor of property under pure salvage must bring his claim for salvage in court, which will award salvage based upon the \\"merit\\" of the service and the value of the salvaged property. Pure salvage claims are divided into \\"high-order\\" and \\"low-order\\" salvage. In high-order salvage, the salvor exposes himself and his crew to the risk of injury and loss or damage to his equipment to salvage the damaged ship. Examples of high-order salvage are boarding a sinking ship in heavy weather, boarding a ship which is on fire, raising a ship or boat which has already sunk, or towing a ship which is in the surf away from the shore. Low- order salvage occurs where the salvor is exposed to little or no personal risk. Examples of low-order salvage include towing another vessel in calm seas, supplying a vessel with fuel, or pulling a vessel off a sand bar. Salvors performing high order salvage receive substantially greater salvage award than those performing low order salvage. In both high-order and low- order salvage the amount of the salvage award is based first upon the value of the property saved. If nothing is saved, or if additional damage is done, there will be no award. The other factors to be considered are the skills of the salvor, the peril to which the salvaged property was exposed, the value of the property which was risked in effecting the salvage, the amount of time and money expended in the salvage operation etc. A pure or merit salvage award will seldom exceed 50 percent of the value of the property salved. The exception to that rule is in the case of treasure salvage. Because sunken treasure has generally been lost for hundreds of years, while the original owner (or insurer, if the vessel was insured) continues to have an interest in it, the salvor or finder will generally get the majority of the value of the property. While sunken ships from the Spanish Main (such as Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha in the Florida Keys) are the most commonly thought of type of treasure salvage, other types of ships including German submarines from World War II which can hold valuable historical artifacts, American Civil War ships (the USS Maple Leaf in the St. Johns River, and the CSS Virginia in Chesapeake Bay), and sunken merchant ships (the SS Central America off Cape Hatteras) have all been the subject of treasure salvage awards. Due to refinements in side-scanning sonars, many ships which were previously missing are now being located and treasure salvage is now a less risky endeavor than it was in the past, although it is still highly speculative and expensive. International conventions Prior to the mid-1970s, most international conventions concerning maritime trade and commerce originated in a private organization of maritime lawyers known as the Comit√© Maritime International (International Maritime Committee or CMI). Founded in 1897, the CMI was responsible for the drafting of numerous international conventions including the Hague Rules (International Convention on Bills of Lading), the Visby Amendments (amending the Hague Rules), the Salvage Convention and many others. While the CMI continues to function in an advisory capacity, many of its functions have been taken over by the International Maritime Organization, which was established by the United Nations in 1958 but did not become truly effective until about 1974. The IMO has prepared numerous international conventions concerning maritime safety including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the Standards for Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW), the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (Collision Regulations or COLREGS), Maritime Pollution Regulations (MARPOL), International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Convention (IAMSAR) and others. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defined a treaty regarding protection of the marine environment and various maritime boundaries. Restrictions on international fishing such as International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling also form part of the body of conventions in international waters. Other commercial conventions include the \\"International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships\\", Brussels, 10 October 1957.‚ÄúInternational Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of Owners of Sea-Going Ships, and Protocol of Signature. ATS 2 of 1981‚Äù . Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017. and International Convention for Safe Containers.‚ÄúInternational Convention for Safe Containers. ATS 3 of 1981‚Äù . Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Once adopted, most international conventions are enforced by the individual signatory nations, either through their Port State Control, or through their national courts. Cases within the ambit of the European Union's EMSA may be heard by the CJEU in Luxembourg. By contrast, disputes involving the Law of the Sea may be resolved at ITLOS in Hamburg, provided that the parties are signatories to UNCLOS. Piracy Merchant vessels transiting areas of increased pirate activity (i.e. the Gulf of Aden, Somali Basin, Southern Red Sea and Bab-el-Mandeb straits) are advised to implement self-protective measures, in accordance with most recent best management practices agreed upon by the members of the merchant industry and endorsed by the NATO Shipping Centre, and the Maritime Security Centre Horn-of-Africa (MSCHOA).NATO Shipping Centre (www.shipping.nato.int) Individual countries The common law of England and Wales, of Northern Ireland law, and of US law, contrast to the continental law (civil law) that prevails in Scottish law and in continental Europe, which trace back to Roman law. Although the English Admiralty court was a development of continental civil law, the Admiralty Court of England and Wales was a common law court, albeit somewhat distanced from the mainstream King's Bench. Most of the common law countries (including Pakistan, Singapore, India, and many other Commonwealth of Nations countries) follow English statute and case law. India still follows many Victorian-era British statutes such as the Admiralty Court Act 1861 [24 Vict c 10]. Whilst Pakistan now has its own statute, the Admiralty Jurisdiction of High Courts Ordinance, 1980 (Ordinance XLII of 1980), it also follows English case law. One reason for this is that the 1980 Ordinance is partly modelled on old English admiralty law, namely the Administration of Justice Act 1956. The current statute dealing with the Admiralty jurisdiction of the England and Wales High Court is the Senior Courts Act 1981, ss. 20‚Äì24, 37. The provisions in those sections are, in turn, based on the International Arrest Convention 1952. Other countries which do not follow the English statute and case laws, such as Panama, also have established well-known maritime courts which decide international cases on a regular basis. Admiralty courts assume jurisdiction by virtue of the presence of the vessel in its territorial jurisdiction irrespective of whether the vessel is national or not and whether registered or not, and wherever the residence or domicile or their owners may be. A vessel is usually arrested by the court to retain jurisdiction. State-owned vessels are usually immune from arrest. =Canada= Canadian jurisdiction in the area of navigation and shipping is vested in the Parliament of Canada by virtue of s. 91(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Canada has adopted an expansive definition of its maritime law, which goes beyond traditional admiralty law. The original English admiralty jurisdiction was called \\"wet\\", as it concerned itself with things done at sea, including collisions, salvage and the work of mariners, and contracts and torts performed at sea. Canadian law has added \\"dry\\" jurisdiction to this field, which includes such matters as: * stevedoring, * marine insurance, * warehousing and security services, * contracts of agency, and * contracts of carriage. This list is not exhaustive of the subject matter. Canadian jurisdiction was originally consolidated in 1891, with subsequent expansions in 1934 following the passage of the Statute of Westminster 1931, and in 1971 with the extension to \\"dry\\" matters. Recent jurisprudence at the Supreme Court of Canada has tended to expand the maritime law power, thus overriding prior provincial laws based on the provinces' power over property and civil rights. =United States=Jurisdiction Article III, Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants original jurisdiction to U.S. federal courts over admiralty and maritime matters; however, that jurisdiction is not exclusive, and most maritime cases can be heard in either state or federal courts under the \\"saving to suitors\\" clause. There are five types of cases which can only be brought in federal court: * limitation of shipowner's liability, * vessel arrests in rem, * property arrests quasi in rem, * salvage cases, and * petitory and possession actions. The common element of those cases are that they require the court to exercise jurisdiction over maritime property. For example, in a petitory and possession action, a vessel whose title is in dispute, usually between co-owners, will be put in the possession of the court until the title dispute can be resolved. In a limitation action, the shipowner will post a bond reflecting the value of the vessel and her pending freight. A sixth category, that of prize, relating to claims over vessels captured during wartime, has been rendered obsolete due to changes in the laws and practices of warfare. Aside from those five types of cases, all other maritime cases, such as claims for personal injuries, cargo damage, collisions, maritime products liability, and recreational boating accidents may be brought in either federal or state court. From a tactical standpoint it is important to consider that in federal courts in the United States, there is generally no right to trial by jury in admiralty cases, although the 1920 Jones Act grants a jury trial to seamen suing their employers. Maritime law is governed by a uniform three-year statute of limitations for personal injury and wrongful death cases. Cargo cases must be brought within two years (extended from the one-year allowance under the Hague-Visby Rules), pursuant to the adoption of the Rotterdam Rules.Rotterdam Rules: Interpretation. Most major cruise ship passenger tickets have a one- year statute of limitations. Applicable law A state court hearing an admiralty or maritime case is required to apply the admiralty and maritime law, even if it conflicts with the law of the state, under a doctrine known as the \\"reverse-Erie doctrine\\". While the \\"Erie doctrine\\" requires that federal courts hearing state actions must apply substantive state law, the \\"reverse- Erie doctrine\\" requires state courts hearing admiralty cases to apply substantive federal admiralty law. However, state courts are allowed to apply state procedural law.Joseph R. Oliveri (2008). \\"Converse-Erie: The Key to Federalism in an Increasingly Administrative State\\" (essay). This change can be significant. Features of U.S. admiralty law=Cargo claims= Claims for damage to cargo shipped in international commerce are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a shipowner is liable for cargo damaged from \\"hook to hook\\", meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an \\"act of God\\", the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, and management of the ship. The basis of liability for the shipowner is a bailment and if the carrier is to be liable as a common carrier, it must be established that the goods were placed in the carrier's possession and control for immediate carriage.Robinson, Gustavus H. (1939). Handbook of Admiralty Law in the United States. Hornbook Series. St. Paul, Minnesota: West Publishing Co. p. 439 =Personal injuries to seamen= Seamen injured aboard ship have three possible sources of compensation: the principle of maintenance and cure, the doctrine of unseaworthiness, and the Jones Act. The principle of maintenance and cure requires a shipowner to both pay for an injured seaman's medical treatment until maximum medical recovery (MMR) is obtained and provide basic living expenses until completion of the voyage, even if the seaman is no longer aboard ship.

The village is on the east bank of the River Severn. The parish includes the village of Apperley and the hamlet of Deerhurst Walton. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 906, the majority of whom live in Apperley. The place-name is derived from Old English and means \\"deer-wood\\". It was spelt Deorhyrst in AD 804, Dorhirst in about 1050 and Derherste in the Domesday Book in 1086. Geography The parish has an area of about , bounded by the Severn to the west, the A38 road to the east and Coombe Hill Canal to the south. The parish is low-lying and much of it is repeatedly flooded. After serious flooding in 1947 several cottages were abandoned and demolished. Deerhurst was inundated again by the floods of 2007. Priory and parish church By AD 804 there was a Benedictine monastery at Deerhurst, which also held the manor. In about 1060 King Edward the Confessor divided the manor. He granted the monastery, with one hide of land, to the Abbey of St Denis in France, making it an alien priory. But the larger part of the land, assessed at five hides, he granted to Westminster Abbey. Deerhurst Priory ceased to be an alien house in 1443 and the Crown granted it to Tewkesbury Abbey in 1467. Both the abbey and the priory were dissolved in 1540. The priory church of St Mary, built in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries AD, survives as Deerhurst's Church of England parish church. It has been described as \\"an Anglo-Saxon monument of the first order\\" and is a Grade I listed building. Priory Farmhouse Part of another building of the priory survives in Priory Farmhouse, which adjoins the church. In its cellar is an 11th- or 12th-century column, but most of the core of the building seems to be 14th-century and later. After the dissolution in 1540 the building was converted into a farmhouse. It is a Grade I listed building. Odda's Chapel and Abbot's Court Odda's Chapel and Abbot's Court Odda of Deerhurst founded Odda's Chapel in 1056 as a chantry for his brother √Ülfric, who had died in 1053. Chantries were abolished in the 16th century and the chapel ceased to be used for worship. Early in the 17th century a timber-framed house, Abbot's Court, was built next to it as the manor house for the Westminster Abbey's estate. The former chapel was converted into the service wing of the house. The chapel is a Grade I listed building. Deerhurst Manor After dissolving the priory in 1540, the Crown leased its manor to a George Throckmorton. It remained with his heirs until 1604, when a Thomas Throckmorton sold it to Thomas Cassey of Wightfield Manor near Apperley. In 1615 the Cassey sold the manor to Thomas Coventry, who in 1628 was created Baron Coventry. In 1697 the 5th Baron Coventry was created Earl of Coventry and at the subsidiary title \\"Viscount Deerhurst\\" was created for his heir apparent. In 1964 trustees for the 11th Earl of Coventry still held an estate of at Deerhurst. The Coventry family has never lived at Deerhurst: its seat is at Croome Court in Worcestershire. School Former National School A National School was built in Deerhurst in 1856. Apperley had its own school until 1923, when it was closed and its pupils were transferred to Deerhurst. By 1964 it was a primary school, and children over the age of 11 attended secondary schools in Tewkesbury. The school has since moved to Apperley,Deerhurst and Apperley C of E Primary School and the building in Deerhurst has been converted into two private houses. Legend There is a local legend that a dragon once ravaged the area, until a man called John Smith killed it with an axe.

According to Homer she was the wife of Zethus, and the mother of Itylus.Homer, Odyssey xix. 517, &c.;  Mythology  Envious of Niobe, the wife of her husband's brother Amphion, who had six sons and six daughters, she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe's sons, but by mistake slew her own son Itylus. Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale, whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as A√´don's lamentations about her child. According to a later tradition preserved in Antoninus Liberalis,Antoninus Liberalis, c. 11 A√´don is instead the wife of Polytechnos, an artist of Colophon. The couple boasted that they loved each other more than Hera and Zeus. Hera sent Eris to cause trouble between the two of them. Polytechnus was then making a chair, and A√´don a piece of embroidery, and they agreed that whoever should finish the work first should receive from the other a female slave as the prize. Polytechnos was furious when A√´don (with Hera's help) won. He went to A√´don's father, and pretending that his wife wished to see her sister Chelidonis, he took her with him. On his way home he raped her, dressed her in slave's attire, commanded her to silence, and gave her to his wife as the promised prize. After some time Chelidonis, believing herself unobserved, lamented her own fate, but she was overheard by A√´don, and the two sisters conspired against Polytechnus for revenge. They murdered Polytechnos' son Itys and served him up as a meal to his father. A√´don then fled with Chelidonis to her father, who, when Polytechnos came in pursuit of his wife, had him bound, smeared with honey, and exposed to the insects. A√´don now took pity upon the sufferings of her husband, and when her relations were on the point of killing her for this weakness, Zeus changed Polytechnos into a pelican, the brother of A√´don into a whoop, her father into a sea-eagle, Chelidonis into a swallow, and A√´don herself into a nightingale.

After his premature death before his twentieth birthday, Antinous was deified on Hadrian‚Äôs orders, being worshipped in both the Greek East and Latin West, sometimes as a god (theos) and sometimes merely as a hero ().Renberg, Gil H.: Hadrian and the Oracles of Antinous (SHA, Hadr. 14.7); with an appendix on the so-called Antinoeion at Hadrian's Villa and Rome's Monte Pincio Obelisk, Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, Vol. 55 (2010) [2011], 159‚Äì198; Jones, Christopher P., New Heroes in Antiquity: From Achilles to Antinoos (Cambridge, Massachusetts & London, 2010), 75‚Äì83; Bendlin, Andreas: Associations, Funerals, Sociality, and Roman Law: The collegium of Diana and Antinous in Lanuvium (CIL 14.2112) Reconsidered, in M. √ñhler (ed.), Aposteldekret und antikes Vereinswesen: Gemeinschaft und ihre Ordnung (WUNT 280; T√ºbingen, 2011), 207‚Äì296. Little is known of Antinous's life, although it is known that he was born in Claudiopolis (present day Bolu, Turkey), in the Roman province of Bithynia et Pontus. He was probably introduced to Hadrian in 123, before being taken to Italy for a higher education. He had become the favourite of Hadrian by 128, when he was taken on a tour of the Roman Empire as part of Hadrian's personal retinue. Antinous accompanied Hadrian during his attendance of the annual Eleusinian Mysteries in Athens, and was with him when he killed the Marousian lion in Libya. In October 130, as they were part of a flotilla going along the Nile, Antinous died amid mysterious circumstances. Various suggestions have been put forward for how he died, ranging from an accidental drowning to an intentional human sacrifice or suicide. Following his death, Hadrian deified Antinous and founded an organised cult devoted to his worship that spread throughout the Empire. Hadrian founded the city of Antino√∂polis close to Antinous's place of death, which became a cultic centre for the worship of Osiris-Antinous. Hadrian also founded games in commemoration of Antinous to take place in both Antino√∂polis and Athens, with Antinous becoming a symbol of Hadrian's dreams of pan-Hellenism. The worship of Antinous proved to be one of the most enduring and popular of cults of deified humans in the Roman empire, and events continued to be founded in his honor long after Hadrian's death. Antinous became associated with homosexuality in Western culture, appearing in the work of Oscar Wilde and Fernando Pessoa. Biography The Classicist Caroline Vout noted that most of the texts dealing with Antinous's biography only dealt with him briefly and were post-Hadrianic in date, thus commenting that \\"reconstructing a detailed biography is impossible\\". The historian Thorsten Opper noted that \\"Hardly anything is known of Antinous's life, and the fact that our sources get more detailed the later they are does not inspire confidence.\\" Antinous's biographer Royston Lambert echoed this view, commenting that information on him was \\"tainted always by distance, sometimes by prejudice and by the alarming and bizarre ways in which the principal sources have been transmitted to us.\\" =Childhood= It is known that Antinous was born to a Greek family in the city of Claudiopolis, which was located in the Roman province of Bithynia in what is now north-west Turkey. The year of Antinous's birth is not recorded, although it is estimated that it was probably between 110 and 112 AD. Early sources record that his birthday was in November, and although the exact date is not known, Lambert asserted that it was probably on 27 November. Given the location of his birth and his physical appearance, it is likely that part of his ancestry was not Greek. There are various potential origins for the name \\"Antinous\\"; it is possible that he was named after the character of Antinous, who is one of Penelope's suitors in Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey. Another possibility is that he was given the male equivalent of Antino√´, a woman who was one of the founding figures of Mantineia, a city which probably had close relations with Bithynia. Although many historians from the Renaissance onward asserted that Antinous had been a slave, only one of around fifty early sources claims that, and it remains unlikely, as it would have proved heavily controversial to deify a former slave in Roman society. There is no surviving reliable evidence attesting to Antinous's family background, although Lambert believed it most likely that his family would have been peasant farmers or small business owners, thereby being socially undistinguished yet not from the poorest sectors of society. Lambert also considered it likely that Antinous would have had a basic education as a child, having been taught how to read and write. =Life with Hadrian= Hadrian (left) and Antinous (right), both part of the Townley Marbles The Emperor Hadrian spent much time during his reign touring his Empire, and arrived in Claudiopolis in June 123, which was probably when he first encountered Antinous. Given Hadrian's personality, Lambert thought it unlikely that they had become lovers at this point, instead suggesting it probable that Antinous had been selected to be sent to Italy, where he was probably schooled at the imperial paedagogium at the Caelian Hill. Hadrian meanwhile had continued to tour the Empire, only returning to Italy in September 125, when he settled into his villa at Tibur. It was at some point over the following three years that Antinous became his personal favourite, for by the time he left for Greece three years later, he brought Antinous with him in his personal retinue. Lambert described Antinous as \\"the one person who seems to have connected most profoundly with Hadrian\\" throughout the latter's life. Hadrian's marriage to Sabina was unhappy, and there is no reliable evidence that he ever expressed a sexual attraction for women, in contrast to much reliable early evidence that he was sexually attracted to boys and young men. For centuries, sexual relations between a man and a boy had been socially acceptable among Greece's leisured and citizen classes, with an older erastes (the \\"lover\\", aged between 20 and 40) undertaking a caring sexual relationship with an eromenos (the \\"beloved\\", aged between 12 and 18) and taking a key role in his (the latter's) education. Hadrian took Antinous as a favoured servant when they were aged about 48 and 13 respectively. Such a societal institution of pederasty was not indigenous to Roman culture, although bisexuality was widely socially accepted in the upper echelons of Roman society by the early 2nd century. It is known that Hadrian believed Antinous to be intelligent and wise, and that they had a shared love of hunting, which was seen as a particularly manly pursuit in Roman culture. Although none survive, it is known that Hadrian wrote both an autobiography and erotic poetry about his boy favourites; it is therefore likely that he wrote about Antinous. Early sources are explicit that the relationship between Hadrian and Antinous was sexual. During their relationship, there is no evidence that Antinous ever used his influence over Hadrian for personal or political gain. In March 127, Hadrian - probably accompanied by Antinous - travelled through the Sabine area of Italy, Picenum, and Campania. From 127 to 129 the Emperor was then afflicted with an illness that doctors were unable to explain. In April 128 he laid the foundation stone for a temple of Venus and Rome in the city of Rome, during a ritual where he may well have been accompanied by Antinous. From there, Hadrian went on a tour of North Africa, during which he was accompanied by Antinous. In late 128 Hadrian and Antinous landed in Corinth, proceeding to Athens, where they remained until May 129, accompanied by Sabina, the Caeserii brothers, and Pedanius Fuscus the Younger. It was in Athens in September 128 that they attended the annual celebrations of the Great Mysteries of Eleusis, where Hadrian was initiated into the position of epoptes in the Telesterion. It is generally agreed, although not proven, that Antinous was also initiated at that time. tondo depicting Hadrian's lion hunt, accompanied by Antinous From there they headed to Asia Minor, settling in Antioch in June 129, where they were based for a year, visiting Syria, Arabia, and Judaea. From there, Hadrian became increasingly critical of Jewish culture, which he feared opposed Romanisation, and so introduced policies banning circumcision and building a Temple of Zeus-Jupiter on the former site of the Jewish Temple. From there, they headed to Egypt. Arriving in Alexandria in August 130, there they visited the sarcophagus of Alexander the Great. Although welcomed with public praise and ceremony, some of Hadrian's appointments and actions angered the city's Hellenic social elite, who began to gossip about his sexual activities, including those with Antinous. Soon after, and probably in September 130, Hadrian and Antinous travelled west to Libya, where they had heard of a Marousian lion causing problems for local people. They hunted down the lion, and although the exact events are unclear, it is apparent that Hadrian saved Antinous's life during their confrontation with it, before the beast itself was killed. Hadrian widely publicised the event, casting bronze medallions of it, getting historians to write about it, commissioning Pancrates to write a poem about it, and having a tondo depicting it created which was later placed on the Arch of Constantine. On this tondo it was clear that Antinous was no longer a youth, having become more muscular and hairy, perceptibly more able to resist his master; and thus it is likely that his relationship with Hadrian was changing as a result. =Death= Statue of Antinous (Delphi), polychrome Parian marble, made during the reign of Hadrian (r. 117‚Äì138 AD) In late September or early October 130, Hadrian and his entourage, among them Antinous, assembled at Heliopolis to set sail upstream as part of a flotilla along the River Nile. The retinue included officials, the Prefect, army and naval commanders, as well as literary and scholarly figures. Possibly also joining them was Lucius Ceionius Commodus, a young aristocrat whom Antinous might have deemed a rival to Hadrian's affections. On their journey up the Nile, they stopped at Hermopolis Magna, the primary shrine to the god Thoth. It was shortly after this, in October 130 - around the time of the festival of Osiris - that Antinous fell into the river and died, probably from drowning. Hadrian publicly announced his death, with gossip soon spreading throughout the Empire that Antinous had been intentionally killed. The nature of Antinous's death remains a mystery to this day, and it is possible that Hadrian himself never knew; however, various hypotheses have been put forward. * One possibility is that he was murdered by a conspiracy at court. However, Lambert asserted that this was unlikely because it lacked any supporting historical evidence, and because Antinous himself seemingly exerted little influence over Hadrian, thus meaning that an assassination served little purpose. * Another suggestion is that Antinous had died during a voluntary castration as part of an attempt to retain his youth and thus his sexual appeal to Hadrian. However, this is improbable because Hadrian deemed both castration and circumcision to be abominations and as Antinous was aged between 18 and 20 at the time of death, any such operation would have been ineffective. * A third possibility is that the death was accidental, perhaps if Antinous was intoxicated. However, in the surviving evidence Hadrian does not describe the death as being an accident; Lambert thought that this was suspicious. * Another possibility is that Antinous represented a voluntary human sacrifice. The earliest surviving evidence for this comes from the writings of Dio Cassius, 80 years after the event, although it was subsequently repeated in many later sources. In the 2nd century Roman Empire, a belief that the death of one could rejuvenate the health of another was widespread, and Hadrian had been ill for many years; in this scenario, Antinous could have sacrificed himself in the belief that Hadrian would have recovered. If this last situation were true, Hadrian might not have revealed the cause of Antinous's death because he did not wish to appear either physically or politically weak. Conversely, opposing this possibility is the fact that Hadrian disliked human sacrifice and had strengthened laws against it in the Empire.  Deification and the cult of Antinous  Antinous remained in starcharts for centuries, only disappearing for good when the constellations were formalized by the International Astronomical Union in 1930. Hadrian was devastated by the death of Antinous, and possibly also experiencing remorse. In Egypt, the local priesthood immediately deified Antinous by identifying him with Osiris due to the manner of his death. In keeping with Egyptian custom, Antinous's body was probably embalmed and mummified by priests, a lengthy process which might explain why Hadrian remained in Egypt until spring 131. While there, in October 130 Hadrian proclaimed Antinous to be a deity and announced that a city should be built on the site of his death in commemoration of him, to be called Antino√∂polis. The deification of human beings was not uncommon in the Classical world. However, the public and formal divinisation of humans was reserved for the Emperor and members of the imperial family; thus Hadrian's decision to declare Antinous a god and create a formal cult devoted to him was highly unusual, and he did so without the permission of the Senate. Although the cult of Antinous therefore had connections with the imperial cult, it remained separate and distinct. Hadrian also identified a star in the sky between the Eagle and the Zodiac to be Antinous, and came to associate the rosy lotus that grew on the banks of the Nile as being the flower of Antinous. The Antinous Obelisk in the Pincio Hill of Rome It is unknown exactly where Antinous's body was buried. It has been argued that either his body or some relics associated with him would have been interred at a shrine in Antino√∂polis, although this has yet to be identified archaeologically. However, a surviving obelisk contains an inscription strongly suggesting that Antinous's body was interred at Hadrian's country estate, the Villa Adriana at Tibur in Italy. The remains of the Antinoeion at Hadrian's Villa It is unclear whether Hadrian genuinely believed that Antinous had become a god. He would have also had political motives for creating the organised cult, for it enshrined political and personal loyalties specifically to him. In October 131 he proceeded to Athens, where from 131/32 he founded the Panhellenion, an attempt to foster Greek self-consciousness, erode the feuding endemic to the Greek city-states, and promote the worship of the ancient gods; being Greek himself, the god Antinous helped Hadrian's cause in this, representing a symbol of pan-Hellenic unity. In Athens, Hadrian also established a festival to be held in honour of Antinous in October, the Antinoeia. Antinous was understood differently by his various worshippers, in part due to regional and cultural variation. In some inscriptions he is identified as a divine hero, in others as a god, and in others as both a divine hero and a god. Conversely, in many Egyptian inscriptions he is described as both a hero and a god, while in others he was seen as a full god, and in Egypt, he was often understood as a daemon. Inscriptions indicate that Antinous was seen primarily as a benevolent deity, who could be turned to aid his worshipers and cure them of ailments. He was also seen as a conqueror of death, with his name and image often being included in coffins. =Antino√∂polis= The city of Antino√∂polis was erected on the site of Hir-we. All previous buildings were razed and replaced, with the exception of the Temple of Ramses II. Hadrian also had political motives for the creation of Antino√∂polis, which was to be the first Hellenic city in the Middle Nile region, thus serving as a bastion of Greek culture within the Egyptian area. To encourage Egyptians to integrate with this imported Greek culture, he permitted Greeks and Egyptians in the city to marry and allowed the main deity of Hir-we, Bes, to continue to be worshipped in Antino√∂polis alongside the new primary deity, Osiris-Antinous. He encouraged Greeks from elsewhere to settle in the new city, using various incentives to do so. The city was designed on a Hippodamian grid that was typical of Hellenic cities, and embellished with columns and many statues of Antinous, as well as a temple devoted to the deity. The site of Antino√∂polis in Egypt Hadrian proclaimed that games would be held at the city in Spring 131 in commemoration of Antinous. Known as the Antinoeia, they would be held annually for several centuries, being noted as the most important in Egypt. Events included athletic competitions, chariot and equestrian races, and artistic and musical festivals, with prizes including citizenship, money, tokens, and free lifetime maintenance. Antino√∂polis continued to grow into the Byzantine era, being Christianised with the conversion of the Empire, however it retained an association with magic for centuries to come. Over the centuries, stone from the Hadrianic city was removed for the construction of homes and mosques. By the 18th century, the ruins of Antino√∂polis were still visible, being recorded by such European travellers as Jesuit missionary Claude Sicard in 1715 and Edme-Fran√ßois Jomard the surveyor circa 1800. However, in the 19th century, Antino√∂polis was almost completely destroyed by local industrial production, as the chalk and limestone was burned for powder while stone was used in the construction of a nearby dam and sugar factory. =The cult's spread= \\"Lansdowne Antinous\\" was found at Hadrian's Villa in 1769 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) Hadrian was keen to disseminate the cult of Antinous throughout the Roman Empire. He focused on its spread within the Greek lands, and in Summer 131 travelled these areas promoting it by presenting Antinous in a syncretised form with the more familiar deity Hermes. On a visit to Trapezus in 131, he proclaimed the foundation of a temple devoted to Hermes, where the deity was probably venerated as Hermes-Antinous. Although Hadrian preferred to associate Antinous with Hermes, he was far more widely syncretised with the god Dionysus across the Empire. The cult also spread through Egypt, and within a few years of its foundation, altars and temples to the god had been erected in Hermopolis, Alexandria, Oxyrhynchus, Tebytnis, Lykopolis, and Luxor. The cult of Antinous was never as large as those of well established deities such as Zeus, Dionysus, Demeter, or Asclepios, or even as large as those of cults which were growing in popularity at that time, such as Isis or Serapis, and was also smaller than the official imperial cult of Hadrian himself. However, it spread rapidly throughout the Empire, with traces of the cult having been found in at least 70 cities. The cult was most popular in Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, and the North African coast, but a large community of worshippers also existed in Italy, Spain, and northwestern Europe. Artifacts in honor of Antinous have been found in an area that spans from Britain to the Danube. Although the adoption of the Antinous cult was in some cases done to please Hadrian, the evidence makes it clear that the cult was also genuinely popular among the different societal classes in the Empire, and archaeological finds point that Antinous was worshipped in both public and private settings. In Egypt, Athens, Macedonia, and Italy, children would be named after the deity. Part of the appeal was that Antinous had once been human himself, and thus was more relatable than many other deities. It is also possible, however, that his cult borrowed power from parallels between Antinous and beautiful young male immortals in the Greco-Roman pantheon like Apollo, Dionysus, and Silvanus as well as mortal youths beloved by gods in classical mythology like Ganymede, Hylas, Hyacinth, and Narcissus, and that images of the sensuous youth invited imaginary erotic bonding between him and his worshipers. These characteristics were common also to the cults of Attis, Endymion, and Adonis. Like the latter, Antinous was treated as a dying-and-rising god not only in Egypt, but in Rome and Greece; the Obelisk of Antinous in Rome describes the honorand, \\"Osirantinous\\" as \\"the Reborn\\" and \\"the Everlasting\\". Antinous (Museo Pio- Clementino) At least 28 temples were constructed for the worship of Antinous throughout the Empire, although most were fairly modest in design; those at Tarsos, Philadelphia, and Lanuvium consisted of a four-column portico. It is likely however that those which Hadrian was directly involved in, such as at Antino√∂polis, Bithynion, and Mantineria, were often grander, while in the majority of cases, shrines or altars to Antinous would have been erected in or near the pre-existing temples of the imperial cult, or Dionysus or Hermes. Worshippers would have given votive offerings to the deity at these altars; there is evidence that he was given gifts of food and drink in Egypt, with libations and sacrifices probably being common in Greece. Priests devoted to Antinous would have overseen this worship, with the names of some of these individuals having survived in inscriptions. There is evidence of oracles being present at a number of Antinoan temples. Sculptures of Antinous became widespread, with Hadrian probably having approved a basic model of Antinous's likeness for other sculptors to follow. These sculptures were produced in large quantities between 130 and 138, with estimates being in the region of around 2000, of which at least 115 survive. 44 have been found in Italy, half of which were at Hadrian's Villa Adriana, while 12 have been found in Greece and Asia Minor, and 6 in Egypt. Over 31 cities in the Empire, the majority in Greece and Asia Minor, issued coins depicting Antinous, chiefly between the years 134-35\\\\. Many were designed to be used as medallions rather than currency, some of them deliberately made with a hole so that they could be hung from the neck and used as talismans. Most production of Antinous-based artefacts ceased following the 130s, although such items continued to be used by the cult's followers for several centuries. Later survivals of his cult largely rested in the Eastern Roman Empire, where his acceptance into the pantheon of gods was better received. Games held in honour of Antinous were held in at least 9 cities, and included both athletic and artistic components. The games at Bythynion, Antino√∂polis, and Mantineia were still active by the early 3rd century, while those at Athens and Eleusis were still operating in 266-67\\\\. Rumours spread throughout the Empire that at Antinous's cultic centre in Antino√∂polis, there were \\"sacred nights\\" characterised by drunken revelries, perhaps including sexual orgies. =Condemnation and decline= The cult of Antinous was criticised by various individuals, both pagan and Christian. Critics included followers of other pagan cults, such as Pausanias,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.9.7 and 8.9.8 Lucian, and the Emperor Julian, who were all sceptical about the apotheosis of Antinous, as well as the Sibylline Oracles, who were critical of Hadrian more generally. The pagan philosopher Celsus also criticised it for what he perceived as the debauched nature of its Egyptian devotees, arguing that it led people into immoral behaviour, in this way comparing it to Christianity. Surviving examples of Christian condemnation of the Antinous cults come from figures like Tertullian, Origen, Jerome, and Epiphanios. Viewing the religion as a blasphemous rival to Christianity, they insisted that Antinous had simply been a mortal human and condemned his sexual activities with Hadrian as immoral. Associating his cult with malevolent magic, they argued that Hadrian had imposed his worship through fear. During the struggles between Christians and pagans in Rome during the 4th century, Antinous was championed by members of the latter. As a result of this, the Christian poet Prudentius denounced his worship in 384, while a set of seven contorniates depicting Antinous were issued, based upon the designs of those issued in the 130s. Many sculptures of Antinous were destroyed by Christians, as well as by invading barbarian tribes, although in some instances were then re-erected; the Antinous statue at Delphi had been toppled and had its forearms broken off, before being re- erected in a chapel elsewhere. Many of the images of Antinous remained in public places until the official prohibition of pagan religions under the reign of Emperor Theodosius in 391.  In Roman sculpture  Hadrian \\"turned to Greek sculptors to perpetuate the melancholy beauty, diffident manner, and lithe and sensuous frame of his boyfriend Antinous,\\" creating in the process what has been described as \\"the last independent creation of Greco-Roman art\\". It is traditionally assumed that they were all produced between Antinous's death in 130 and that of Hadrian in 138, on the questionable grounds that no- one else would be interested in commissioning them. The assumption is that official models were sent out to provincial workshops all over the empire to be copied, with local variations permitted. It has been asserted that many of these sculptures \\"share distinctive features - a broad, swelling chest, a head of tousled curls, a downcast gaze - that allow them to be instantly recognized\\". About a hundred statues of Antinous have been preserved for modernity, at the least, a remarkable fact as his cult was the target of intense hostility by apologists of Christianity, whose followers vandalized and destroyed artifacts and temples built in honor of the youth. By 2005, classicist Caroline Vout could note that more images have been identified of Antinous than of any other figure in classical antiquity with the exceptions of Augustus and Hadrian. She also asserted that the Classical study of these Antinous images was particularly important because of his \\"rare mix\\" of \\"biographical mystery and overwhelming physical presence\\". Lambert believed that the sculptures of Antinous \\"remain without doubt one of the most elevated and ideal monuments to pederastic love of the whole ancient world\\", also describing them as \\"the final great creation of classical art\\". There are also statues in many archaeological museums in Greece including the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, the archaeological museums of Patras, Chalkis and Delphi. Although these may well be idealised images, they demonstrate what all contemporary writers described as Antinous's extraordinary beauty. Although many of the sculptures are instantly recognizable, some offer significant variation in terms of the suppleness and sensuality of the pose and features versus the rigidity and typical masculinity. In 1998 monumental remains were discovered at Hadrian's Villa that archaeologists claimed were from the tomb of Antinous, or a temple to him,Mari, Zaccaria and Sgalambro, Sergio: \\"The Antinoeion of Hadrian's Villa: Interpretation and Architectural Reconstruction\\", American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 111, No. 1, January 2007, though this has been challenged both because of the inconclusive nature of the archaeological remains and the overlooking of patristic sources (Epiphanius, Clement of Alexandria) indicating that Antinous was buried at his temple in Antino√∂polis, the Egyptian city founded in his honour.Renberg, pp. 181‚Äì191.

Sculptures of Antinous began to be reproduced from the 16th century; it remains likely that some of these modern examples have subsequently been sold as Classical artefacts and are still viewed as such. Antinous has attracted attention from the homosexual subculture since the 18th century, the most illustrious examples for this being Prince Eugene of Savoy and Frederick the Great of Prussia. Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as \\"a gay icon\\". Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being \\"at the forefront of the homosexual imagination\\" in late 19th-century Europe. In this, Antinous replaced the figure of Ganymede, who had been the primary homoerotic representation in the visual arts during the Renaissance. Gay author Karl Heinrich Ulrichs celebrated Antinous in an 1865 pamphlet that he wrote under the pseudonym of \\"Numa Numantius\\". In 1893, homophile newspaper The Artist, began offering cast statues of Antinous for ¬£3 10s. At the time, Antinous's fame was increased by the work of fiction and writers and scholars, many of whom were not homosexuals. The author Oscar Wilde referenced Antinous in both \\"The Young King\\" (1891) and \\"The Sphinx\\" (1894). In \\"The Young King\\", a reference is made to the king kissing a statue of 'the Bithynian slave of Hadrian' in a passage describing the young king's aesthetic sensibilities and his \\"...strange passion for beauty...\\". Images of other classical paragons of male beauty, Adonis and Endymion, are also mentioned in the same context. Additionally, in Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, the artist Basil Hallward describes the appearance of Dorian Gray as an event as important to his art as \\"the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture.\\" Furthermore, in a novel attributed to Oscar Wilde, Teleny, or The Reverse of the Medal, Des Grieux makes a passing reference to Antinous as he describes how he felt during a musical performance. \\"I now began to understand things hitherto so strange, the love the mighty monarch felt for his fair Grecian slave, Antinous, who ‚Äì like unto Christ ‚Äì died for his master's sake.\\"Teleny, or the Reverse of the Medals, vol. 1 p.14 In Les Mis√©rables, the character Enjolras is likened to Antinous. \\"A charming young man who was capable of being a terror. He was angelically good-looking, an untamed Antinous.\\" Hugo also remarks that Enjolras was \\"seeming not to be aware of the existence on earth of a creature called woman.\\" In \\"Klage um Antinous\\", Der neuen Gedichte, Anderer Teil (1908) by Rainer Maria Rilke, Hadrian scolds the gods for Antinous's deification. \\"Lament for Antino√ºs\\", translation by Stephen Cohn. In 1915 Fernando Pessoa wrote a long poem entitled Antinous, but he only published it in 1918, close to the end of World War I, in a slim volume of English verse. In 1921 he published a new version of this poem in English Poems, a book published by his own publishing house, Olisipo. In Marguerite Yourcenar's M√©moires d'Hadrien (1951), the love relationship between Antinous and Hadrian is one of the main themes of the book. A \\"sexually ambivalent\\" young man ('Murugan Mailendra') in Aldous Huxley's Island (1962) is likened to Antinous, and his lover Colonel Dipa (an older man) to Hadrian, after the narrator discovers the two are having a secret affair. The story of Antinous' death was dramatized in the radio play \\"The Glass Ball Game\\", Episode Two of the second series of the BBC radio drama Caesar!, written by Mike Walker, directed by Jeremy Mortimer and starring Jonathan Coy as \\"Suetonius\\", Jonathan Hyde as \\"Hadrian\\" and Andrew Garfield as \\"Antinous\\". In this story, Suetonius is a witness to the events before and after Antinous's death by suicide, but learns that he himself was used as an instrument to trick Antinous into killing himself willingly to fulfill a pact made by Hadrian with Egyptian priests to give Hadrian more time to live so that Marcus Aurelius may grow up to become the next Emperor. Antinous is seen walking with the other gods to war in Neil Gaiman's novel American Gods. In Tipping the Velvet (novel by Sarah Waters and its television adaptation), the lesbian protagonist Nan Astley dresses as Antinous for a costume party held by her partner. On 13 October 2018, in Toronto, the Canadian Opera Company premiered Hadrian, the second opera by Rufus Wainwright, which tells the tale of the Emperor's grief and his all-consuming need to discover the details surrounding Antinous's death. In March 2020, the Hadrian Cup (a rugby tournament for LGBT-inclusive teams based in Newcastle, a city founded by Hadrian himself) introduced the Antinous Plate in honour of Hadrian's lover, which was awarded to Aberdeen Taexali Rugby Club.

He was the twin brother of Helle and the father of Argus, Phrontis, Melas and Cytisorus by Chalciope, daughter of Aeetes, king of Colchis.  Mythology  Phrixus and Helle were hated by their stepmother, Ino. She hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all of Boeotia's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus and Helle. Before they were killed, though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying, or swimming,Flying is conventional in modern treatments, but see D. S.

During their flight Helle swooned, fell off the ram and drowned in the strait between Europe and Asia, which was named after her the Hellespont, meaning the sea of Helle (now Dardanelles); Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Ae√´tes, the son of the sun god Helios, took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Zeus and gave the king the Golden Fleece of the ram, which Ae√´tes hung in a tree in the holy grove of Ares in his kingdom, guarded by a dragon that never slept. Phrixus and Chalciope had four sons, who later joined forces with the Argonauts. The oldest was Argos/ Argus, Phrontis, Melas, and Cytisorus.

He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period. He began to paint in a precise tenebrist style, later developing a freer manner characterized by bold brushwork. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family and commoners, culminating in his masterpiece Las Meninas (1656). Vel√°zquez's artwork became a model for 19th century realist and impressionist painters. In the 20th century, artists such as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dal√≠ and Francis Bacon paid tribute to Vel√°zquez by re-interpreting some of his most iconic images. Early life Birthplace of Vel√°zquez in Seville Vel√°zquez was born in Seville, Spain, the first child of Juan Rodriguez de Silva, a notary, and Jer√≥nima Vel√°zquez. He was baptized at the church of St. Peter in Seville on Sunday, June 6, 1599.Carr et al. 2006, p. 26. The baptism most likely occurred a few days or weeks after his birth. His paternal grandparents, Diogo da Silva and Maria Rodrigues, were Portuguese and had moved to Seville decades earlier. When Vel√°zquez was offered knighthood in 1658 he claimed descent from the lesser nobility in order to qualify; in fact, however, his grandparents were tradespeople, and possibly Jewish conversos.Newitt, Malyn (2009). Portugal in European and World History. London: Reaktion Books. p. 98. .Ingram, Kevin (1999). \\"Diego Vel√°zquez's Secret History\\", Bolet√≠n del Museo del Prado, XVII (35): 69‚Äì85. As was customary in Andalusia, Vel√°zquez usually used his mother's surname.Harris 1982, p. 9. Raised in modest circumstances, he showed an early gift for art, and was apprenticed to Francisco Pacheco, an artist and teacher in Seville. An early-18th-century biographer, Antonio Palomino, said Vel√°zquez studied for a short time under Francisco de Herrera before beginning his apprenticeship under Pacheco, but this is undocumented. A contract signed on September 17, 1611, formalized a six-year apprenticeship with Pacheco backdated to December 1610,Carr et al. 2006, p. 53. and it has been suggested that Herrera may have substituted for a traveling Pacheco between December 1610 and September 1611. Though considered a dull and undistinguished painter, Pacheco sometimes expressed a simple, direct realism although his work remained essentially Mannerist.Carr et al. 2006, p. 28. As a teacher, he was highly learned and encouraged his students' intellectual development. In Pacheco's school Vel√°zquez studied the classics, was trained in proportion and perspective, and witnessed the trends in the literary and artistic circles of Seville.Carr et al. 2006, p. 14. Old Woman Frying Eggs). National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh On April 23, 1618, Vel√°zquez married Juana Pacheco (June 1, 1602August 10, 1660), the daughter of his teacher. She had two daughters. The elder, Francisca de Silva Vel√°zquez y Pacheco (1619‚Äì1658), married painter Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo at the Church of Santiago in Madrid on August 21, 1633; the younger, Ignacia de Silva Vel√°zquez y Pacheco, born in 1621, died in infancy. Vel√°zquez's earliest works are bodegones (kitchen scenes with prominent still-life). He was one of the first Spanish artists to paint such scenes, and his Old Woman Frying Eggs (1618) demonstrates the young artist's unusual skill in realistic depiction.Carr et al. 2006, p. 27. The realism and dramatic lighting of this work may have been influenced by Caravaggio's work‚Äîwhich Vel√°zquez could have seen second-hand, in copies‚Äîand by the polychrome sculpture in Sevillian churches.Carr et al. 2006, p. 29. Two of his bodegones, Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha (1618) and Kitchen Scene with Christ at Emmaus (c. 1618), feature religious scenes in the background, painted in a way that creates ambiguity as to whether the religious scene is a painting on the wall, a representation of the thoughts of the kitchen maid in the foreground, or an actual incident seen through a window.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 122, 126. The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (1618‚Äì19) follows a formula used by Pacheco, but replaces the idealized facial type and smoothly finished surfaces of his teacher with the face of a local girl and varied brushwork.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 28, 29. His other religious works include The Adoration of the Magi (1619) and Saint John the Evangelist on the Island of Patmos (1618‚Äì19), both of which begin to express his more pointed and careful realism. Also from this period are the portrait of Sor Jer√≥nima de la Fuente (1620) ‚Äì Vel√°zquez's first full-length portraitCarr et al. 2006, p. 142. ‚Äì and the genre The Water Seller of Seville (1618‚Äì1622). The Water Seller of Seville has been termed \\"the peak of Vel√°zquez's bodegones\\" and is admired for its virtuoso rendering of volumes and textures as well as for its enigmatic gravitas.Carr et al. 2006, p. 130. To Madrid (early period) Philip IV in Brown and Silver, 1632 Vel√°zquez had established his reputation in Seville by the early 1620s. He traveled to Madrid in April 1622, with letters of introduction to Don Juan de Fonseca, chaplain to the King. Vel√°zquez was not allowed to paint the new king, Philip IV, but portrayed the poet Luis de G√≥ngora at the request of Pacheco.Carr et al. 2006, p. 245. The portrait showed G√≥ngora crowned with a laurel wreath, which Vel√°zquez later painted over.Carr et al. 2006, p. 144. He returned to Seville in January 1623 and remained there until August.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 29, 245. In December 1622, Rodrigo de Villandrando, the king's favorite court painter, died.Harris 1982, p. 57. Vel√°zquez received a command to come to the court from Gaspar de Guzm√°n, Count-Duke of Olivares, the powerful minister of Philip IV. He was offered 50 ducats (175 g of gold) to defray his expenses, and he was accompanied by his father-in-law. Fonseca lodged the young painter in his home and sat for a portrait, which, when completed, was conveyed to the royal palace. A portrait of the king was commissioned, and on August 30, 1623, Philip IV sat for Vel√°zquez. The portrait pleased the king, and Olivares commanded Vel√°zquez to move to Madrid, promising that no other painter would ever paint Philip's portrait and all other portraits of the king would be withdrawn from circulation.Harris 1982, pp. 12, 200. In the following year, 1624, he received 300 ducats from the king to pay the cost of moving his family to Madrid, which became his home for the remainder of his life. El Triunfo de Baco or Los Borrachos 1629 (English: The Triumph of Bacchus/The Drunks) Maria Theresa, Philip IV's daughter with Elisabeth of France Vel√°zquez secured admission to the royal service with a salary of 20 ducats per month, lodgings and payment for the pictures he might paint. His portrait of Philip was exhibited on the steps of San Felipe and received with enthusiasm. It is now lost (as is the portrait of Fonseca).Harris 1982, p. 12. The Museo del Prado, however, has two of Vel√°zquez's portraits of the king (nos. 1070 and 1071) in which the severity of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate. The modeling is firm, recalling that of Antonio Mor, the Dutch portrait painter of Philip II, who exercised a considerable influence on the Spanish school. Vel√°zquez depicts Philip wearing the golilla, a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the neck. The golilla replaced the earlier court fashion of elaborate ruffed collars as part of Philip's dress reform laws during a period of economic crisis.Harris 1982, p. 61. The Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles I) arrived at the court of Spain in 1623. Records indicate that he sat for Vel√°zquez, but the picture is now lost. In 1627, Philip set a competition for the best painters of Spain with the subject to be the expulsion of the Moors. Vel√°zquez won. Recorded descriptions of his painting (destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734)Carr et al. 2006, p. 31. say it depicted Philip III pointing with his baton to a crowd of men and women being led away by soldiers, while the female personification of Spain sits in calm repose. Vel√°zquez was appointed gentleman usher as reward. Later he also received a daily allowance of 12 r√©is, the same amount allotted to the court barbers, and 90 ducats a year for dress. In September 1628, Peter Paul Rubens was positioned in Madrid as an emissary from the Infanta Isabella, and Vel√°zquez accompanied him to view the Titians at the Escorial. Rubens, who demonstrated his brilliance as painter and courtier during the seven months of the diplomatic mission, had a high opinion of Vel√°zquez but had no significant influence on his painting. He did, however, galvanize Vel√°zquez's desire to see Italy and the works of the great Italian masters.Ortega y Gasset 1953, p. 37. In 1629, Vel√°zquez received 100 ducats for the picture of Bacchus (The Triumph of Bacchus), also called Los Borrachos (The Drunks), a painting of a group of men in contemporary dress paying homage to a half-naked ivy-crowned young man seated on a wine barrel. Vel√°zquez's first mythological painting,Carr et al. 2006, p. 32. it has been interpreted variously as a depiction of a theatrical performance, as a parody, or as a symbolic representation of peasants asking the god of wine to give them relief from their sorrows.Harris 1982, p. 74. The style shows the naturalism of Vel√°zquez's early works slightly touched by the influence of Titian and Rubens.Harris 1982, p. 73. Italian period In 1629, Vel√°zquez was given permission to spend a year and a half in Italy. Though this first visit is recognized as a crucial chapter in the development of his style‚Äîand in the history of Spanish Royal Patronage, since Philip IV sponsored his trip‚Äîfew details and specifics are known of what the painter saw, whom he met, how he was perceived and what innovations he hoped to introduce into his painting. He traveled to Venice, Ferrara, Cento, Loreto, Bologna, and Rome. In 1630 he visited Naples to paint the portrait of Maria Anna of Spain, and there he probably met Ribera. The major works from his first Italian period are Joseph's Bloody Coat brought to Jacob (1629‚Äì30) and Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan (1630), both of which reveal his ambition to rival the Italians as a history painter in the grand manner.Carr et al. 2006, p. 33. The two compositions of several nearly life-sized figures have similar dimensions, and may have been conceived as pendants‚Äîthe biblical scene depicting a deception, and the mythological scene depicting the revelation of a deception.Carr et al. 2006, p. 157. As he had done in The Triumph of Bacchus, Vel√°zquez presented his characters as contemporary people whose gestures and facial expressions were those of everyday life.Carr et al. 2006, p. 147. Following the example of Bolognese painters such as Guido Reni, Vel√°zquez painted Apollo in the Forge of Vulcan on canvas prepared with a light gray ground rather than the dark reddish ground of all his earlier works. The change resulted in a greater luminosity than he had previously achieved, and he made the use of light-gray grounds his regular practice. =Return to Madrid (middle period)= La rendici√≥n de Breda (1634‚Äì1635) was inspired by Vel√°zquez's first visit to Italy, in which he accompanied Ambrogio Spinola, who conquered the Dutch city of Breda a few years prior. It depicts a transfer of the key to the city from the Dutch to the Spanish army during the Siege of Breda. It is considered one of the best of Vel√°zquez's paintings. Vel√°zquez returned to Madrid in January 1631. That year he completed the first of his many portraits of the young prince, beginning with Prince Balthasar Charles with a Dwarf (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts).Asturias and Bardi 1969, p. 93. ln portraits such as Equestrian portrait of prince Balthasar Charles (1635), Vel√°zquez depicts the prince looking dignified and lordly, or in the dress of a field marshal on his prancing steed. In one version, the scene is in the riding school of the palace, the king and queen looking on from a balcony, while Olivares attends as master of the horse to the prince.Carr et al. 2006, p. 182. To decorate the king's new palace, the Palacio del Buen Retiro, Vel√°zquez painted equestrian portraits of the royal family. In Philip IV on Horseback (1634‚Äì35), the king is represented in profile in an image of imperturbable majesty, demonstrating expert horsemanship by executing an effortless levade. The large The Surrender of Breda (1634‚Äì35), also painted for the Palacio, is Vel√°zquez's only extant painting depicting contemporary history.Carr et al. 2006, p. 38. Its symbolic treatment of a Spanish military victory over the Dutch eschews the rhetoric of conquest and superiority that is typical in such scenes, in which a general on horseback looks down on his vanquished, kneeling opponent. Instead, Vel√°zquez shows the Spanish general standing before his Dutch counterpart as an equal, and extending to him a hand of consolation.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 38‚Äì41. The impassive, saturnine face of the influential minister Olivares is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by Vel√°zquez. Two are notable: one is full- length, stately and dignified, in which he wears the green cross of the order of Alcantara and holds a wand, the badge of his office as master of the horse; in the other, The Count-Duke of Olivares on Horseback (c. 1635), he is flatteringly represented as a field marshal during action. In these portraits, Vel√°zquez well repaid the debt of gratitude that he owed to the patron who had first brought him to the king's attention.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 164, 180. The sculptor Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s modeled a statue on one of Vel√°zquez's equestrian portraits of the king (painted in 1636; now lost) which was cast in bronze by the Florentine sculptor Pietro Tacca and now stands in the Plaza de Oriente in Madrid. Vel√°zquez was in close attendance to Philip, and accompanied him to Aragon in 1644, where the artist painted a portrait of the monarch in the costume as he reviewed his troops in Fraga.Carr et al. 2006, p. 20. Vel√°zquez's paintings of Aesop and Menippus (both c. 1636‚Äì1638) portray ancient writers in the guise of portraits of beggars. Mars Resting (c. 1638) is both a depiction of a mythological figure and a portrait of a weary- looking, middle-aged man posing as Mars.Port√∫s 2004, p. 25. The model is painted with attention to his individuality, while his unkempt, oversized mustache is a faintly comic incongruity.Carr et al. 2006, p. 212. The equivocal image has been interpreted in various ways: Javier Port√∫s describes it as a \\"reflection on reality, representation, and the artistic vision\\", while Alfonso E. P√©rez S√°nchez says it \\"has also been seen as a melancholy meditation on the arms of Spain in decline\\". Had it not been for his royal appointment, which enabled Vel√°zquez to escape the censorship of the Inquisition, he would not have been able to release his La Venus del espejo (c. 1644‚Äì1648, English: Venus at her Mirror) also known as The Rokeby Venus. It is the first known female nude painted by a Spanish artist,S√°nchez, Alfonso E. P√©rez (January 1, 2003). \\"Vel√°zquez, Diego\\". Grove Art Online. and the only surviving female nude by Vel√°zquez. Portraiture Lady from court, c. 1635 Portrait of Pablo de Valladolid, 1635, a court fool of Philip IV Besides the many portraits of Philip by Vel√°zquez‚Äîthirty-four by one countOrtega y Gasset 1953, p. 45.‚Äîhe painted portraits of other members of the royal family: Philip's first wife, Elisabeth of Bourbon, and her children, especially her eldest son, Don Baltasar Carlos, whom Vel√°zquez first depicted at about two years of age. Cavaliers, soldiers, churchmen, and the poet Francisco de Quevedo (now at Apsley House), sat for Vel√°zquez. Vel√°zquez also painted several buffoons and dwarfs in Philip's court, whom he depicted sympathetically and with respect for their individuality, as in The Jester Don Diego de Acedo (1644), whose intelligent face and huge folio with ink-bottle and pen by his side show him to be a wise and well-educated man.Carr et al. 2006, p. 42. Pablo de Valladolid (1635), a buffoon evidently acting a part, and The Buffoon of Coria (1639) belong to this middle period. As court painter, Vel√°zquez had fewer commissions for religious works than any of his contemporaries. Christ Crucified (1632), painted for the Convent of San Pl√°cido in Madrid, depicts Christ immediately after death. The Savior's head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals part of the face, visually reinforcing the idea of death.Carr et al. 2006, p. 36. The figure is presented alone before a dark background. Vel√°zquez's son-in-law Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo had succeeded him as usher in 1634,Asturias and Bardi 1969, p. 84. and Mazo himself had received a steady promotion in the royal household. Mazo received a pension of 500 ducats in 1640, increased to 700 in 1648, for portraits painted and to be painted, and was appointed inspector of works in the palace in 1647. Philip now entrusted Vel√°zquez with the mission of procuring paintings and sculpture for the royal collection. Rich in pictures, Spain was weak in statuary, and Vel√°zquez was commissioned once again to proceed to Italy to make purchases.Harris 1982, pp. 24‚Äì25. =Second visit to Italy= Portrait of Pope Innocent X, 1650 When he set out in 1649, he was accompanied by his assistant Juan de Pareja who at this point in time was a slave and who had been trained in painting by Vel√°zquez.Harris 1982, pp. 25, 27, 87. Vel√°zquez sailed from M√°laga, landed at Genoa, and proceeded from Milan to Venice, buying paintings of Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese as he went.Harris 1982, pp. 25, 28. At Modena he was received with much favor by the duke, and here he painted the portrait of the duke at the Modena gallery and two portraits that now adorn the Dresden gallery, for these paintings came from the Modena sale of 1746. Those works presage the advent of the painter's third and latest manner, a noble example of which is the great portrait of Pope Innocent X in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome, where Vel√°zquez now proceeded. There he was received with marked favor by the Pope, who presented him with a medal and golden chain. Vel√°zquez took a copy of the portrait‚Äîwhich Sir Joshua Reynolds thought was the finest picture in Rome‚Äîwith him to Spain. Several copies of it exist in different galleries, some of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip. Vel√°zquez, in this work, had now reached the manera abreviada, a term coined by contemporary Spaniards for this bolder, sharper style. The portrait shows such ruthlessness in Innocent's expression that some in the Vatican feared that it would be seen unfavorably by the Pope; in fact Innocent was pleased with the work, and hung it in his official visitor's waiting room. Portrait of Juan de Pareja (c. 1650) In 1650 in Rome Vel√°zquez also painted a portrait of Juan de Pareja, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, USA. This portrait procured his election into the Accademia di San Luca. Purportedly Vel√°zquez created this portrait as a warm-up of his skills before his portrait of the Pope. It captures in great detail Pareja's countenance and his somewhat worn and patched clothing with an economic use of brushwork. In November 1650, Juan de Pareja was freed by Vel√°zquez.The manumission document was discovered by Jennifer Montagu. See Burlington Magazine, volume 125, 1983, pp. 683‚Äì4. To this period also belong two small landscape paintings both titled View of the Garden of the Villa Medici. As landscapes apparently painted directly from nature, they were exceptional for their time, and reveal Vel√°zquez's close study of light at different times of day.Harris 1982, pp. 141‚Äì143; Ortega y Gasset 1953, p. 38. As part of his mission to procure decorations for the Room of Mirrors at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, Vel√°zquez commissioned Matteo Bonuccelli to cast twelve bronze copies of the Medici lions. The copies are now in the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Museo del Prado. During his time in Rome, Vel√°zquez fathered a natural son, Antonio, whom he is not known ever to have seen.Carr et al. 2006, p. 247. Return to Spain and later career From February 1650, Philip repeatedly sought Vel√°zquez's return to Spain. Accordingly, after visiting Naples‚Äîwhere he saw his old friend Jose Ribera‚Äîand Venice, Vel√°zquez returned to Spain via Barcelona in 1651, taking with him many pictures and 300 pieces of statuary, which afterwards were arranged and catalogued for the king. Elisabeth of France had died in 1644, and the king had married Mariana of Austria, whom Vel√°zquez now painted in many attitudes. In 1652 he was specially chosen by the king to fill the high office of aposentador mayor, which imposed on him the duty of looking after the quarters occupied by the court‚Äîa responsible function which was no sinecure and one which interfered with the exercise of his art.Carr et al. 2006, p. 46. Yet far from indicating any decline, his works of this period are amongst the highest examples of his style.Carr et al. 2006, p. 47. =Las Meninas= Las Meninas (1656) One of the infantas, Margaret Theresa, the eldest daughter of the new Queen, appears to be the subject of Las Meninas (1656, English: The Maids of Honour), Vel√°zquez's magnum opus. Created four years before his death, it serves as an outstanding example of European baroque art. Luca Giordano, a contemporary Italian painter, referred to it as the \\"theology of painting\\",Asturias and Bardi 1969, p. 106. and in the eighteenth century the Englishman Thomas Lawrence cited it as the \\"philosophy of art\\". However, it is unclear as to who or what is the true subject of the picture.Carr et al. 2006, p. 48. Is it the royal daughter, or perhaps the painter himself? The king and queen are seen reflected in a mirror on the back wall, but the source of the reflection is a mystery: are the royal pair standing in the viewer's space, or does the mirror reflect the painting on which Vel√°zquez is working? Dale Brown says Vel√°zquez may have conceived the faded image of the king and queen on the back wall as a foreshadowing of the fall of the Spanish Empire that was to gain momentum following Philip's death. In the 1966 book Les Mots et Les Choses (The Order of Things), philosopher Michel Foucault devotes the opening chapter to a detailed analysis of Las Meninas. He describes the ways in which the painting problematizes issues of representation through its use of mirrors, screens, and the subsequent oscillations that occur between the image's interior, surface, and exterior. It is said the king painted the honorary Cross of Saint James of the Order of Santiago on the breast of the painter as it appears today on the canvas. However, Vel√°zquez did not receive this honor of knighthood until three years after execution of this painting. Even the King of Spain could not make his favorite a belted knight without the consent of the commission established to inquire into the purity of his lineage. The aim of these inquiries would be to prevent the appointment to positions of anyone found to have even a taint of heresy in their lineage‚Äîthat is, a trace of Jewish or Moorish blood or contamination by trade or commerce in either side of the family for many generations. The records of this commission have been found among the archives of the Order of Santiago. Vel√°zquez was awarded the honor in 1659. His occupation as plebeian and tradesman was justified because, as painter to the king, he was evidently not involved in the practice of \\"selling\\" pictures. =Final years= Detail of Las Meninas (Vel√°zquez's self-portrait) Portrait of the eight-year-old Infanta Margarita Teresa in a Blue Dress (1659) There were essentially only two patrons of art in Spain‚Äîthe church and the art-loving king and court. Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, who toiled for a rich and powerful church, left little means to pay for his burial, while Vel√°zquez lived and died in the enjoyment of a good salary and pension. One of his final works was Las hilanderas (The Spinners), painted circa 1657, a depiction of Ovid's Fable of Arachne. The tapestry in the background is based on Titian's The Rape of Europa, or, more probably, the copy that Rubens painted in Madrid.Bird, Wendy. \\"The Bobbin and the Distaff\\" , Apollo, 2007-11-01. Retrieved on May 28, 2009. It is full of light, air and movement, featuring vibrant colors and careful handling. Anton Raphael Mengs said this work seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of will. It displays a concentration of all the art-knowledge Vel√°zquez had gathered during his long artistic career of more than forty years. The scheme is simple‚Äîa confluence of varied and blended red, bluish-green, gray and black. Vel√°zquez's final portraits of the royal children are among his finest works and in the Infanta Margarita Teresa in a Blue DressKunsthistorisches Museum, Wien \\"Infantin Margarita Teresa (1651‚Äì1673) in blauem Kleid | Diego Rodr√≠guez de Silva y Vel√°zquez | 1659 | Inv.

His only surviving portrait of the delicate and sickly Prince Felipe ProsperoKunsthistorisches Museum, Wien \\"Infant Philipp Prosper (1657‚Äì1661) | Diego Rodr√≠guez de Silva y Vel√°zquez | 1659 | Inv.

The hope that was placed at that time in the sole heir to the Spanish crown is reflected in the depiction: fresh red and white stand in contrast to late autumnal, morbid colors. A small dog with wide eyes looks at the viewer as if questioningly, and the largely pale background hints at a gloomy fate: the little prince was barely four years old when he died. As in all of the artist's late paintings, the handling of the colors is extraordinarily fluid and vibrant. In 1660 a peace treaty between France and Spain was consummated by the marriage of Maria Theresa with Louis XIV, and the ceremony took place on the Island of Pheasants, a small swampy island in the Bidassoa. Vel√°zquez was charged with the decoration of the Spanish pavilion and with the entire scenic display. He attracted much attention from the nobility of his bearing and the splendor of his costume. On June 26 he returned to Madrid, and on July 31 he was stricken with fever. Feeling his end approaching, he signed his will, appointing as his sole executors his wife and his firm friend named Fuensalida, keeper of the royal records. He died on August 6, 1660. He was buried in the Fuensalida vault of the church of San Juan Bautista, and within eight days his wife Juana was buried beside him. This church was destroyed by the French around 1809, so his place of interment is now unknown. There was much difficulty in adjusting the tangled accounts outstanding between Vel√°zquez and the treasury, and it was not until 1666, after the death of King Philip, that they were finally settled. Style and technique It is canonical to divide Vel√°zquez's career by his two visits to Italy. He rarely signed his pictures, and the royal archives give the dates of only his most important works. Internal evidence and history pertaining to his portraits supply the rest to a certain extent. Although acquainted with all the Italian schools and a friend of the foremost painters of his day, Vel√°zquez was strong enough to withstand external influences and work out for himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art. He rejected the pomp that characterized the portraiture of other European courts, and instead brought an even greater reserve to the understated formula for Habsburg portraiture established by Titian, Antonio Mor, and Alonso S√°nchez Coello.Carr et al. 2006, p. 30. He is known for using a rather limited palette, but he mixed the available paints with great skill to achieve varying hues.McKim-Smith et al. 1988. His pigments were not significantly different from those of his contemporaries and he mainly employed azurite, smalt, vermilion, red lake, lead-tin-yellow and ochres.Diego Vel√°zquez, ColourLex His early works were painted on canvases prepared with a red-brown ground. He adopted the use of light-gray grounds during his first trip to Italy, and continued using them for the rest of his life.Carr et al. 2006, pp. 71, 78. The change resulted in paintings with greater luminosity and a generally cool, silvery range of color.Carr et al. 2006, p. 79. Few drawings are securely attributed to Vel√°zquez.McKim-Smith, Gridley. (December 1979), \\"On Vel√°zquez's Working Method\\". The Art Bulletin. 61 (4): 589‚Äì603. Although preparatory drawings for some of his paintings exist, his method was to paint directly from life, and x-rays of his paintings reveal that he frequently made changes in his composition as a painting progressed. Legacy Vel√°zquez was not prolific; he is estimated to have produced between only 110 and 120 known canvases. He produced no etchings or engravings, and only a few drawings are attributed to him.Harris 1982, p. 178. Vel√°zquez is the most influential figure in the history of Spanish portraiture.Port√∫s 2004, p. 57. Although he had few immediate followers, Spanish court painters such as his son-in-law Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo and Juan Carre√±o de Miranda took inspiration from his work. Mazo closely mimicked his style and many paintings and copies by Mazo were formerly attributed to Vel√°zquez.Harris 1982, p. 183. Vel√°zquez's reputation languished in the eighteenth century, when Spanish court portraiture was dominated by artists of foreign birth and training. Towards the end of the century, his importance was increasingly recognized by intellectuals close to the Spanish court‚Äîan essay published In 1781 by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos said of Vel√°zquez that \\"when he died, the glory of Painting in Spain died with him.\\"Port√∫s 2004, p. 200. In 1778, Goya made a set of etchings after paintings by Vel√°zquez, as part of a project by the Count of Floridablanca to produce prints of paintings in the Royal Collection.Port√∫s 2004, p. 201. Goya's free copies reveal a searching engagement with the older master's work, which remained a model for Goya for the rest of his career.Port√∫s 2004, pp. 204‚Äì207. Vel√°zquez's work was little known outside of Spain until the nineteenth century.Harris 1982, p. 183. His paintings mostly escaped being stolen by the French marshals during the Peninsular War. In 1828, Sir David Wilkie wrote from Madrid that he felt himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of Vel√°zquez, and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this artist and the British school of portrait painters, especially Henry Raeburn. He was struck by the modern impression pervading Vel√°zquez's work in both landscape and portraiture. Vel√°zquez is often cited as a key influence on the art of √âdouard Manet, who is often considered the bridge between realism and impressionism. Calling Vel√°zquez the \\"painter of painters\\", Manet admired the immediacy and vivid brushwork of Vel√°zquez's work, and built upon Vel√°zquez's motifs in his own art.Schjeldahl, Peter (November 10, 2002). \\"The Spanish Lesson: Manet's gift from Vel√°zquez\\". The New Yorker. Retrieved May 25, 2019. In the late nineteenth century, artists such as James McNeill Whistler and John Singer Sargent were strongly influenced by Vel√°zquez. =Modern recreations of classics= The respect with which twentieth century painters regard Vel√°zquez's work attests to its continuing importance. Pablo Picasso paid homage to Vel√°zquez in 1957 when he recreated Las Meninas in 44 variations, in his characteristic style.Harris 1982, p. 177. Although Picasso was concerned that his reinterpretations of Vel√°zquez's painting would be seen merely as copies rather than unique representations, the enormous works‚Äîincluding the largest he had produced since Guernica in 1937‚Äîobtained a position of importance in the canon of Spanish art. Salvador Dal√≠, as with Picasso in anticipation of the tercentennial of Vel√°zquez's death, created in 1958 a work entitled Vel√°zquez Painting the Infanta Margarita With the Lights and Shadows of His Own Glory. The color scheme shows Dal√≠'s serious tribute to Vel√°zquez; the work also functioned, as in Picasso's case, as a vehicle for the presentation of newer theories in art and thought‚Äînuclear mysticism, in Dal√≠'s case. The Anglo-Irish painter Francis Bacon found Vel√°zquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X to be \\"one of the greatest portraits ever\\".Arya, Rina (2009). \\"Painting the Pope: An Analysis of Francis Bacon's Study After Vel√°zquez's Portrait of Innocent X\\". Literature and Theology, 23 (1), 33‚Äì50. He created several expressionist variations of this piece in the 1950s; however, Bacon's paintings presented a more gruesome image of Innocent. One such famous variation, entitled Figure with Meat (1954), shows the pope between two halves of a bisected cow. =Recent rediscoveries of Vel√°zquez originals= In 2009, the Portrait of a Man in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had long been associated with the followers of Vel√°zquez' style of painting, was cleaned and restored. It was found to be by Vel√°zquez himself, and the features of the man match those of a figure in the painting \\"the Surrender of Breda\\". The newly cleaned canvas may therefore be a study for that painting. Although the attribution to Vel√°zquez is regarded as certain, the identity of the sitter is still open to question. Some art historians regard this new study to be a self-portrait by Vel√°zquez.http://www.metmuseum.org/Special/se_event.asp?OccurrenceId=%7B97C73240-8088-439F-890E-CAD28F8ACE41%7D In 2010 it was reported that a damaged painting long relegated to a basement of the Yale University Art Gallery might be an early work by Vel√°zquez. Thought to have been given to Yale in 1925, the painting has previously been attributed to the 17th-century Spanish school. Some scholars are prepared to attribute the painting to Vel√°zquez, though the Prado Museum in Madrid is reserving judgment. The work, which depicts the Virgin Mary being taught to read, will be restored by conservators at Yale. In October 2011 it was confirmed by art historian Dr. Peter Cherry of Trinity College Dublin through x-ray analysis that a portrait found in the UK in the former collection of the 19th-century painter Matthew Shepperson is a previously unknown work by Vel√°zquez. The portrait is of an unidentified man in his fifties or sixties, who could possibly be Juan Mateos, the Master of the Hunt for Vel√°zquez's patron, King Philip IV of Spain. The painting measures 47 x 39 cm and was sold at auction on December 7, 2011, for ¬£3,000,000. =Descendants= Vel√°zquez, through his daughter Francisca de Silva Vel√°zquez y Pacheco (1619‚Äì1658), is an ancestor of the Marquesses of Monteleone, including Enriquetta (Henrietta) Casado de Monteleone (1725‚Äì1761) who in 1746 married Heinrich VI, Count Reuss zu K√∂stritz (1707‚Äì1783). Through them are descended a number of European royalty, among them King Felipe VI of Spain through his mother Sophia of Greece and Denmark, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, King Albert II of Belgium, Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.

In Greek mythology, Athamas () was a Boeotian king.Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.9.1  Family  He was a son of Aeolus and Enarete,Compare Hesiod, Catalogue of Women fr. 10(a)25‚Äì6 & Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.7.3 and sired several children by his first wife, the goddess Nephele, and his other wives Ino and Themisto.Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.9.1-2 Nephele first bore to him twins, a son Phrixus and a daughter Helle; and also a second son, Makistos. He subsequently married Ino, daughter of Cadmus, with whom he had two children: Learches and Melicertes.  Mythology  Tisiphone maddens Athamas & Ino (17th century) Phrixus and Helle were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the town's crop seeds so they would not grow. The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. But, before Phrixus could be killed, he and Helle were spirited away by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her) and died, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Ae√´tes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter Chalciope in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Ae√´tes hung in a tree in his kingdom. Athamas tearing apart his children by Godfried MaesLater, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele, causing Hera's intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck Athamas with insanity. Athamas went mad and slew one of his sons, Learchus; Ino, to escape the pursuit of her frenzied husband, threw herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea, Melicertes as Palaemon.Ovid. Metamorphoses, 4.416 Athamas, with the guilt of his son's murder upon him, was obliged to flee from Boeotia. He was ordered by the oracle to settle in a place where he should receive hospitality from wild beasts. This he found at Phthiotis in Thessaly, where he surprised some wolves eating sheep; on his approach they fled, leaving him the bones. Athamas, regarding this as the fulfilment of the oracle, settled there and married a third wife, Themisto (sons: Schoeneus, Leucon, Ptous and/or others). The spot was afterwards called the Athamanian plain. When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black. Ino switched their clothes without Themisto's knowledge, and she killed her own children. According to some accounts, Athamas was succeeded on the throne by Presbon.Presbon A part of Kingdom of Athamas, and himself, moved west north and took roots in a part of Pindus mountains in Epirus, called Athamanean mountains. So this population today is called Athamaneans.

It bordered Mysia to the southwest, Paphlagonia to the northeast along the Pontic coast, and Phrygia to the southeast towards the interior of Asia Minor. Bithynia was an independent kingdom from the 4th century BC. Its capital Nicomedia was rebuilt on the site of ancient Astacus in 264 BC by Nicomedes I of Bithynia. Bithynia was bequeathed to the Roman Republic in 74 BC, and became united with the Pontus region as the province of Bithynia et Pontus. In the 7th century it was incorporated into the Byzantine Opsikion theme. It became a border region to the Seljuk Empire in the 13th century, and was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Turks between 1325 and 1333. Description Several major cities sat on the fertile shores of the Propontis (which is now known as Sea of Marmara): Nicomedia, Chalcedon, Cius and Apamea. Bithynia also contained Nicaea, noted for being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed. According to Strabo, Bithynia was bounded on the east by the river Sangarius (modern Sakarya river), but the more commonly received division extended it to the Parthenius, which river separated it from Paphlagonia, thus comprising the district inhabited by the Mariandyni. On the west and southwest it was separated from Mysia by the river Rhyndacus and on the south it adjoined Phrygia and Galatia. It is occupied by mountains and forests, but has valleys and coastal districts of great fertility. The most important mountain range is the (so-called) \\"Mysian\\" Olympus (8000 ft., 2500 m), which towers above Bursa and is clearly visible as far away as Istanbul (70 miles, 113 km). Its summits are covered with snow for a great part of the year. East of this the range extends for more than 100 miles (160 km), from the Sakarya to Paphlagonia. Both of these ranges are part of the border of mountains which bound the great tableland of Anatolia, Turkey. The broad tract which projects towards the west as far as the shores of the Bosporus, though hilly and covered with forests ‚Äî the Turkish Aƒüa√ß Denizi, or \\"The sea of Trees\\" ‚Äî is not traversed by any mountain chain. The west coast is indented by two deep inlets, the northernmost, the Gulf of ƒ∞zmit (ancient Gulf of Astacus), penetrating between 40 and 50 miles (65‚Äì80 km) into the interior as far as ƒ∞zmit (ancient Nicomedia), separated by an isthmus of only about 25 miles (40 km) from the Black Sea; and the Gulf of Mudanya or Gemlik (Gulf of Cius), about 25 miles (40 km) long. At its extremity is situated the small town of Gemlik (ancient Cius) at the mouth of a valley, communicating with the lake of Iznik, on which was situated Nicaea. The principal rivers are the Sangarios which traverses the province from down to north; the Rhyndacus, which separated it from Mysia; and the Billaeus (Filyos), which rises in the Aladaƒü, about 50 miles (80 km) from the sea, and after flowing by modern Bolu (ancient Bithynion-Claudiopolis) falls into the Euxine, close to the ruins of the ancient Tium, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Heraclea Pontica (the modern Karadeniz Ereƒüli), having a course of more than 100 miles (160 km). The Parthenius (modern Bartƒ±n), the eastern boundary of the province, is a much less considerable stream. The valleys towards the Black Sea abound in fruit trees of all kinds, such as oranges, while the valley of the Sangarius and the plains near Bursa and Iznik (Nicaea) are fertile and well cultivated. Extensive plantations of mulberry trees supply the silk for which Bursa has long been celebrated, and which is manufactured there on a large scale. History Bithynia and Pontus as a province of the Roman Empire, 125 AD Photo of a 15th-century map showing Bithynia. =Iron Age= Bithynia is named for the Thracian tribe of the Bithyni, mentioned by Herodotus (VII.75) alongside the Thyni. The \\"Thraco-Phrygian\\" migration from the Balkans to Asia Minor would have taken place at some point following the Bronze Age collapse or during the early Iron Age. The Thyni and Bithyni appear to have settled simultaneously in the adjoining parts of Asia, where they expelled or subdued the Mysians, Caucones and other minor tribes, the Mariandyni maintaining themselves in the northeast. Herodotus mentions the Thyni and Bithyni as settling side by side. No trace of their original language has been preserved, but Herodotus describes them as related to the tribes of Thracian extraction like the Phrygians and Armenians, whose languages may form part of the Paleo- Balkan group (although this is not certain and the theory is not universally accepted). Later the Greeks established on the coast the colonies of Cius (modern Gemlik); Chalcedon (modern Kadƒ±k√∂y), at the entrance of the Bosporus, nearly opposite Byzantium (modern Istanbul) and Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereƒüli), on the Euxine, about 120 miles (190 km) east of the Bosporus. The Bithynians were incorporated by king Croesus within the Lydian monarchy, with which they fell under the dominion of Persia (546 BC), and were included in the satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised all the countries up to the Hellespont and Bosporus. =Kingdom of Bithynia= Even before the conquest by Alexander the Bithynians appear to have asserted their independence, and successfully maintained it under two native princes, Bas and Zipoites, the latter of whom assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BC. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign ( BC), as well as those of his successors, Prusias I, Prusias II and Nicomedes II (14991 BC), the kingdom of Bithynia had a considerable standing and influence among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. But the last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself in power against Mithridates VI of Pontus. After being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom through his will to the Roman republic (74 BC). The coinage of these kings show their regal portraits, which tend to be engraved in an extremely accomplished Hellenistic style.Asia Minor Coins - regal Bithynian coins =Roman province= As a Roman province, the boundaries of Bithynia changed frequently. During this period, Bithynia was commonly united for administrative purposes with the province of Pontus. This was the situation at the time of Emperor Trajan, when Pliny the Younger was appointed governor of the combined provinces (109/110111/112), a circumstance which has provided historians with valuable information concerning the Roman provincial administration at that time. = Byzantine province = Under the Byzantine Empire, Bithynia was again divided into two provinces, separated by the Sangarius. Only the area to the west of the river retained the name of Bithynia. Bithynia attracted much attention because of its roads and its strategic position between the frontiers of the Danube in the north and the Euphrates in the south-east. To secure communications with the eastern provinces, the monumental bridge across the river Sangarius was constructed around 562 AD. Troops frequently wintered at Nicomedia. During this time, the most important cities in Bithynia were Nicomedia, founded by Nicomedes, and Nicaea. The two had a long rivalry with each other over which city held the rank of capital.

Life He commenced his reign by putting to death two of his brothers but the third, subsequently called Zipoetes II, raised an insurrection against him and succeeded in maintaining himself, for some time, in the independent sovereignty of a considerable part of Bithynia. Meanwhile, Nicomedes was threatened with an invasion from Antiochus I Soter, king of the Seleucid Empire, who had already made war upon his father, Zipoetes I, and, to strengthen himself against this danger, he concluded an alliance with Heraclea Pontica and shortly afterwards with Antigonus II Gonatas. The threatened attack, however, passed over with little injury. Antiochus actually invaded Bithynia but withdrew again without risking a battle. It was more against his brother than his foreign enemies that Nicomedes now called in the assistance of more powerful auxiliaries and entered into an alliance with the Celts who, under Leonnorius and Lutarius, had arrived on the opposite side of the Bosphorus and were, at this time, engaged in the siege of Byzantium, 277 BC. Having furnished them with the means of crossing into Asia, where they founded Galatia, he first turned the arms of his new auxiliaries against Zipoetes II, whom he defeated and put to death, and thus reunited the whole of Bithynia under his dominion. Of the events that followed we have little information. It is probable that the Celts subsequently assisted Nicomedes against Antiochus but no particulars are recorded, either of the war or the peace that terminated it. It appears, however, that Nicomedes was left in the undisturbed possession of Bithynia, which he continued to govern from this time till his death and which rose to a high degree of power and prosperity during his long and peaceful reign. In imitation of his father, and so many others of the Greek rulers of Asia, he determined to perpetuate his own name by the foundation of a new capital and the site that he chose, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Megarian colony of Astakos, was so judiciously selected that the city of Nicomedia continued for more than six centuries to be one of the richest and most flourishing in Anatolia. The founding of Nicomedia is placed by Eusebius in 264 BC. The duration of the reign of Nicomedes himself, after this event, is unknown but his death is assigned to around the year 255 BC. He had been twice married; by his first wife, Ditizele, a Phrygian by birth he had two sons, Prusias and Ziaelas, and a daughter, Lysandra; but his second wife, Etazeta, persuaded him to set aside his children by his first marriage and leave his crown to her offspring. The latter were still infants at the time of his death, on which account he confided their guardianship, by his will, to the two kings, Antigonus II Gonatas and Ptolemy II Philadelphus, together with the free cities of Heraclea Pontica, Byzantium and Cius. But, notwithstanding this precaution, his son Ziaelas quickly established himself on the throne. It is probably this Nicomedes who sought to purchase from the city of Knidos the celebrated statue of Venus, by Praxiteles, by offering to remit the whole public debt of the city.

Ixion's restraint failed him, and he coupled with Nephele, eventually fathering the Centaurs (through ImbrosTzetzes, Chiliades 9.20 line 464, 469 & 477 or CentaurosPseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca Epitome of Book 4.1.20).

In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the Golden Fleece of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom. The Golden Fleece would later be taken by Jason and his Argonauts.

He had three half siblings, Nysa by his fathers second marriage to Nysa, and a half brother named Socrates Chrestus from his fathers concubine Hagne and possibly Pylaemenes III by an unknown woman. His reign began at the death of his father. The first few years of his kingship were relatively peaceful, but soon King Mithridates VI of Pontus (the maternal grand-uncle of Nicomedes IV), one of Rome's greatest enemies during the late Republic, began harassing Bithynia's borders. Nicomedes IV's brother, Socrates Chrestus, assisted by Mithridates VI, defeated Nicomedes IV's army in 90 BC, and Nicomedes IV was forced to flee to Italy. He was restored to his throne by Manius Aquillius due to Rome's influence in the region.Smith, p. 1197 However, Aquillius encouraged Nicomedes IV to raid Mithridates VI's territory, prompting Mithridates VI to retaliate again in 88 BC. Nicomedes IV fled once again to Rome. Mithridates invaded and conquered Bithynia and the Roman provinces of Asia starting the First Mithridatic War.J. Hind, 'Mithridates', in Cambridge Ancient History, Volume IX (1994), pp.143‚Äì4 The East was seen by the Romans as a province providing an abundance of gold and silver. As such, two powerful Romans, Gaius Marius and the Consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla aimed at a command in the region. After a short civil war, Sulla sailed east and fought Mithridates VI on several occasions over the next three years, and finally in 85 BC, Mithridates VI sued for peace, and was allowed to retain his kingship in Pontus after paying a heavy fine. Nicomedes IV was restored to his throne in Bithynia in 84 BC. The years that followed were relatively peaceful, though Bithynia came more and more under the control of Rome. In 80 BC, young Gaius Julius Caesar was an ambassador to Nicomedes IV's court. Caesar was sent to raise a fleet using Bithynia's resources, but he dallied so long with the King that a rumor of a sexual relationship between the two men surfaced, leading to the disparaging title for Caesar, \\"the Queen of Bithynia\\", an allegation which Caesar's political enemies made use of later in his life. During Caesar's Gallic Triumph a popular verse began: \\"Gallias Caesar subegit, Caesarem Nicomedes,\\" (Caesar laid the Gauls low, Nicomedes laid Caesar low), suggesting that Caesar was the receiving partner in the relationship.Suetonius ii., 45‚Äì53 It is unknown if a sexual relationship was true or just a story generated by his opponents and Caesar denied its truthfulness vigorously. As one of his last acts as king of Bithynia, in 74 BC, Nicomedes IV bequeathed the entire kingdom of Bithynia to Rome. The Roman Senate quickly voted it as a new province. Rome's old enemy Mithridates VI had other plans for Bithynia, however, and Nicomedes IV's death and bequeathal led directly to the Third Mithridatic War.

South fa√ßade of the Cour Carr√©e in the Palais du Louvre. |442x442px In Greek mythology Ino (Ancient Greek: ·º∏ŒΩœé, Henry George Liddell. Robert Scott. A Greek-English Lexicon) was a mortal queen of Boeotia, who after her death and transfiguration was worshiped as a goddess under her epithet Leucothea, the \\"white goddess.\\" Alcman called her \\"Queen of the Sea\\" (),Alcman, fragment 83. which, if not hyperbole, would make her a doublet of Amphitrite.  Family  Ino was the second wife of the Minyan king Athamas, mother of Learchus and Melicertes and stepmother of Phrixus and Helle. She was the second daughter of Cadmus and HarmoniaHesiod, who calls her only Ino, lists her among the \\"glorious offspring\\" of unions between a mortal and a goddess (Theogony. 975f). and one of the three sisters of Semele, the mortal woman of the house of Cadmus who gave birth to Dionysus. The three sisters were Agave, Autono√´ and Ino, who was a surrogate for the divine nurses of Dionysus: > Ino was a primordial Dionysian woman, nurse to the god and a divine maenad. > (Kerenyi 1976:246)  Mythology  Maenads were reputed to tear their own children limb from limb in their madness. In the back-story to the heroic tale of Jason and the Golden Fleece, Phrixus and Helle, twin children of Athamas and Nephele, were hated by their stepmother, Ino. Ino hatched a devious plot to get rid of the twins, roasting all the crop seeds of Boeotia so they would not grow.Bibliotheke i.9.1; \\"it is possible, however\\", Kerenyi suggests (The Gods of the Greeks p 264) \\"that originally she did not cause the seed-corn to be roasted, but introduced the practice of roasting corn in general.\\" The local farmers, frightened of famine, asked a nearby oracle for assistance. Ino bribed the men sent to the oracle to lie and tell the others that the oracle required the sacrifice of Phrixus. Athamas reluctantly agreed. Before he was killed though, Phrixus and Helle were rescued by a flying golden ram sent by Nephele, their natural mother. Helle fell off the ram into the Hellespont (which was named after her, meaning Sea of Helle) and drowned, but Phrixus survived all the way to Colchis, where King Aeetes took him in and treated him kindly, giving Phrixus his daughter, Chalciope, in marriage. In gratitude, Phrixus gave the king the golden fleece of the ram, which Aeetes hung in a tree in his kingdom.Fragment de mosaique : Ino (Dot√¥), d√©couverte dans une villa romaine de Saint-Rustice en 1833, IV√® ou V√® si√®cle, MSR, Mus√©e Saint-RaymonLater, Ino raised Dionysus, her nephew, son of her sister Semele,Local tradition sited the suckling of Dionysus at Brasiai in Laconia. (Kerenyi 1951:264). causing Hera's intense jealousy. In vengeance, Hera struck Athamas with insanity. Athamas went mad, slew one of his sons, Learchus, thinking he was a ram, and set out in frenzied pursuit of Ino. To escape him Ino threw herself into the sea with her son Melicertes. Both were afterwards worshipped as marine divinities, Ino as Leucothea (\\"the white goddess\\"), Melicertes as Palaemon. Alternatively, Ino was also stricken with insanity and killed Melicertes by boiling him in a cauldron, then took the cauldron and jumped into the sea with it. A sympathetic Zeus did not want Ino to die, and transfigured her and Melicertes as Leucothea and Palaemon. Athamas tue le fils d'Ino by Gaetano Gandolfi (1801) The story of Ino, Athamas and Melicertes is relevant also in the context of two larger themes. Ino, daughter of Cadmus and Harmonia, had an end just as tragic as her siblings: Semele died while pregnant with Zeus' child, killed by her own pride and lack of trust in her lover; Agave killed her own son, King Pentheus, while struck with Dionysian madness, and Actaeon, son of Autonoe, the third sibling, was torn apart by his own hunting dogs. Also, the insanity of Ino and Athamas, who hunted his own son Learchus as a stag and slew him, can be explained as a result of their contact with Dionysus, whose presence can cause insanity. None can escape the powers of Dionysus, the god of wine. Euripides took up the tale in The Bacchae, explaining their madness in Dionysiac terms, as a result of their having initially resisted belief in the god's divinity. When Athamas returned to his second wife, Ino, Themisto (his third wife) sought revenge by dressing her children in white clothing and Ino's in black and directing the murder of the children in black. Ino switched their clothes without Themisto knowing and she killed her own children. Transformed into the goddess Leucothea, Ino also represents one of the many sources of divine aid to Odysseus in the Odyssey (5:333ff), her earliest appearance in literature. Homer calls her \\"Ino- Leocothea of the beautiful ankles [Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒØœÉœÜœÖœÅŒøœÇ], daughter of Cadmus, who was once a mortal speaking with the tongue of men, but now in the salt sea-waters has received honor at the hands of the gods\\". Providing Odysseus with a veil and telling him to discard his cloak and raft, she instructs him how he can entrust himself to the waves and succeed in reaching land and eventually the island of Scheria (Corcyra), home of Phaeaceans. In historical times, a sisterhood of maenads of Thebes in the service of Dionysus traced their descent in the female line from Ino; we know this because an inscription at Magnesia on the Maeander summoned three maenads from Thebes, from the house of Ino, to direct the new mysteries of Dionysus at Magnesia (Burkert 1992:44).

Considered one of the greatest of his dynasty to ever rule, he was known as Mithridates the Great in antiquity. Mithridates II was crowned king after the abrupt death of his predecessor Artabanus I. Inheriting a declining empire that was reeling from military pressure in both the east and west, Mithridates II quickly stabilized the situation in Mesopotamia by gaining the allegiance of Characene, and subduing the insurgent Kingdom of Elymais and also the Arabs, who had continuously raided Babylonia. Mithridates II was the first Parthian king to extend Parthian rule into Caucasus, where the kingdoms of Armenia, Iberia, and possibly Caucasian Albania became Parthian vassal states. To the east, he defeated and conquered the nomadic tribes in Bactria who had killed both of his predecessors. Sakastan was also reconquered, which was given as a fiefdom to the House of Suren. In 114/113 BC, he seized Dura-Europos in Syria from the Seleucids, and by 95 BC, the northern Mesopotamian kingdoms of Adiabene, Gordyene, and Osrhoene had acknowledged his authority. Under Mithridates II, the Parthian Empire at its zenith extended from Syria and the Caucasus to Central Asia and India. It was under Mithridates II that the Parthian Empire for the first time established diplomatic relations with Rome and Han China. A champion of Achaemenid traditions, Mithridates II was determined to emphasize the association of the ruling Arsacid dynasty with the Iranian Achaemenid Empire. He was the first Parthian monarch to regularly use the title King of Kings, and portray himself with an Iranian tiara on the obverse of his coins, contrary to the Hellenistic diadem used by his earlier predecessors. He also replaced the omphalos on the reverse of his coins with a highbacked throne of Achaemenid origin. Name \\"Mithridates\\" is the Greek attestation of the Iranian name MihrdƒÅt, meaning \\"given by Mithra\\", the name of the ancient Iranian sun god. The name itself is derived from Old Iranian MiŒ∏ra-dƒÅta-. Mithra is a prominent figure in Zoroastrian sources, where he plays the role of the patron of khvarenah, i.e. kingly glory. Mithra played an important under the late Iranian Achaemenid Empire, and continued to grow throughout the Greek Seleucid period, where he was associated with the Greek gods Apollo or Helios, or the Babylonian god Nabu. The role of Mithra peaked under the Parthians, which according to the modern historian Marek Jan Olbrycht, \\"seems to have been due to Zoroastrian struggles against the spread of foreign faiths in the Hellenistic period.\\"  Parentage  The identity of Mithridates II's father is uncertain. According to 2nd-century Roman historian Justin, Mithridates II was a son of his predecessor, Artabanus I. A cuneiform tablet from 119 BC, however, cites Mithridates II; \\"of the Gutians who killed my brother Artabanus, and I set up (troops) opposite them and fought it with them; a great killing I performed among them; except two men.\\" *Son of Priapatius: According to Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis (2019), Mithridates II was referring to Artabanus I as his brother in the cuneiform. She argues that Mithridates II was a son of Priapatius (also spelled Friapatak), which is also supported by an ostracon created in 91/90 BC in Nisa. On the ostracon, a Parthian king, most likely Mithridates II's son Gotarzes, is mentioned as \\"Arsaces King, grandson of Friapatak [who is] the son of the nephew of Arsaces [I].\\" *Son of Artabanus I: Olbrycht (2010), however, suggests that Mithridates II was not Artabanus I's brother, but a son of his. He states that Mithridates II would have been a middle aged man the time of his accession, due to Priapatius dying in 176 BC. According to Olbrycht, \\"While not impossible, it is historically unlikely since Mithradates II's natural contestants for the throne would have been the sons of Phraates II and Mithridates I.\\" Unlike Mithridates I and Artabanus I (who were the sons of Priapatius), Mithridates II did not use the title of Theopatoros (\\"whose father is a god\\"). This brother named Artabanus is not referred to as king in cuneiform, and was most likely a high-ranking officer who died in war. Early expeditions in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus Map depicting the Near East during the Hellenistic era, by Joseph Thomas (1835) At the time of his succession, the Parthian Empire was reeling from military pressures in the West and East. Several humiliating defeats at the hands of eastern nomads had sapped the strength and prestige of the kingdom. Mithridates II quickly gained the allegiance of the Characenean ruler Hyspaosines, who had originally fought the Parthians, and briefly seized Babylon in 127 BC. Hyspaosines returned the wooden throne of Arsaces to Mithridates II as a gift to the god Bel. Mithridates II now turned his eyes on Elymais, which had been originally under direct Parthian rule, but had been seized by the independent Elamite king Pittit after Artabanus I's death. Mithridates II invaded Elymais and captured Susa. Then he confronted Pittit in a final battle, where he defeated him and conquered Elymais. Around the same time, Hyspaosines died, and the Parthian commander Sindates was appointed as the governor of Characene. It was first under Mithridates II that Parthian rule extended into the Caucasus. He noticed the strategic position of Armenia between Asia Minor, the Caucasus, and Iran. In , Mithridates II invaded Armenia and made its king Artavasdes I acknowledge Parthian suzerainty. Artavasdes I was forced to give the Parthians Tigranes as a hostage, who was either his son or nephew. Control over Armenia would remain one of the most essential objectives in Parthian policy till the end of the dynasty. Other Caucasian kingdoms such as Iberia most likely also became a Parthian vassal state, and possibly also Caucasian Albania. Massive circulation of Parthian coins into Iberia, along with Armenia and Caucasian Albania, indicates that these kingdoms had been swayed by the influence of the Parthians. According to Babylonian documents, Babylonia was constantly suffering from raids by Arabs, which had agitated Mithridates II considerably. In the spring of 119 BC, a Parthian force inflicted a defeat on the Arabs, which was heavy enough to make them stop their raids for a period. It is unclear whether the force was led by Mithridates II or a Parthian commander. The Parthian force most likely left for Media afterwards, seemingly in order to join the upcoming expedition against the nomads in the east. Parthian interests were also directed towards Syria, which had first been demanded by the Parthians after Phraates II () defeated the Seleucid king (basileus) Antiochus VII Sidetes () in 129 BC. In 114/113 BC, Mithridates II captured the important Seleucid city of Dura-Europos, which was situated on the Euphrates. The Seleucid realm was at this time frail and entangled in ceaseless internal strifes and struggles for power against the Nabataeans, various local kings, Jews, and Greek cities in Syria and Phoenicia.  Wars to the east  According to Justin, Mithridates II avenged the death of his \\"parents or ancestors\\" (ultor iniuriae parentum), which indicates that he fought and defeated the Tocharians, who had killed Artabanus I and Phraates II. Mithridates II also reconquered western Bactria from the Scythians. Parthian coinage and scattered reports imply that Mithridates II ruled Bactra, Kampyrtepa, and Termez, which means that he had reconquered the very lands that been conquered by his namesake Mithridates I (). Control over the middle Amu Darya including Amul was vital for the Parthians, in order to thwart incursions by nomads from Transoxiana, particularly from Sogdia. Parthian coins continued to be minted in western Bactria and in the middle Amu Darya until the reign of Gotarzes II (). Nomadic invasions had also reached the eastern Parthian province of Drangiana, where strong Saka dominions had been established, thus giving the rise to the name Sakastan (\\"land of the Saka\\"). These nomads had probably migrated to the area due to the pressure that Artabanus I and Mithridates II had been putting against them in the north. Sometime between 124 and 115 BC, Mithridates II sent an army led by a general of the House of Suren to recapture to the region. After Sakastan was incorporated back into the Parthian realm, Mithridates II rewarded the region to the Surenid general as his fiefdom. The eastern extent of the Parthian Empire under Mithridates II reached as far as Arachosia.  Further expansions to the west, and contact with the Romans  Tigranes remained a hostage at the Parthian court until , when Mithridates II released him and appointed as the king of Armenia. Tigranes ceded an area called \\"seventy valleys\\" in the Caspiane to Mithridates II, either as a pledge or because Mithridates II demanded it. Tigranes' daughter Ariazate had also married a son of Mithridates II, which has been suggested by the modern historian Edward DƒÖbrowa to have taken place shortly before he ascended the Armenian throne as a guarantee of his loyalty. Tigranes would remain a Parthian vassal until the end of the 80s BC. The following year, Mithridates II attacked Adiabene, Gordyene and Osrhoene and conquered these city states, shifting the western border of the Parthian realm to the Euphrates. There the Parthians encountered the Romans for the first time. In 96 BC Mithridates II sent one of his officials, Orobazus, as an envoy to Sulla. As the Romans were increasing in power and influence, the Parthians sought friendly relations with the Romans and thus wanted to reach an agreement that assured mutual respect between the two powers. Negotiations followed in which Sulla apparently gained the upper hand, which made Orobazus and the Parthians look like supplicants. Orobazus would later be executed.Plutarch, Life of Sulla 5.4  Diplomatic activity with China  Han-dynasty Chinese silk from Mawangdui, 2nd century BC, silk from China was perhaps the most lucrative luxury item the Parthians traded at the western end of the Silk Road In 121 BC the Chinese under Emperor Wu of Han had defeated the Xiongnu in the east and were expanding westwards in force. In Ferghana the Chinese encountered the sphere of influence of the Parthians. A Chinese delegation to the Parthian court is attested for the year 120 BC. In the following year the Silk Road was opened up to trade. The strength and welfare of the empire under Mithridates II has been described by one Chinese traveler as the following:  Death and succession  Mithridates II's last years of rule took place in a period coined in scholarship as the \\"Parthian Dark Age,\\" which refers to a period of three decades in the history of Parthian Empire starting from the death (or last years) of Mithridates II. It is referred to as a \\"Dark Age\\" due to the lack of clear information on the events of this period in the empire, except a series of, apparently overlapping, reigns.; ; It is only with the beginning of the reign of Orodes II in , that the line of Parthian rulers can again be reliably traced. Coins, reliefs and Babylonian astronomical diaries label Gotarzes as the son and heir of Mithridates II. According to a heavily damaged relief at Behistun, Gotarzes had served as \\"satrap of satraps\\" under his father. After the death of Mithridates II in 91 BC, Gotarzes was proclaimed king at Babylon.  Rock relief  Sketch of the rock relief portraying Mithridates II and four grandees at Mount Behistun At Mount Behistun in western Iran, there is a rock relief which depicts four figures paying respect to a fifth figure. The relief, along with its Greek inscription, heavily damaged, was partly reconstructed by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld (d. 1948), and reads the following: Rahim M. Shayegan (2011), has suggested, contrary to other scholars, that the rock relief was not constructed during the reign of Mithridates II, but during that of his son and successor Gotarzes, perhaps as an attempt to stress the legitimacy of his sovereignty by portraying the prestigious status of himself and his officers during Mithridates II's kingship. He identifies the first figure with the Parthian satrap Kofzad; the second figure with the Parthian commander Mitratu, who first rose to a distinguished position under Gotarzes; the third figure with Gotarzes' son and heir Orodes; and the fourth with Gotarzes himself, who served as \\"satrap of satraps\\" under his father.  Imperial ideology and Coinage  Tetradrachm of Mithridates II, Seleucia mint Since the early 2nd-century BC, the Arsacids had begun adding obvious signals in their dynastic ideology, which emphasized their association with the heritage of the ancient Achaemenid Empire. Examples of these signs included a fictitious claim that the first Arsacid king, Arsaces I () was a descendant of the Achaemenid King of Kings, Artaxerxes II (). Achaemenid titles were also assumed by the Arsacids, including the title of \\"King of Kings\\" by Mithridates I (). However, the title was only infrequently used by Mithridates I, and it was first under Mithridates II, from c. 109/8 BC onwards, that the use of the title became a regular feature. The new title was used both on coins and engravings (attested in Greek as BAŒ£IŒõEŒ•Œ£ BAŒ£IŒõEŒ©N), and also Babylonian accounts, where it is attested as ≈°ar ≈°arrƒÅni. Mithridates II was more determined than his predecessors as heir and guardian of Achaemenid heritage. Drachm of Mithridates II wearing a diadem Drachm of Mithridates II wearing a tiara, minted at Rhages between 96-92 BC At the start of his reign, Mithridates II briefly used the Greek title Soter (\\"Saviour\\") at the start of his reign, which was used on his coin mints in Ecbatana and Rhages. The reason behind his use of the title is uncertain. Olbrycht (2010) has proposed that he adopted the title due to his victory over the nomads, while Grenet (2006) has proposed that Soter could be seen as a Mithraic title from an Iranian point of view, in connection to Mithra's role as a saviour in Zoroastrianism. Drachm of the Sasanian king Ardashir I () wearing the same type of tiara used by Mithridates II The early Arsacid monarchs are depicted on the obverse of their coins with a soft cap, known as the bashlyk, which had also been worn by Achaemenid satraps. From Mithridates I, the Hellenistic diadem was used by the Arsacid kings. The diadem was also used during the early reign of Mithridates II, until he later started using a tall bejewelled tiara or kolah (tall hat).; ; The tiara was of Median origin; in the Achaemenid era, high ranking Median officers wore a tall, domed headdress, which was part of the Median national dress. Media, a region in central Iran which neighboured Parthia, was an important part of the Parthian realm under Mithridates II. According to Justin, the Parthian language shared many features with Median. The Parthians admired Median customs, and seemingly got familiar with Achaemenid heritage through Media. The tiara would be used by many Parthian kings, particularly in the late Parthian period.; This type of tiara was also later used by the vassal kings of the Parthians, such as the Kings of Persis. The founder of the Sasanian Empire, Ardashir I (), also used this tiara. Like Artabanus I, Mithridates II is depicted on the obverse of his coins wearing an Iranian rider garb‚Äîthe Parthian trouser-suit. The reverse of Mithridates II's coin mints also see a major chance during his reign. Since the start of the Arsacid dynasty, the reverse of the coins had depicted a seated bowman wearing a bashlyk, which greatly resembled the coins of the Achaemenid satrap Datames (d. 362 BC). The bowman was originally depicted seated on a diphros, however, under Mithridates I this was changed to an omphalos. Tetradrachms minted at Seleucia and Susa under Mithridates II, including his early coin mints from central Iran and Marw in Margiana, maintained the same style. However, on the coins minted in Ecbatana and Rhages, a tail-like piece of fabric has been added on the back of the bowman. In 117‚Äì111 BC, the omphalos was replaced by a highbacked throne, which was originally used in the Achaemenid era. The long piece of fabric has also been removed. During military assemblies and campaigns, a horse or gorytos was depicted on the reverse of his coins.  Assessment and legacy  Map of the Parthian Empire under Mithridates II Mithridates II is viewed favourably by both ancient and modern historians, who consider him one of the greatest and successful Parthian monarchs to ever rule.; Justin says the following about him; References Bibliography = Ancient works = *Strabo, Geographica. *Justin, Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus. = Modern works = * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:91 BC deaths Category:2nd-century BC rulers in Asia Category:1st-century BC Parthian monarchs Category:2nd-century BC births Category:2nd-century BC Iranian people Category:2nd-century BC Babylonian kings Category:1st-century BC Babylonian kings Category:2nd-century BC Parthian monarchs ","title":"Mithridates II of Parthia"},{"id":"77444","text":"Commercial law, also known as mercantile law or trade law, is the body of law that applies to the rights, relations, and conduct of persons and businesses engaged in commerce, merchandising, trade, and sales. It is often considered to be a branch of civil law and deals with issues of both private law and public law. Commercial law includes within its compass such titles as principal and agent; carriage by land and sea; merchant shipping; guarantee; marine, fire, life, and accident insurance; bills of exchange, negotiable instruments, contracts and partnership. Many of these categories fall within Financial law, an aspect of Commercial law pertaining specifically to financing and the financial markets. It can also be understood to regulate corporate contracts, hiring practices, and the manufacture and sales of consumer goods. Many countries have adopted civil codes that contain comprehensive statements of their commercial law. In the United States, commercial law is the province of both the United States Congress, under its power to regulate interstate commerce, and the states, under their police power. Efforts have been made to create a unified body of commercial law in the United States; the most successful of these attempts has resulted in the general adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, which has been adopted in all 50 states (with some modification by state legislatures), the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Various regulatory schemes control how commerce is conducted, particularly vis-a-vis employees and customers. Privacy laws, safety laws (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health Act in the United States), and food and drug laws are some examples. History During Middle Ages, Italy was the cradle of many modern institutions at the basis of commercial law. Around 16th century, the trade of Italian maritime republics was the promoter of the birth of commercial law: the jurist Benvenuto Stracca, (Ancona, 1509 - 1579) published in 1553 the treatise De mercatura seu mercatore tractats; it was one of the first, if not the first, legal imprint dealing specifically with commercial law. This treatise focused on merchants and merchant contracts, practices and maritime rights, to which he soon added extensive discussions of bankruptcy, factors and commissions, third party transfers, and insurance. For this reason, Stracca is often considered the father of the commercial law and author of the first Italian treaty about the insurance contract, beyond about the commerce. The legal work of Italian jurists had an impact on Holland, Germany, England and France. *Modernisation, National Identity and Legal Instrumentalism (Vol. I: Private Law): Studies in Comparative Legal History, Brill, 2019 (p. 118); *Vito Piergiovanni, The Courts and the Development of Commercial Law, Duncker & Humblot, 1987 (p. 14); *Encyclopedia Treccani, Benvenuto Stracca See also * Outline of commercial law * Consulate of the Sea NotesExternal links * Hundreds of Answers to Basic Business Law Questions * Topical listing of US commercial law from Cornell's Legal Information Institute ","title":"Commercial law"},{"id":"77445","text":"Location of the Zuid-Willemsvaart Zuid-Willemsvaart in Weert The Zuid- Willemsvaart (; translated: South William's Canal) is a canal in the south of the Netherlands and the east of Belgium.

The canal was named after King William I of the Netherlands, with \\"South\\" added to avoid confusion with two other canals commissioned by and named after the King: the Willemskanaal near Zwolle and the Noord-Willemskanaal in the province of Groningen. King William ordered the planning of the canal, and construction started in 1823. The canal was completed in 1826 and named for the king. The 123 km-long canal runs through the Belgian province of Limburg, the Dutch province of Limburg and, for the largest part, through the Dutch province of North Brabant. At the time of the canal's construction, all of these regions were part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815-1830/39). The canal created new possibilities for development of the poor towns on the sandy grounds of North Brabant, such as Helmond and Veghel and created an alternative traderoute for ships that did not want to sail the Meuse.

In Greek mythology, Leucothea (; Leukoth√©a, \\"white goddess\\") or Leucotho√´ was one of the aspects under which an ancient sea goddess was recognized, in this case as a transformed nymph.  Mythology  In the more familiar variant, Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, sister of Semele, and queen of Athamas, became a goddess after Hera drove her insane as a punishment for caring for the newborn Dionysus. She leapt into the sea with her son Melicertes in her arms, and out of pity, the Hellenes asserted, the Olympian gods turned them both into sea- gods, transforming Melicertes into Palaemon, the patron of the Isthmian games, and Ino into Leucothea. In the version sited at Rhodes, a much earlier mythic level is reflected in the genealogy: there, the woman who plunged into the sea and became Leucothea was Halia (\\"of the sea\\", a personification of the saltiness of the sea) whose parents were from the ancient generation, Thalassa and Pontus or Uranus. She was a local nymph and one of the aboriginal Telchines of the island. Halia became Poseidon's wife and bore him Rhodos and six sons; the sons were maddened by Aphrodite in retaliation for an impious affront, assaulted their sister and were confined beneath the Earth by Poseidon. Thus the Rhodians traced their mythic descent from Rhodos and the Sun god Helios.Graves 1955. In the Odyssey (5.333 ff.), Leucothea makes a dramatic appearance and tells the shipwrecked Odysseus to discard his cloak and raft and offers him a veil (Œ∫œÅŒÆŒ¥ŒµŒºŒΩŒøŒΩ, kredemnon) to wind round himself to save his life and reach land. Homer makes her the transfiguration of Ino. In Laconia, she has a sanctuary, where she answers people's questions about dreams. This is her form of the oracle. Cultural allusions * Leucothea is mentioned by John Milton in the Paradise Lost scene where archangel Michael descends to Adam and Eve to declare that they must no longer abide in Paradise (second edition, 1674, book XI, lines 133-135): {| | : \\"Meanwhile, To re-salute the world with sacred light, Leucothea waked;. . .John Milton, The English Poems (Wordsworth Poetry Library, 2004). |} * Leucothea is mentioned by Robert Graves in The White Goddess. * In Ezra Pound's Cantos, she is one of the goddess figures who comes to the poet's aid in Section: Rock-Drill (Cantos 85‚Äì95).

The plot follows a surgeon whose growing obsession with a woman leads him to amputate her limbs and hold her captive in his home after she suffers a car accident. The film garnered notoriety prior to its release after protracted legal battles with Madonna and Kim Basinger, both of whom backed out of the leading role of Helena. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1993, where it received critical praise. After receiving an NC-17 rating by the MPAA, the film was given an R-rating on appeal and released in the United States in September 1993, but received critical backlash and was a financial failure. Plot Nick Cavanaugh is a lonely Atlanta surgeon obsessed with a woman named Helena, whom he had one intimate experience with. Nick is in love with her while Helena holds disdain for him. After she suffers a high grade tibial fracture in a hit-and-run motor vehicle accident in front of his home, he kidnaps and treats her in his house surreptitiously, amputating both of her legs above the knee. Later, he amputates her arms above the elbow after she tries to choke him. Though Helena is the victim of Nick's kidnapping and mutilation, she dominates the dialogue with her constant ridiculing of him for all of his shortcomings. Then it turns out that all this was a dream. Helena wakes up in the hospital, with all her limbs intact.

Williams as Sam the Clerk Production Producer Philippe Caland initially came up with the idea, but wanted a woman to write it, and so approached Lynch after she gave a poetry reading. At first Lynch didn't take to the concept, reportedly telling him \\"Well, that sounds kind of terrible.\\" However Caland was eventually able to convince her to work on it. In writing Lynch was inspired by some elements from her own childhood, stating to Vice that her being born with club feet, and her grandmother owning a Venus De Milo replica, influenced her insight into the characters, explaining: > It always struck me the way people looked at the Venus. They didn‚Äôt see her > as broken, they saw her as beautiful. And it really made a huge impact on > me. I thought I was broken and that maybe someday someone would find me > beautiful. So this idea of a damaged boy who was in an obsessive situation > who would try to recreate from his own view the one thing that didn‚Äôt hit > him or abandon him was this armless, beautiful woman. And therefore in a > dream recreate this obsessive thing where we take from one another until we > are the size and shape that we think the other person should be for us. Madonna was originally supposed to play the starring role, but shortly before filming was to begin in January 1991 she dropped out, causing the production on the film to be halted. The next month, in an attempt to salvage the situation, Lynch met with Kim Basinger about starring in the title role and while she agreed, closer to the new filming date she began requesting what The New York Times referred to as \\"major script revisions\\", which according to producer Mazzocone amounted to making Helena \\"less of a bitch\\". After the production failed to make the changes to Basinger's satisfaction she also quit the picture. Legal battles involving both stars then ensued. Eventually Basinger was the subject of an adverse jury verdict for over $8.1 million. This caused Basinger to enter bankruptcy. The verdict was then set aside on appeal in 1994, but the actress later settled for $3.8 million. Meanwhile, Sherilyn Fenn, who had previously worked with Lynch's father on Twin Peaks, was chosen for the title role of Helena in December 1991. By this time a third major star, Ed Harris, had also backed out of the film due to the ever- increasing delays, telling The New York Times, \\"I needed to get on with my life.\\" =Music= The score heard during the scene where Helena showers in a fountain, while a party crowd watches, was originally composed by Graeme Revell and based on the \\"Love Theme\\" used sparsely elsewhere in the film, with vocals by Bobbi Page. At the producers' request, \\"The Fountain Song\\", written and performed by Wendy Levy, replaced Revell's score in the DVD and subsequent releases. Release Boxing Helena premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1993 and was theatrically released by Orion Classics in the United States on September 3, 1993, Entertainment Film Distributors in the United Kingdom on June 18, 1993, and Republic Pictures in other international territories. =Box office= The film performed poorly at the box office, grossing only $1,796,389 in the domestic box office. =Critical reception= The film received negative reviews from critics upon release and was widely considered to be of poor quality, despite garnering praise at Sundance. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 17% score based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 3.68/10. Metacritic reports a 26 out of 100 rating based on 14 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel was one of the few positive notices, giving the film three out of four stars. John Simon of the National Review called Boxing Helena \\"the rottenest apple from the bottom of the cinematic barrell\\". =Accolades= The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival. Lynch won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director at the 14th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1994. References in Pop Culture The film was referenced in the television series Gilmore Girls (S3:E7 ‚ÄúThey Shoot Gilmores, Don‚Äôt They?‚Äù). The film also inspired the song \\"Helena\\" by The Misfits from their album Famous Monsters. The title of the film was used as the name of an episode of the sixth season of the The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, when Will Smith's character takes boxing lessons from an attractive instructor named Helena.

Ctesias (; , Ktƒìs√≠ƒÅs, 5th century BC), also known as Ctesias the Cnidian or Ctesias of Cnidus, was a Greek physician and historian from the town of Cnidus in Caria, when Caria was part of the Achaemenid Empire. Historical events Ctesias was on the Achaemenid side, attending to Artaxerxes II, at the Battle of Cunaxa (401 BC), Jean Adrien Guignet Ctesias, who lived in the fifth century BC, was physician to the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II, whom he accompanied in 401 BC on his expedition against his brother Cyrus the Younger. Ctesias was part of the entourage of King Artaxerxes at the Battle of Cunaxa (401 BC) against Cyrus the Younger and his Greek mercenaries called the Ten Thousand, and brought medical assistance to the king by treating his flesh wound.\\"The first certain event related to Ctesias is his medical assistance to the king during the battle of Cunaxa and his treatment of his flesh wound (Plut. Art. 11.3) in 401 BCE\\" in He reportedly was involved in negotiations with the Greeks after the battle, and also helped their Spartan general Clearchus before his execution at the royal court at Babylon. Ctesias was the author of treatises on rivers, and on the Persian revenues, of an account of India entitled Indica (·º∏ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ¨), and of a history of Assyria and Persia in 23 books, called Persica (Œ†ŒµœÅœÉŒπŒ∫Œ¨), written in opposition to Herodotus in the Ionic dialect, and professedly founded on the Persian Royal Archives.  Persica  The first six books covered the history of Assyria and Babylon to the foundation of the Persian empire; the remaining 17 went down to 398 BC. Of the two histories, abridgments by Photius and fragments are preserved in Athenaeus, Plutarch, Nicolaus of Damascus, and especially Diodorus Siculus, whose second book is mainly from Ctesias. As to the worth of the Persica, much controversy occurred, both in ancient and modern times. Although many ancient authorities valued it highly, and used it to discredit Herodotus, a modern author writes, \\"(Ctesias's) unreliability makes Herodotus seem a model of accuracy.\\"Burn A.R.

The satirist Lucian thought so little of Ctesias' historical reliability that in his satirical True Story he places Ctesias on the island where the evil were punished. Lucian wrote, \\"The people who suffered the greatest torment were those who had told lies when they were alive and written mendacious histories; among them were Ctesias of Cnidus, Herodotus, and many others.\\"Lucian, A True Story, 2.31 According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Ctesias mentioned that Darius I's grave at Persepolis was in a cliff face that could be reached with an apparatus of ropes.

The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1911) mentioned an Aegea, queen of the Amazons, as an alternative eponym of the Aegean Sea. Legend says she commanded an army of Amazon women warriors that traveled from Libya to Asia Minor to fight at Troy, and that she perished at sea with her army. Modern Italian has the adjective Egea (\\"Aegean\\"), but Classical Latin had none. Modern botanical Latin sometimes uses the specific epithet aegea to mean \\"of the Aegean\\".
