The game was released for Microsoft Windows in January 2007, and was later ported to OS X by Virtual Programming in November 2007. The player controls a nation and handles matters concerning war, diplomacy, trade, and economy. The original game without expansions starts in 1453, right after the Fall of Constantinople, and continues to 1789, just past the beginning of the French Revolution. The expansion Napoleon's Ambition extends the end game year forward to 1821, whereas the expansion In Nomine moves the starting year back to 1399, making it the longest as far as gameplay time in the series thus far. Europa Universalis III was the first to use Paradox's new 3D engine, Clausewitz Engine, that required user systems to meet the Pixel Shader 2.0 specification. The map has 1,700 land and sea provinces encompassing most of the world, with 250 playable historical nations. The game also uses elements of other Paradox games such as Crusader Kings, Victoria, and Hearts of Iron II. Gameplay Players begin the game by choosing what date they would like to start their campaign and which country they would like to play as. Once in game, players can shape their countries in many different ways. Forms of government include various kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and tribal governments. Players can influence a nation's society and values by adjusting \\"sliders\\" such as free trade/mercantilism, and may hire court advisors such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. As the game advances, players can pick \\"national ideas\\" such as Libert√©, √âgalit√©, Fraternit√©, which give specialized bonuses. The game has over 300 playable countries, including giants like Ming China, regional powers like Bohemia and Kazan, and tiny nations like the Maldives. Without formal victory conditions, players sometimes set goals for themselves like raising a minor city-state to world prominence. The world map includes some 1,700 provinces and sea zones. Many provinces in the Americas, Africa, and Oceania are not owned by any country, allowing for colonization. Economics in the early modern era is simulated by taxes and production income from provinces, as well as trade. National merchants compete in \\"centers of trade\\" such as Venice and L√ºbeck, and nations focused on trading income (e.g., Holland) enjoy significant advantages. Nations which mint too much currency, or are over- reliant on gold mining, are penalized by inflation. Technology investment is important in the long run; the game does not use a Civ-style tech tree, but instead has several different technology categories, which unlock new military units and buildings. Diplomacy is rather detailed: royal marriages, insults, alliances, trade embargoes, and so on all affect relations between countries. Players are able to gain control over other countries peacefully through personal unions and vassalage. Early international institutions such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Papal Curia and with the Divine Wind expansion the Shogunate are simulated in some depth. Every country has its own culture and religion, a frequent source of diplomatic unity or friction. Rulers have control over armies, navies, and mercenaries they recruit. Combat is abstract, with no direct control over battles (contrast the Total War games). Military tradition is necessary for recruiting good generals and admirals. Aggression (seizing provinces without a rightful claim) is checked by the \\"badboy\\" system of international infamy common to Paradox's games. The game is historically detailed; one can play the \\"grand campaign\\" starting in 1453 or 1399, but any date before the French Revolution (1821 with the Napoleon's Ambition expansion) is a valid starting point as well, with historical leaders and countries appropriately updated. Major events such as the War of the League of Cambrai are playable this way. Often the game diverges from reality after some time in-game, with unhistorical events such as Portugal colonizing North America, or Poland-Lithuania surviving to bully its neighbors. The game may be played single-player or multiplayer, with players controlling different countries; every non-human country is controlled by its own AI. Development=Expansion packs Paradox has released 4 expansion packs for EU3; each one requires all the previous expansions. One version of the game, Europa Universalis III Complete, includes the original game and the first two expansions. Another version, Europa Universalis III Chronicles, includes the original game and all four expansions. =Napoleon's Ambition= On 3 May 2007, an expansion named Napoleon's Ambition was announced by Paradox. It was officially released on 22 August 2007 via GamersGate, a digital distribution platform. The Windows version of the expansion is available as a download from GamersGate or as part of the Europa Universalis III Complete retail package, and aims to expand on EUIII with an improved interface, an enhanced trade system, expanded options, and the inclusion of more content to cover the extended time period. Virtual Programming published the Napoleon's Ambition expansion pack for Mac OS X on 7 December 2007. =In Nomine= On 5 March 2008, a second expansion titled In Nomine was announced. It was officially released on 28 May that same year. Features include: a further extension of the game's time frame, the addition of the Byzantine Empire, a revised AI which focuses on strategic top-level goals, and completely reworked rebels with their own goals and abilities. Virtual Programming published the In Nomine expansion for Mac OS X on 18 August 2008. The game now starts earlier, beginning in October 1399 after the coronation of Henry IV of England. Because the game's time frame has been extended by 54 years, it now includes nations such as the Byzantine Empire and the Jalayirids, leaders like Tamerlane, and events such as the end of the Hundred Years' War. A key variation of the expansion is the ability for the player to make important decisions that will shape the future of their country. For instance, a player can choose to create the United Kingdom, make Paris \\"worth a Mass\\", or institute an East Indian Trade Company. They can now implement decisions on both country and province level with the new decision system, including hundreds of different decisions depending on situation (for example, the current state religion) and country. In Nomine also features 'rebels with a cause'. There are several types of rebels (Religious, Patriotic, Peasant...), with different goals and different abilities. For example, if patriotic rebels take control of a province, that province will suffer from 10 more years of nationalism and is more likely to defect. Other rebels include colonial rebels in your colonies determined to get representation or independence and reactionary nobles rising up to put the serfs back in their place. You can now choose between crushing rebels using military force, negotiating with them, or leaving them and watching them enforce their demands on your country. Both Napoleon's Ambition and In Nomine are included in Europa Universalis III Complete. =Heir to the Throne= On 19 August 2009, a third expansion titled Heir to the Throne was announced. It was released for Windows on 15 December 2009 and includes many features requested by members of the forum. As the title suggests, it is focused mostly on royal family dynamics. Virtual Programming published the Mac OS X expansion on 24 May 2010. =Divine Wind= On May 27, 2010, a poll was created on the Paradox forums by a developer in which users could vote for a new expansion. Options included expansions to Europa Universalis III, Europa Universalis: Rome, Hearts of Iron 3 and Victoria. With 46% of the votes, the poll was won in favour of a Europa Universalis III expansion which is to focus on the rest of the world. On 9 September, Divine Wind expansion was announced. It requires Europa Universalis III Complete and the expansion Heir to the Throne in order to play. On November 30, the expansion became available for pre-order and was released on December 14, 2010. Divine Wind was published for Mac OS X by Virtual Programming on March 16, 2011. Compilation Released on March 22, 2011, Europa Universalis III: Chronicles bundled all four expansions with the original game. This was the first time Heir to the Throne and Divine Wind became available in retail. Europa Universalis III: Chronicles was published for Mac OS X by Virtual Programming on September 28, 2011. Mods Most of EU3's settings are in plain text files that are easily changed to modify the map, historical events, etc. Some popular mods extensively change the game, adding historical flavor, fantasy scenarios, or new game mechanics. Magna Mundi spinoff One mod for EU3 is Magna Mundi, which aims to add detail to the game's map and to steer the course of the alternate history portrayed by the game more towards real-world history by means of scripted events. A standalone version of Magna Mundi was planned as a spinoff game, to be developed by the mod's authors, operating as the development studio Universo Virtual, and to be published by Paradox. In 2012, MM was cancelled by Paradox, who cited lack of progress as well as a lack of trust in the developers as the reasons for this decision: according to a Paradox spokesman, \\"members within the MM team [...] report to us that the project lacks active leadership\\". Universo Virtual, claiming to had a game ready for release, announced legal action against Paradox. Its leader, Portuguese developer Carlos Gustavo, accused Paradox of having come up with new requirements several times during development of Magna Mundi. He also claimed that Paradox did not own the source code licensed to him, and announced a release of what was to be Magna Mundi the game, now re-titled World Stage. Sequel The game's sequel, Europa Universalis IV, was released on August 13, 2013.  Reception  Europa Universalis III received an 83% rating on Metacritic, indicating generally positive reviews. In a review for Eurogamer, Alec Meer gave the game a 7 out of 10, stating that it had ‚Äúnear unparalleled flexibility‚Äù and that it was ‚Äúcapable of inspiring immense self-satisfaction‚Äù, while also criticising the game for its obtuse mechanics, especially the ideas system. Nicholas Bale of Game Revolution also gave a positive review, calling it \\"rich strategic title with a bevy of options available\\".

He was executed during the reign of King Charles II for participating in the \\"Popish Plot\\" against the King. He is a Catholic martyr, and was beatified in 1929.http://saints.sqpn.com/saintw59.htm Early life Ireland was the eldest son of William Ireland of Crofton Hall, Yorkshire, by Barbara, a daughter of Ralph Eure, 3rd Baron Eure of Washingborough, Lincolnshire, by his first wife Mary Dawnay. He had several sisters, to whom he remained close, and who worked tirelessly to prove his innocence during the Plot. Ireland was educated at the English College, St. Omer; admitted to the Society of Jesus at Watten, 1655; professed, 1673; and was for several years confessor to the Poor Clares at Gravelines. Popish Plot In 1677, Ireland was sent on the English Mission and appointed procurator of the province. On the night of 28 September 1678, he was arrested by constables led by Titus Oates, the inventor of the Plot and taken before the Privy Council. Among those who shared his fate was John Grove, a layman and the nominal occupier of that part of Wild House, London, occupied by the Jesuits and the Spanish Embassy; also Thomas Jenison and John Fenwick. Together with Thomas Pickering, Ireland and Grove were said to have planned on 19 August, in the rooms of the Jesuit William Harcourt, to assassinate King Charles II at Newmarket. Oates and William Bedloe swore that Grove was to have ¬£1500 for the job and Pickering 30,000 Masses. The sworn testimony of Oates and Bedloe impressed the jury, and Chief Justice William Scroggs summed up against Ireland. Despite Ireland's impressive alibi, which was later to gravely embarrass the Crown, and much evidence of his accusers' bad reputation, produced by his sisters, he was found guilty.:s:Ireland, William (DNB00) After being confined in Newgate Prison, Ireland was sentenced to death on 17 December. Ireland wrote a journal in Newgate, which accounted for every day of his absence from London between 3 August and 14 September. It has been said that this account, which was supported by several credible witnesses such as Mrs Jane Harwell of Wolverhampton, in whose house he had stayed during the crucial period, gave the judges more trouble than any other single piece of evidence produced for the accused during the Plot Trials. The King having heard Ireland's alibi said that \\"he had no manner of satisfaction in the truth of the evidence (i.e. the evidence against Ireland), but rather of its falsehood.\\" However a servant girl called Sarah PaineKenyon, J. P The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.145 (of whom very little is known) swore that she saw Ireland in Fetter Lane on 20 August, and the judges ruled that this in itself disproved Ireland's alibi.Afterwards she seems simply to have vanished: she was notably absent at Titus Oates's own trial for perjury in 1685, where her evidence would have been crucial for the defence: Kenyon p.291 Execution After two reprieves, during which the King and Privy Council examined Ireland's alibi at great length, Ireland and Grove were executed together at Tyburn, Grove saying: \\"We are innocent, we lose our lives wrongfully, we pray God to forgive them that are the causes of it.\\" The King, who had already stated privately that they were innocent, as a special act of clemency ordered that they be allowed to hang until they were dead, thus sparing them the usual horrors of drawing and quartering.Kenyon p.164 Aftermath A deposition against Ireland's alibi was subsequently published by Robert Jenison, and further charges were brought against Ireland in John Smith's Narrative containing a further Discovery of the Popish Plot of 1679. On the other hand, Oates's false evidence against Ireland was later considered to be of such importance as to form a separate indictment at his trial for perjury in 1685. This unusual step may reflect the strongly expressed private view of King Charles II (who died a few days before the trial started) that Ireland was innocent.Kenyon p.289 The Crown may well have had an uneasy conscience about the decision to reject Ireland's cast-iron alibi, which had troubled them enough to have it debated twice before the Privy Council,Kenyon p.155 and which was conclusive at Oates's trial, when he failed to produce his crucial countervailing witness, the elusive servant girl Sarah Paine.Kenyon p.291 References * ;Attribution Category:1636 births Category:1679 deaths Category:17th-century English Jesuits Category:English beatified people Category:People from Lincolnshire Category:Martyred Roman Catholic priests Category:Victims of the Popish Plot Category:17th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:17th-century venerated Christians Category:People executed at Tyburn Category:One Hundred and Seven Martyrs of England and Wales ","title":"William Ireland (Jesuit)"},{"id":"4116739","text":"Tomarza is a town and district of Kayseri Province in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey.

Tortum was a part of Armenian Ayrarat Kingdom (4th - 3rd centuries BC), Kingdom of Greater Armenia (2nd century BC - 5th century) and Bagratid Armenia (9th - 11th centuries). Between the 13th and 17th century it was part of the Georgian principality of Samtskhe-Saatabago. It was first an Ottoman vassal in the early 16th century and was annexed in 1550. The area of Tortum was contested by the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire in the 16th-17th century but remained Ottoman after 1625. Armenians made up the vast majority of the population in Tortum. During Georgian rule, half of the ethnic Armenian population became Chalcedonians and joined the Georgian Orthodox church, while the rest of the Armenians remained part of the Armenian church. Armenian cleric Hakop Karnetsi recorded in the 1650s that a man named Mullah Jaffar took census and placed heavy taxes in the region, causing the Armenian Chalcedonians to convert en-masse to Islam.Tortum was a sanjak in Erzurum Eyalet. The region was in the early Ottoman period largely Christian but acquired a Muslim majority in the mid 18th century. During World War I, Ottoman troops crossed Tortum in the disastrous Battle of Sarikamish. Then the Russians occupied the town and held it between 1915 and 1917. After the February revolution of 1917 they left it to the Armenians. The Ottoman army advanced some time later and captured Tortum on 16 March 1918. The town has a ruined citadel.

She was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for West Renfrewshire constituency from the 1999 Scottish Parliament election until her retirement in 2011. Background The daughter of Martin Leonard and Cathie Craig, Godman was a Glasgow City councillor before entering the Scottish Parliament. She originally worked as a social worker working in the East End of Glasgow from 1979‚Äì89. After leaving St Gerard's Senior Secondary School, Glasgow aged 15, Godman worked with a charity for some time, as a waitress, in a bar, insurance collector and a house mother in a list 'D' school. She later attended Jordanhill College where she trained as a social worker. From 2003 until 2011, Godman was a Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. In 2008, it was revealed she charged the taxpayer around ¬£30,000 for hotel bills although she was renting a flat from her son Gary Mulgrew. She did not qualify for the rental expenses allowance as her main residence in Glasgow was too close to Holyrood to qualify, but claimed rent rather than hotel expenses. She was entitled to an overnight expenses allowance that permitted MSPs to recoup expenses for each night, which she had paid for the rent of the apartment. It was confirmed that she had neither broken the Parliamentary rules, nor benefited in any way. Personal life Godman's husband was Norman Godman, who was a Member of Parliament for Greenock and Inverclyde and its predecessor seat from 1983 to 2001. She had three sons. One, Gary Mulgrew, was one of the NatWest Three. Her experience with his extradition inspired her to take an active role in opposing Gary McKinnon's extradition to the United States in a similar case. Godman died on 21 July 2019 in Clydebank, after a long illness.

Biochemistry A1 receptors are implicated in sleep promotion by inhibiting wake-promoting cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. A1 receptors are also present in smooth muscle throughout the vascular system. The adenosine A1 receptor has been found to be ubiquitous throughout the entire body. Signaling Activation of the adenosine A1 receptor by an agonist causes binding of Gi1/2/3 or Go protein. Binding of Gi1/2/3 causes an inhibition of adenylate cyclase and, therefore, a decrease in the cAMP concentration. An increase of the inositol triphosphate/diacylglycerol concentration is caused by an activation of phospholipase C, whereas the elevated levels of arachidonic acid are mediated by DAG lipase, which cleaves DAG to form arachidonic acid. Several types of potassium channels are activated but N-, P-, and Q-type calcium channels are inhibited. Mechanism This receptor has an inhibitory function on most of the tissues in which it rests. In the brain, it slows metabolic activity by a combination of actions. At the neuron's synapse, it reduces synaptic vesicle release. Ligands Caffeine, as well as theophylline, has been found to antagonize both A1 and A2A receptors in the brain.

Stimulation of the A1 receptor has a myocardial depressant effect by decreasing the conduction of electrical impulses and suppressing pacemaker cell function, resulting in a decrease in heart rate. This makes adenosine a useful medication for treating and diagnosing tachyarrhythmias, or excessively fast heart rates. This effect on the A1 receptor also explains why there is a brief moment of cardiac standstill when adenosine is administered as a rapid IV push during cardiac resuscitation. The rapid infusion causes a momentary myocardial stunning effect. In normal physiological states, this serves as protective mechanisms. However, in altered cardiac function, such as hypoperfusion caused by hypotension, heart attack or cardiac arrest caused by nonperfusing bradycardias, adenosine has a negative effect on physiological functioning by preventing necessary compensatory increases in heart rate and blood pressure that attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion. In neonatal medicine Adenosine antagonists are widely used in neonatal medicine; Because a reduction in A1 expression appears to prevent hypoxia-induced ventriculomegaly and loss of white matter, the pharmacological blockade of A1 may have clinical utility. Theophylline and caffeine are nonselective adenosine antagonists that are used to stimulate respiration in premature infants. However, we are unaware of clinical studies that have examined the incidence of periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) as related to neonatal caffeine use. Caffeine may reduce cerebral blood flow in premature infants, it is presumed by blocking vascular A2 ARs. Thus, it may prove more advantageous to use selective A1 antagonists to help reduce adenosine-induced brain injury.

It has been bounded economically to Kayseri, 178 km far. Its neighbors are Sarƒ±z from North, G√∂ksun from east, Saimbeyli from south, Develi from south-west and Tomarza from west. Tufanbeyli is reached by crossing one of three high mountain passes. It's a struggle to reach but the views are incredible. The river G√∂ksu, a tributary of the Seyhan runs across the plateau. The climate is hot dry summers and cold winters. The mountains are forested but these are steadily being consumed by the local people. History During the Bronze Age, the area was part of the kingdom of Kizzuwatna. In classical antiquity, the region of Tufanbeyli was in the southwestern corner of Cappadocia (while the parts of the Adana region south of Tufanbeyli were in Cilicia). The city of Comana was situated near ≈ûark√∂y, some kilometers north of Tufanbeyli. The area is now settled by descendants of Turks from the Caucasus and the Av≈üar (Afshar tribe; the former having come to Anatolia as a result of the Russian influx into the Caucasus in the 18th and 19th centuries. The latter being one of the group of Turkish migrants from Asia that have preserved their clan identity in Anatolia. The Av≈üar played a key role in the Turkish conquest of the √áukurova region and remained a local authority right up until the 19th century, especially in mountain strongholds like Tufanbeyli. Its former names were H√∂ket√ße before 1923 and Maƒüara between 1923‚Äì1967. It became a district in 1958 by separating from Saimbeyli.

In 1965 he graduated with a BA from Nebraska Wesleyan University, where he would later teach, and earned an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1973. Before becoming a writer, Haruf worked in a variety of places, including a chicken farm in Colorado, a construction site in Wyoming, a rehabilitation hospital in Denver, a hospital in Phoenix, a presidential library in Iowa, an alternative high school in Wisconsin, and colleges in Nebraska and Illinois and as an English teacher with the Peace Corps in Turkey. He lived with his wife, Cathy, in Salida, Colorado, until his death in 2014. He had three daughters from his first marriage. All of Haruf's novels take place in the fictional town of Holt, in eastern Colorado. Holt is based on Yuma, Colorado, one of Haruf's residences in the early 1980s. His first novel, The Tie That Binds (1984), received a Whiting Award and a special Hemingway Foundation/PEN citation. Where You Once Belonged followed in 1990. A number of his short stories have appeared in literary magazines. Plainsong was published in 1999 and became a U.S. bestseller. Verlyn Klinkenborg called it \\"a novel so foursquare, so delicate and lovely, that it has the power to exalt the reader.\\"\\"The Sheltering Sky\\" New York Times review, October 10, 1999 Plainsong won the Mountains & Plains Booksellers Award and the Maria Thomas Award in Fiction and was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction.

According to 2009 census, its district population is 140,753; 115,930 live in the city itself. The district covers an area of at an elevation of . The district is the most populous after the provincial center of Manisa and the second most populous district center, in Turkey's Aegean Region. The name derives from the name of the Turkish clan of \\"Turgutlu\\" (also cited as \\"Turgut\\" or \\"Turgutoƒülu\\"), recorded as having provided the main support to the Beylik of Karaman during their time of existence and mentioned in historical records as an important political entity as late as the 18th century Iran. Their settlement in Turgutlu region is thought to have taken place some time in the 15th century at the same time as the Ottoman unification of Anatolia which resulted in the demise of Karamanids. That nearby Manisa was the center where Ottoman shahzades (crown princes) received their education must have placed the clan once again in a non-negligible position in their relations this time with the Ottoman dynasty. The city was alternatively called Kasaba (often spelled as Casaba or Cassaba in the 19th century Western sources also), which simply means \\"the town\\". People of Turgutlu still often use the term \\"Kasabalƒ±\\" to define themselves and despite the general signification of the word (Kasaba being \\"the town\\", Kasabalƒ± means \\"the townspeople\\"), people across Turkey usually understand when Turgutlu is being specifically referred to. The term Casaba for melons derived from the name of the city, an echo of its 18th-19th century past when it was an important regional trade center and hub, located in the middle of a fertile alluvial plain and with access to outside markets through nearby ƒ∞zmir. General features There are two townships with their own municipalities within the district (Urganlƒ± and Derbent) and 37 villages and nine village dependencies or hamlets. Turgutlu center has an annual population increase rate of 2,41 per cent and the district as a whole 1,8 per cent which places its region right after the central district of the province seat of Manisa. Turgutlu center is at a distance of only 31 km to Manisa, to which it depends administratively, and at a distance of 50 km to the international portuary center of ƒ∞zmir. Its closeness to these two metropolitan centers both of which have a deep and rooted history marked Turgutlu's destiny since its foundation in the 15th century. Today, the intense industrial activities in the even nearer ƒ∞zmir district of Kemalpa≈üa also find considerable repercussions in Turgutlu, which itself has a reputation of being one of the prominent centers of soil industry in Turkey. There are 44 primary schools and 14 schools providing intermediate education in Turgutlu district, bringing together 1,189 teachers and 28,767 students. There is also a higher professional school, a department of Celal Bayar University, at the district center. The state hospital at Turgutlu center has a bed capacity of 250, and there are also eleven health centers, all corresponding to a health professionals corpus of 370, 135 of whom are doctors. At fifty-six per cent, Turgutlu district has the highest proportion of agricultural lands across Manisa Province districts in its territory, while the forest lands covering a total area close to twenty thousand hectares, are also of considerable extent. Industry Reconstructed from scratch as of the 1920s, modern Turgutlu is, in addition to a productive agricultural sector, also an important industrial base structured under a Chamber of Industry founded in 1926. It is home to the production installations of Tuka≈ü, one of the most prominent producers of canned food (principally vegetables and fruits) in Turkey, as well as to BMC (Turkey), the Turkish branch of the motor vehicle giant BMC, active principally in commercial vehicles, trucks and buses. The town's industrial sector as a whole displays as high a degree of dynamism as its agricultural production, with many small- and medium-sized enterprises active in various fields. Also Seramiksan, one of the leading tile manufacturers of Turkey specialized in the production of ceramic wall and floor tiles, glazed and technical porcelain tiles, has their production installations in Turgutlu. Experimental mining of nickel laterites by using a heap leach process in Mount √áal near Turgutlu started in 2005 by a Turkish subsidiary of European Nickel PLC. The reserves are estimated to be 33 million tons of ore at 1.13% Nickel and 0.08% cobalt content. The planned development of a nickel mine and processing plant could deeply influence the district's economy with a potential to become one of the most important investments in Turkey's Aegean Region.

It acquired further importance once it became the first terminus of the 93 km. Smyrna Cassaba Railway whose construction was started from ƒ∞zmir in 1863 and which arrived in Kasaba in 1866. This railway was the third started within the territory of the Ottoman Empire at the time and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey.A short line built in Dobruja (now in Romania) was started and finished earlier, and ƒ∞zmir-Aydƒ±n railway was started earlier in 1856 but finished a year after Smyrna Cassaba Railway in 1867. Instead of being laid along the direct route eastwards from ƒ∞zmir to Turgutlu, about fifty kilometers in length, the line built drew a wide arc advancing first to the north-west from ƒ∞zmir, through its Kar≈üƒ±yaka suburb to whose foundation it contributed greatly, and curves eastwards only from Menemen on, crossing the former sanjak and the present-day province center of Manisa to join Turgutlu from the north. Belkahve Pass between Mount Nif and Mount Sipylus on the direct road from ƒ∞zmir and Turgutlu must have been judged too difficult for a track at the time. This railway was later extended further eastwards reaching a total length exceeding seven hundred kilometers but the operating company preserved the name Smyrna Cassaba. The first concession under the name was granted to a locally based English entrepreneur named Edward Price, who founded the company and built the line, and sold it in 1893 to the Franco- Belgian group Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which extended it. The line was nationalized in 1934 by the young Republic of Turkey in the frame of a general move started in the 1920s regarding Turkey's railways. The town was made into a kaza (district center) in 1868. During the final years of the Ottoman Empire, Kasaba was already a large town whose population well exceeded ten thousand people. During the 1910s, Kasaba was recorded by sources such as G. Sotiriadis (1918) and S. Anagiostopoulou (1997) as having a Greek population averaging at around one sixth of the total, between 3500 and 6000, in a subdistrict aggregate of thirty-five thousand and a center town population of around fourteen thousand.The relayer of the demographic data according to Greek sources, the researcher Georgios Nakratzas adds as a personal note that his own maternal family who were from Kasaba's Hamzabeyli village were at the origin economic migrants who had immigrated to Anatolia in the 1770s from Mani Peninsula in mainland Greece. Turgutlu during the Turkish War of Independence Turgutlu remained under Greek occupation between 29 May 1919 and 7 September 1922. The most bitter blow suffered by the town has been the fire started by the retreating Greek army on 5 September 1922, and which has lasted for two whole days, destroying 6127 buildings in a total of 6328, the historic Pasha Mosque, and the 20000 manuscript books preserved in the town library, as well as at the very least a thousand human lives (based on the corpses that could be counted). The survival of another historical monument, the Hacƒ± Zeynel Mosque and of the surrounding small agglomeration is locally still interpreted as divine intervention.James Loder Park, the U.S. Vice-Consul in ƒ∞stanbul at the time, who toured much of the devastated area immediately after the Greek evacuation, described the situation in the western Anatolian cities and towns he has seen, as follows: \\"Manisa...almost completely wiped out by fire (...). Cassaba (present day Turgutlu) was a town of 40,000 souls, 3,000 of whom were non-Moslems. Of these 37,000 Turks only 6,000 could be accounted for among the living, while 1,000 Turks were known to have been shot or burned to death. Of the 2,000 buildings that constituted the city, only 200 remained standing. Ample testimony was available to the effect that the city was systematically destroyed (...). Kerosene and gasoline were freely used to make the destruction more certain, rapid and complete. (...) The percentages of buildings destroyed in (...) Manisa [was] 90 percent, [in] Cassaba (Turgutlu) 90 percent, [in] Ala≈üehir 70 percent, [in] Salihli 65 percent. The burning of these cities was not desultory, nor intermittent, nor accidental, but well planned and thoroughly organized. (...) Without complete figures, (...) it may safely be surmised that 'atrocities' [consisting of murder, torture and rape] committed by retiring Greeks numbered well into thousands in the four cities under consideration.\\" According to a number of sources, the retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while fleeing from Anatolia during the final phase of the war.Sydney Nettleton Fisher, The Middle East: a history, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969, p. 386 According to a report of the Consul Park 90% of the buildings of the town were destroyed, as result of organized operations accompanied by several atrocities.U.S. Vice-Consul James Loder Park to Secretary of State, Smyrna, 11 April 1923.

It can be shown that the James‚ÄìStein estimator dominates the \\"ordinary\\" least squares approach, i.e., it has lower mean squared error. It is the best-known example of Stein's phenomenon. An earlier version of the estimator was developed by Charles Stein in 1956, and is sometimes referred to as Stein's estimator. The result was improved by Willard James and Charles Stein in 1961.  Setting  Suppose the vector \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta is the unknown mean of a m-variate normally distributed (with known covariance matrix \\\\sigma^2 I ) random variable {\\\\mathbf Y}: : {\\\\mathbf Y} \\\\sim N({\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}, \\\\sigma^2 I).\\\\, We are interested in obtaining an estimate \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} of \\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta, based on a single observation, {\\\\mathbf y} , of {\\\\mathbf Y} . This is an everyday situation in which a set of parameters is measured, and the measurements are corrupted by independent Gaussian noise. Since the noise has zero mean, it is very reasonable to use the measurements themselves as an estimate of the parameters. This is the approach of the least squares estimator, which is \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{LS} = {\\\\mathbf y}. As a result, there was considerable shock and disbelief when Stein demonstrated that, in terms of mean squared error \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left\\\\ {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}-\\\\widehat {\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta} \\\\right\\\\^2 \\\\right], this approach is suboptimal. The result became known as Stein's phenomenon.  The James‚ÄìStein estimator  MSE (R) of least squares estimator (ML) vs. James‚ÄìStein estimator (JS). The James‚ÄìStein estimator gives its best estimate when the norm of the actual parameter vector Œ∏ is near zero. If \\\\sigma^2 is known, the James‚ÄìStein estimator is given by : \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{JS} = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{(m-2) \\\\sigma^2}{\\\\{\\\\mathbf y}\\\\^2} \\\\right) {\\\\mathbf y}. James and Stein showed that the above estimator dominates \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{LS} for any m \\\\ge 3, meaning that the James‚ÄìStein estimator always achieves lower mean squared error (MSE) than the maximum likelihood estimator. By definition, this makes the least squares estimator inadmissible when m \\\\ge 3. Notice that if (m-2) \\\\sigma^2<\\\\{\\\\mathbf y}\\\\^2 then this estimator simply takes the natural estimator \\\\mathbf y and shrinks it towards the origin 0. In fact this is not the only direction of shrinkage that works. Let ŒΩ be an arbitrary fixed vector of length m. Then there exists an estimator of the James-Stein type that shrinks toward ŒΩ, namely : \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{JS} = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{(m-2) \\\\sigma^2}{\\\\{\\\\mathbf y} - {\\\\boldsymbol u}\\\\^2} \\\\right) ({\\\\mathbf y}-{\\\\boldsymbol u}) + {\\\\boldsymbol u}, \\\\qquad m\\\\ge 3. The James‚ÄìStein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ŒΩ. A natural question to ask is whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ŒΩ. The answer is no. The improvement is small if \\\\{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\theta - \\\\boldsymbol u}\\\\ is large. Thus to get a very great improvement some knowledge of the location of Œ∏ is necessary. Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. But we may have some guess as to what the mean vector is. This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.  Interpretation  Seeing the James‚ÄìStein estimator as an empirical Bayes method gives some intuition to this result: One assumes that Œ∏ itself is a random variable with prior distribution \\\\sim N(0, A), where A is estimated from the data itself. Estimating A only gives an advantage compared to the maximum-likelihood estimator when the dimension m is large enough; hence it does not work for m\\\\leq 2. The James‚ÄìStein estimator is a member of a class of Bayesian estimators that dominate the maximum-likelihood estimator. A consequence of the above discussion is the following counterintuitive result: When three or more unrelated parameters are measured, their total MSE can be reduced by using a combined estimator such as the James‚ÄìStein estimator; whereas when each parameter is estimated separately, the least squares (LS) estimator is admissible. A quirky example would be estimating the speed of light, tea consumption in Taiwan, and hog weight in Montana, all together. The James‚ÄìStein estimator always improves upon the total MSE, i.e., the sum of the expected errors of each component. Therefore, the total MSE in measuring light speed, tea consumption, and hog weight would improve by using the James‚ÄìStein estimator. However, any particular component (such as the speed of light) would improve for some parameter values, and deteriorate for others. Thus, although the James‚ÄìStein estimator dominates the LS estimator when three or more parameters are estimated, any single component does not dominate the respective component of the LS estimator. The conclusion from this hypothetical example is that measurements should be combined if one is interested in minimizing their total MSE. For example, in a telecommunication setting, it is reasonable to combine channel tap measurements in a channel estimation scenario, as the goal is to minimize the total channel estimation error. Conversely, there could be objections to combining channel estimates of different users, since no user would want their channel estimate to deteriorate in order to improve the average network performance. The James‚ÄìStein estimator has also found use in fundamental quantum theory, where the estimator has been used to improve the theoretical bounds of the entropic uncertainty principle (a recent development of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) for more than three measurements.  Improvements  The basic James‚ÄìStein estimator has the peculiar property that for small values of \\\\{\\\\mathbf y} - {\\\\boldsymbol u} \\\\, the multiplier on {\\\\mathbf y} - {\\\\boldsymbol u} is actually negative. This can be easily remedied by replacing this multiplier by zero when it is negative. The resulting estimator is called the positive-part James‚ÄìStein estimator and is given by : \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{JS+} = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{(m-3) \\\\sigma^2}{\\\\{\\\\mathbf y} - {\\\\boldsymbol u}\\\\^2} \\\\right)^+ ({\\\\mathbf y}-{\\\\boldsymbol u}) + {\\\\boldsymbol u}, m \\\\ge 4. This estimator has a smaller risk than the basic James‚ÄìStein estimator. It follows that the basic James‚ÄìStein estimator is itself inadmissible. It turns out, however, that the positive-part estimator is also inadmissible. This follows from a general result which requires admissible estimators to be smooth.  Extensions  The James‚ÄìStein estimator may seem at first sight to be a result of some peculiarity of the problem setting. In fact, the estimator exemplifies a very wide-ranging effect; namely, the fact that the \\"ordinary\\" or least squares estimator is often inadmissible for simultaneous estimation of several parameters. This effect has been called Stein's phenomenon, and has been demonstrated for several different problem settings, some of which are briefly outlined below. * James and Stein demonstrated that the estimator presented above can still be used when the variance \\\\sigma^2 is unknown, by replacing it with the standard estimator of the variance, \\\\widehat{\\\\sigma}^2 = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum ( y_i-\\\\overline{y} )^2. The dominance result still holds under the same condition, namely, m > 2. * The results in this article are for the case when only a single observation vector y is available. For the more general case when n vectors are available, the results are similar: :: \\\\widehat{\\\\boldsymbol \\\\theta}_{JS} = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{(m-2) \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{n}}{\\\\{\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf y}}\\\\^2} \\\\right) {\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf y}}, :where {\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf y}} is the m-length average of the n observations. * The work of James and Stein has been extended to the case of a general measurement covariance matrix, i.e., where measurements may be statistically dependent and may have differing variances. A similar dominating estimator can be constructed, with a suitably generalized dominance condition. This can be used to construct a linear regression technique which outperforms the standard application of the LS estimator. * Stein's result has been extended to a wide class of distributions and loss functions. However, this theory provides only an existence result, in that explicit dominating estimators were not actually exhibited. It is quite difficult to obtain explicit estimators improving upon the usual estimator without specific restrictions on the underlying distributions.

MD 302 was extended west toward Church Hill in the late 1940s and to US 301 in the mid-1960s. Route description View east along MD 302 at US 301 in Queen Anne's County MD 302 begins at an intersection with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) about midway between Church Hill and Barclay in Queen Anne's County. County- maintained Hall Road heads west from the intersection toward Church Hill, and a park and ride lot is located in the northeast quadrant of the intersection. MD 302 heads east as two-lane undivided Barclay Road, which crosses Red Lion Branch near its source west of Stevens Corners. The highway passes through the town of Barclay as Church Street. In the center of town, the highway has an at-grade crossing with the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad just west of the route's junction with MD 313 (Goldsboro Road). MD 302 crosses Unicorn Branch at its source, and the highway begins to follow the Queen Anne's‚ÄìCaroline county line at its intersection with Woodyard Road. MD 302 passes through the town of Templeville, where the highway intersects the northern terminus of MD 454 (Crown Stone Road). East of the town, shortly after crossing Beaver Dam Ditch, MD 302 reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line. The highway continues east as DE 11 (Arthursville Road) toward Hartly. History The first section of MD 302 was about east from MD 313 in Barclay paved in 1923. A second, unconnected section was completed between Templeville and the Delaware state line in 1930. The gap between Barclay and Templeville was filled in 1939. MD 302 was extended west about toward Church Hill in 1949. The state highway reached its present length when it was extended to US 301 in 1966. Junction list MD 302 follows the Queen Anne's-Caroline county line from just west of Woodyard Road near Templeville to the Delaware state line. The county line portion is considered to be in Caroline County for maintenance purposes.

Biography Louis Benjamin Hanna was born in New Brighton, Pennsylvania. His parents, Jason R. and Margaret Hanna died when he was a small boy, leaving him to be raised by his aunts. Louis Hanna grew up and received his education in Massachusetts and New York. He came to the Dakota Territory in 1881 with his brother, Robert C. Hanna and began farming near what is now Hope, North Dakota. He was married on November 18, 1888, to Lottie L. Thatcher (1864-1933) and they had four children. Career He sold his land in 1882 and moved to Page where he began his career as a businessman. He started a retail lumber company, then expanded into grain handling. Soon he needed banking facilities, so he opened a private bank at Page. The bank became a state bank, then became the First National Bank of Page, with Hanna as the president. From 1895 to 1897, Hanna served in the North Dakota House of Representatives. Hanna moved to Fargo in 1899, serving as vice president of the First National Bank of Fargo. Hanna took on the North Dakota Senate from 1897 to 1901, and again from 1905 to 1909, representing the Fargo district this time. In 1908, Louis Hanna was elected to represent North Dakota in the United States House of Representatives where he served two terms, from 1909 to 1913. Without any lapse between positions, he became the eleventh Governor of North Dakota in 1913 beating Frank O. Hellstrom in the race. The four years in Bismarck as Governor of North Dakota were largely spent attacking the $300,000 debt inherited by Hanna upon assuming office. At the end of four years, the entire amount was paid off; in addition, the bonded debt of nearly one million dollars was reduced to $462,000. A teacher's retirement and insurance fund was created and an inheritance tax law was sanctioned. During Hanna's term the governor, his family, and a committee went to Norway. On July 4, 1914 at Christiania (Oslo), they presented the people of Norway with a statue of Abraham Lincoln. The statue, by North Dakota sculptor Paul Fjelde, is located in Frogner Park in Oslo. Legacy and death King Haakon VII decorated Gov. Hanna as a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav of the First Rank. Governor Hanna served as chairman of the Liberty Loan drives in 1917 and 1918. During World War I he served in France as a captain in the American Red Cross. He was cited as an officer of the French Legion of Honor by the French government. Hanna continued his business interests in agriculture, banking, and other enterprises until his retirement. In 1924, Louis Hanna handled presidential campaign of Calvin Coolidge in North Dakota. He died in 1948, aged 86, in Fargo, North Dakota.North Dakota Governors - Louis B.

He lived at Rome and received his Talmudic training not only in Rome but also in Germany where he was the pupil of Jacob of W√ºrzburg and possibly also of Abigdor Cohen of Vienna. Shibbolei haLeket He owes his reputation to his compilation of ritual law entitled Shibbolei haLeket (Ears of Gleaning). It is divided into 372 paragraphs, included in the following twelve sections, treating of the laws, regulations, and ceremonies relating to prayers, Sabbath, benedictions, new moon, Feast of Dedication, Purim, Passover, semi-holy days, fasts, New-year, Day of Atonement, and Sukkot. Appended to the work are several treatises and responsa on miscellaneous religious and legal matters, such as circumcision, mourning rites, tzitzit, shechita, inheritance, and interest. As the title indicates, and as the author never fails to point out, the material is not original but rather was culled from many older authorities, such as Halakot Gedolot, Sefer haPardes, Alfasi, Isaac ben Abba Mari, Zerahiah ha-Levi, Isaiah di Trani, etc. To these extracts from other authorities the work owes its vogue. The preface, written in a pure and vigorous Hebrew, is introduced by a short acrostic. But Zedekiah did not restrict himself to the mere work of a compiler. He systematized his material skillfully, gave it a concise as well as popular form, and judiciously discriminated between conflicting opinions and decisions, giving preference to those that seemed to him true. For this procedure he apologized modestly in his preface with an anecdote, in substantially the following terms: A philosopher, when asked how he dared to oppose the great men of the past, answered, \\"We fully acknowledge the greatness of our old authorities and the insignificance of ourselves. But we are in the position of pygmies that ride on the shoulders of giants. Pygmies though we are, we see farther than the giants when we use their knowledge and experience.\\" Additions to Shibbolei haLeket were made by Zedekiah himself in a work the title of which is no longer known: these additions also contain a large number of responsa. It is usually cited, however, as Issur va-Hetter (Things Forbidden and Allowed). A complete edition of Shibbolei haLeket was published by Solomon Buber in 1886 at Vilna. The editor wrote a comprehensive introduction to it, containing an analysis of the work. Abridgments were published much earlier: Venice (Daniel Bomberg), 1545; Dubnov, 1793; Salonica, 1795. Further, it was plagiarized and published in a condensed form under the title \\"Tanya,\\" or \\"Tanya Rabbati,\\" which went through four editions: Mantua, 1514; Cremona, 1565; Zolkiev, 1800; Szydlikov, 1836. A third abridgment entitled Ma'aseh ha-Geonim (The Work of Old Authorities) circulated in manuscript and is extant in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Anav was in correspondence with Avigdor Cohen, Meir of Rothenburg, and Abraham ben Joseph of Pesaro. Very often he mentions his senior contemporary, Isaiah di Trani (the Elder), to whose Bible commentary Anaw in 1297 wrote glosses.

Any real client with portfolio losses can therefore have their accounts flattered by this process. This cycling cannot continue indefinitely and so the investment firm itself ends up picking up the cost. As it is ultimately expensive there must be a strong incentive for the investment firm to pursue this activity on behalf of their clients.  Etymology  Tobashi () is Japanese for \\"flying away\\". It describes the practice where external investment firms typically sell or otherwise take loss-bearing investments off the books of one client company at their near-cost valuation to conceal investment losses from the clients' financial statements. In that sense, the losses are made to disappear, or 'fly away'.  Structure  The scheme often makes use of off-balance sheet financing or Special purpose vehicles with non-coterminous accounting periods. Assets and liabilities are transferred at fictitious valuations, in the hope that losses are deferred until the market recovers. There are no rules as to how frequently the assets are transferred, and because there is little transparency over the valuation, losses can grow at every sale.\\"Yamaichi chief gives Diet testimony on 'tobashi' trades\\". Japan Times 9 December 1997. Retrieved 8 November 2011 As the market rout in the 1990s was drawn out, simple loss deferrals would no longer be sufficient. Advisors would devise schemes where they would be compensated for holding on to their bad investments over time by other means, such as buying specially issued bonds or paying for non-existent services. During the Japanese stock market boom in the late 1980s, investment bankers persuaded many Japanese companies to raise capital by issuing bonds with warrants attached, although they did not require the funds for operational purposes. Clients were tempted by the potential returns the investment firms said they could generate on stock market investments. However, as stock values fell, companies were in a vicious circle where not only their investments soured, the debt remained after issued warrants expired, weakening the companies' capital base. In Japan, it is an offence under the Securities and Exchange Law for a brokerage itself to compensate the final client's losses. In 1991, it became a criminal offence for brokers to compensate clients for investments which had gone bad or to otherwise conceal their losses. In the late 1990s new accounting rules introduced required investment valuations to be mark-to-market, forcing losses or gains to be shown in the financial statements. Despite the tightening, a loophole involving intangible assets continued to be exploited: Japanese acquisition accounting rules allow companies to record M&A; fees on their deals as part of consideration, and goodwill on consolidation may be depreciated over 20 years.  Scandals  The Wall Street Journal reports that in 1992 alone, four securities firms were exposed in the local press for various tobashi scams; Cosmo Securities, Daiwa Securities, Yamatane Securities, and the former Maruman Securities all had more than one billion yen of losses that were concealed.Koh, Yoree (8 November 2011). \\"At Olympus, High Times, Dark Shadow\\". The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 8 November 2011  Yamaichi Securities  In January 1992, Yamaichi Securities executives resorted to such a tobashi scheme, setting up a separate company called Yamaichi Enterprise which opened an account at the Tokyo branch of Credit Suisse. Depositing ¬•200 billion in Japanese government bonds, the Yamaichi subsidiary then used the dummy companies to generate profits for clients while eventually absorbing losses of ¬•158.3 billion. A separate scheme using foreign currency bonds resulted in losses of ¬•106.5 billion being hidden in Yamaichi's Australian subsidiary. In August 1993, Japan's Ministry of Finance inspected 47 financial institutions for tobashi, all of whom denied the practice. In December the MoF asked for reports from all 289 brokers on tobashi activity.  Olympus scandal  In October 2011 amidst the controversial removal of the newly appointed chief executive officer, it was revealed that Olympus Corporation had been operating a tobashi scheme in which US$2 billion was said to have been siphoned off to cover bad investments made up to 20 years ago.Powell, Bill (9 November 2011) \\"Olympus Scandal: A Confession, but Still No Answers\\". TIME. Retrieved 10 November 2011 On 8 November 2011, in what The Wall Street Journal referred to as \\"one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in Japanese corporate history\\", the company admitted that the money had been used to cover losses on investments dating to the 1990s. and that it had adopted \\"inappropriate\\" accounting practice.

The highway runs from Spider Web Road near Centreville east to MD 312 in Bridgetown. MD 304 connects Centreville with U.S. Route 301 (US 301) and several small settlements in central Queen Anne's County and northern Caroline County, including Ruthsburg and Bridgetown. The first sections of modern MD 304 were improved in the 1910s, but much of the highway from Centreville to Ruthsburg was constructed from the mid-1930s to the early 1940s. The part of the highway west of Centreville was constructed as Maryland Route 606 and became part of MD 304 in 1950. Since the 1950s, the highway through Centreville has been municipally maintained. MD 304 was extended east to MD 405 and replaced that route to Bridgetown in the 1960s. The US 301 junction became a superstreet intersection in 2011 and a double-roundabout partial cloverleaf in 2017. Route description MD 304's western terminus, signed along Corsica Neck Road MD 304 begins at the intersection of Corsica Neck Road and Spider Web Road on the Corsica Neck peninsula west of Centreville. The highway heads east as two-lane undivided Corsica Neck Road past the historic home Lexon and crosses Earle Creek. MD 304 crosses the Old Mill Stream branch of the Corsica River to enter the town of Centreville, where most of the highway is municipally maintained. At the east end of the bridge, the route passes between the historic Captain's Houses and the Capt. John H. Ozmon Store in the former wharf area of Centreville. MD 304 follows Chesterfield Avenue through the Centreville Historic District. At the west end of downtown, the eastbound route continues seamlessly onto Water Street. While on the one-way eastbound street to the south of the Queen Anne's County Courthouse, the highway intersects MD 213, which follows the one-way pair of Liberty Street southbound and Commerce Street northbound. Westbound MD 304 traffic follows Broadway one block to the north to head toward the west end of town. East of Commerce Street, MD 304 becomes bidirectional again. The highway's name changes to Railroad Avenue at Tilghman Avenue and to Ruthsburg Road at Kidwell Avenue, where state maintenance resumes. MD 304 leaves the town of Centreville as it passes southwest of Queen Anne's County High School. The highway continues through a double-roundabout partial cloverleaf interchange with US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). MD 304 heads southeast toward Ruthsburg, where the highway meets the northern end of MD 481 (Damsontown Road). The route continues east past the historic Thomas House and Hawkins Pharsalia on either side of the road's bridge across German Branch. MD 304 meets the eastern end of MD 405 (Price Station Road) opposite the historic home Stratton. The highway crosses Mason Branch of Tuckahoe Creek into Caroline County, where it follows Bridgetown Road to its eastern terminus at MD 312 (Oakland Road) in Bridgetown. History The first two improved sections of what is now MD 304 were county-constructed highways built with state aid. Caroline County built the two-span reinforced concrete Mason Branch bridge and a shell road east through Bridgetown in 1914. Queen Anne's County paved Water Street as a concrete road from west of Commerce Street to the Centreville Branch of the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad and built a shell road from the railroad to about east of downtown between 1915 and 1921. The Maryland State Roads Commission extended the concrete road from Water Street west to Centreville Landing, the wharf serving the county seat, in 1924 and 1925. The state reconstructed the 1910s county-built shell road east from the railroad as a macadam road in two segments in 1934 and 1935. Another section was built east from the end of the macadam reconstruction starting in 1936, and another segment was constructed by 1938. The Maryland State Roads Commission extended MD 304 to MD 481 at Ruthsburg through a February 26, 1942, resolution after the county section west from Ruthsburg was improved to state standards. The portion of MD 304 east from the Centreville town limit was reconstructed between 1946 and 1948. A macadam road was built west from Centreville Landing along Corsica Neck in 1935, and a new bridge was built across the Old Mill Stream Branch of the Corsica River in 1936 and 1937. Corsica Neck Road was designated MD 606 until the MD 304 designation was extended west from Centreville Landing in 1950. Before that extension, the portions of MD 606 from its MD 304 junction west to the town limit and MD 304 itself in Centreville were resurfaced in 1949. On August 13, 1952, the town of Centreville agreed to municipally maintain Chesterfield Avenue and the portion of Water Street west of Liberty Street in exchange for the roads commission taking over maintenance of Liberty Street so that street could be the southbound direction of a US 213 one-way pair. After the state resurfaced the portion of Water Street east of Liberty Street and Railroad Avenue east to the town limit and reconstructed the intersection of Commerce and Water streets, the town agreed to take over the remainder of MD 304 in town through a June 26, 1958 agreement. View east along MD 304 at MD 481 in Ruthsburg The Maryland State Roads Commission brought the portion of MD 304 from MD 481 to MD 405 into the state highway system through a February 19, 1962, memorandum of action. MD 304 from the current MD 405 intersection to the county line had been brought into the state system as an extension of MD 405 in the same resolution that extended MD 304 to Ruthsburg in 1942. The state and Caroline County agreed to bring Bridgetown Road from the county line to MD 312 into the state system as an extension of MD 405 through an August 22, 1957, resolution. MD 304 replaced MD 405 from the MD 405 intersection to MD 312 in 1969. That same year and extending into 1970, the highway was reconstructed from the east town limit of Centreville to US 301. MD 304 was resurfaced with bituminous concrete from US 301 to MD 481 in 1972 and from MD 481 to Mason Branch in 1977. The 1930s Corsica River bridge was replaced with the current steel beam bridge between 1984 and 1986. Water Street from west of Liberty Street to Commerce Street was made one way in 1997 or 1998. MD 304A was designated along the portion of MD 304 east of US 301 when the superstreet intersection between the two highways was installed in 2011. The Maryland Department of Transportation built a dumbbell interchange to replace the superstreet intersection with US 301. The interchange project constructed a bridge carrying MD 304 over US 301. This interchange was the top transportation priority for Queen Anne's County for years and was pushed for by students at Queen Anne's County High School after a student at the school was killed in an accident at the intersection in 2010. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 23, 2014, with several Queen Anne's County commissioners and representatives from state government in attendance. The interchange opened to traffic on August 15, 2017. As a result of the construction of the interchange with US 301, MD 304A was once again combined with MD 304.

Therefore, teachers registered in the eTwinning action are enabled to form partnerships and develop collaborative, pedagogical school projects in any subject area with the sole requirements to employ ICT to develop their project and collaborate with teachers from other European countries (at least two teachers from two different European countries are needed). The primary workspace for the eTwinning action, is the eTwinning Portal (www.etwinning.net) and it is available in twenty-five languages.

Its main objectives complied with the decision by the Barcelona European Council in March 2002 to promote school twinning as an opportunity for all students to learn and practice ICT skills and to promote awareness of the multicultural European model of society. It is now a very successful component of the Erasmus+ program, the EU program for education, training, youth and sport. More than 13 000 schools were involved in eTwinning within its first year.Gilleran, A. (2006). Learning with eTwinning. Central Support Service for eTwinning, European Schoolnet, Rue de Tr√®ves 61, B-1040 Brussels Belgium, eun.org, published April 2006. http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/news/publications.htm In fall 2008, over 50 000 teachers and 4 000 projects have been registered, while a new eTwinning platform was launched. As of January 2018 over 70 000 projects are running in classrooms across Europe, the total number of registered teachers has increased dramatically to 550 000, and the number of registered schools has been 190 000 (numbers updated daily on www.etwinning.net). In early 2009 the eTwinning motto has changed from \\"School partnerships in Europe\\" to \\"The community for schools in Europe\\". Konstantinidis, A. (2012). Implementing Learning-Oriented Assessment in an eTwinning Online Course for Greek Teachers. MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 8(1), 45‚Äì62 Operation The main concept behind eTwinning is that schools are paired with another school elsewhere in Europe and they collaboratively develop a project, also known as eTwinning project. The two schools then communicate using the Internet (for example, by e-mail or video conferencing) to collaborate, share and learn from each other. eTwinning encourages and develops ICT skills as the main activities inherently use information technology. Being 'twinned' with a foreign school also encourages cross-cultural exchanges of knowledge, fosters students' intercultural awareness, and improves their communication skills. eTwinning projects last for any length of time ranging from only a week, to months, up to creating permanent relationships between schools. Schools (both primary and secondary) within the European Union member states can participate in the eTwinning project, in addition to schools from Turkey, Norway and Iceland. In contrast with other European programmes, such as the Comenius programme, all communication is held via the internet and therefore there is no need for grants. Along the same lines, face-to-face meetings between partners schools are not required, though they are not prohibited and some schools organise face-to-face meetings. European schoolnet has been granted the role of Central Support Service (CSS) at European level. eTwinning is also supported by a network of National Support Services (NSS). Participating countries Member States of the European Union are part of eTwinning: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Overseas territories and countries are also eligible. In addition, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Serbia and Turkey can also take part. Seven countries from the European neighbourhood ‚Äì Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, which are part of the Eastern Partnership and Tunisia and Jordan which are part of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EUROMED) are also part of eTwinning via the eTwinning Plus scheme (https://plus.etwinning.net).

The district center is located in the middle of the isthmus of a small peninsula which protrudes northwards in the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir and which carries the same name as the town (Urla Peninsula), but its urban tissue is comparatively loose and extends eastwards to touch the coast and to cover a wide area which also includes a large portion of the peninsula. Sizable parts in the municipal area, owned by absentee landlords, remain uninhabited or are very rural in aspect. The peninsular coastline present a number of compounds constituted by seasonal residences along the beaches and the coves and which are administratively divided between Urla center's municipal area or its depending villages. Urla district area's eastern end neighbors the westernmost district of the Greater Metropolitan Area of ƒ∞zmir, G√ºzelbah√ße, and urbanization is much denser across that part, contributing to the whole district's average urbanization rate of 75%. With ƒ∞zmir center (Konak) at a distance of only , an important part of Urla's population is composed of residents, often wealthy, who commute to the big city every day, access to and from ƒ∞zmir and √áe≈üme, an international center of tourism at a distance of from Urla, having been greatly facilitated by the building of a six-lane highway. Urla district nevertheless manages to preserve an overall outlook of a pleasant suburb and resort, and as it extends to the west along Karaburun Peninsula, where it borders on the districts of √áe≈üme and Karaburun, secondary residences built along the coast or large farms of the interior, as well as native villages, all bearing typical Aegean characteristics, increase in number. To the south, Urla district neighbors that of Seferihisar and the settlement pattern is thinner in that section, with even some empty land, although housing projects targeting ƒ∞zmir's professional classes start to show a rising interest for that section as well. In economic terms, agricultural products, and especially the fresh produce for the vast nearby market of ƒ∞zmir, occupy a prominent place in Urla's economy, with fish, poultry and flowers standing out. An international Artichoke Festival is celebrated since 2015 The name \\"Urla\\" is derived from the Greek ŒíŒøœÖœÅŒªŒ¨ (\\"Vourla\\") meaning marshlands and the town was cited as such in western sources until the 20th century. Bryela (Byzantine name meaning Woman of God i.e. Holy Maria) whereas it has been suggested that due to the transposition of vowels Bryela has become Vourla, meaning marshlands. Urla is where the ancient city of Klazomenai is located and its remains are much visited, while the name lives on in the unofficial appellation used in the region for part of the coastline of the district, \\"Kilizman\\" which is a still-used derivative of Klazomenai. (Former name of G√ºzelbah√ße). With literacy among the highest in Turkey at 97%, Urla is also home to ƒ∞zmir Institute of Technology. Urla prides itself for having raised two important men of letters, Giorgos Seferis and Necati Cumalƒ±. Administration Urla town center is made up by 23 officially constituted and delimited quarters. Among these, the neighborhoods located on the coastline, such as ƒ∞skele and Zeytinalanƒ± quarters, play a key role in the town's pace, especially as places of gathering. The district counts 14 villages. Since the building of the highway, the population increases at a regular rate of 4 per cent a year, although the district is still placed in the lower end of ranking of ƒ∞zmir's districts on the basis of their population. Economy { border=\\"2\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" align=right cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Enterprises in Urla 2007 - bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\" Services 592 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Industrial 16 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Commerce 1,200 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Exporters 4 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Agricultural 3,204 } Secondary and/or seasonal residences continue to play a key role in Urla's economy, as demonstrated by the high number of residences (26,000 in all for the district) as compared to its population. Although Urla is keen to upgrade its arguments as a tourism destination with a wider appeal, the number of beds available in its accommodation units remains rather modest at only 185. Urla's fish restaurants and other local specialties, notably a layered pastry called \\"katmer\\" is famous. Urla's name is also associated in Turkey with a particular breed of \\"okra\\", red in color, called \\"kƒ±nalƒ± bamya\\" in Turkish. While there are no large shopping malls in Urla, mid-size distributors and small commerces abound, especially in the coastal section of the district center. The total number of companies for the district as a whole was 1,812 in 2007. There are four banks operating through four branches in Urla. In 2006, the district realized exports reaching 524,068 US Dollars, mostly agricultural products with added value. Some marble and lime is quarried but the contribution of mining activities to the general economy of the district is low. The same can be said for industrial activities in general, which are almost exclusively based on agriculture or livestock. The three small industrial zones present in the district center since the 1990s, employing about 650 people, usually house enterprises focused on maintenance and reparation activities. { border=\\"2\\" style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" align=right cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" - bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\" Fruit&vegetable; production 2006 (tonnes) - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Olive (for olive oil) 14,205 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Tomato (for table consumption) 5,200 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Watermelon 4,300 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Gumbo (red) 3,700 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Olive (for table consumption) 3,700 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Tomato (for sauce) 2,600 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Artichoke 1,500 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Grape (for table consumption) 1,146 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Satsuma 852 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Cabbage 750 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Aubergine 600 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Watermelon 560 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Pepperoni 420 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Lettuce 340 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Broccoli 250 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Grape (for wine) 240 - bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\" Orange 135 - bgcolor=\\"#e5e5e5\\" Nectarine 105 } Agricultural production remains the determinant activity for much of the district. In the district's total agricultural area of 971.5 hectares, 21% of which is irrigable, 36% is accounted by olive orchards and 17% by vegetable gardens. There are about six hundred thousand olive trees across the district. Although fruits and vegetables in general, and citrus fruits, vineyards, decorative plants and flowers (especially chrysanthemum, hyacinth, narcissus and carnation) in particular, correspond for each only to 1 or 2 per cent of the total area used for agriculture, their added value for the district economy as a whole is significant. Agriculture based on greenhouse cultivation acquired an increasing importance in Urla in recent years, especially in the villages near the town center, as well in parts of the municipal area that are still open for agricultural production. Urla quarters of Zeytinalanƒ± and ƒ∞√ßmeler and the nearby village of Ku≈ü√ßular stand out with their greenhouses focused on vegetable production, and those in the villages of Bademler and √ñzbek on flowers, the total number of households engaged in greenhouse cultivation (both vegetables and decorative plants) being around 400 according to ƒ∞zmir Chamber of Commerce figures. The same source cites the figures for the number of commercial enterprises occupied with this branch of agricultural activity as 26, the total area reserved for greenhouse farming as being around 1,500 decares, with 91 varieties cultivated. In Urla there are to date no certified enterprises engaged in organic farming, a new form of agriculture in which a number of new ventures made a name in ƒ∞zmir city's eastern neighboring district of Kemalpa≈üa. 17 per cent of the district's land, although suitable for agriculture, is still unused currently. In livestock breeding, poultry stands well above other livestock, a population of around 2 million chicken and perhaps up to eighty thousand turkey having been estimated for the district. 25 poultry enterprises present in Urla operate as subcontractors on behalf of Turkey's national brands in the industry. The count for bovine and ovine animals in Urla range between 5 and 8 thousand and some small-scale apiculture is also done. 220 tonnes of fish was caught across Urla shoreline in 2007, principally sea bass, gilthead bream and red mullet, the fishing activities being organized around five cooperatives and catering Urla's fish restaurants or ƒ∞zmir's fish markets. Eleven fish farming enterprises are present in the coastal areas of four villages (Balƒ±klƒ±ova, G√ºlbah√ße, Uzunkuyu, Zeytinler). There are 6 stock farms (horse breeding and care) and two enterprises engaged in dog breeding and care in Urla. Education and Health There are 16 students for each teacher and 492 patients for each doctor in Urla. History=Limantepe Information on Urla region's pre-Hellenistic history is quite recent, based on the excavations in Limantepe pursued by an international team since 1979. Some researchers refer in its context to the possible most ancient regularly used port in the world. Klazomenai - Kilizman Urla was an important cultural centre also in its Hellenistic period. It was the site of the Ionian city of Klazomenai. Pieces of art and sculpture found during excavations are now exhibited in the Louvre or in ƒ∞zmir Archaeology Museum. The oldest attested olive oil production facilities were recently discovered in Klazomenai. The traces also indicate first exports of olive oil by way of sea. Olive oil extraction installation (i≈ülik) dating back to the third quarter of the 6th century BC uncovered in Klazomenai is the only surviving example of a level and weights press from an ancient Greek city and precedes by at least two centuries the next securely datable earliest presses found in Greece. It was restored and reconstructed in 2004-2005 through collaboration between Ege University, a Turkish olive-oil exporter and a German natural building components company, as well as by local artisans, on the basis of the clearly visible millstone with a cylindrical roller and three separation pits. The olive oil obtained turned out to be quite a success in business terms as well. Turkish era In the summit of Ottoman power, during the 16th century, Urla was almost entirely incorporated into the pious foundation established by Ay≈üe Hafsa Sultan for the revenues and the maintenance of the complex she had had built in Manisa in the 1520s. With the decline of the Ottoman power, the town, placed along with the entire peninsula at the frontier of the Aegean Sea difficult to control, frequently saw itself at the mercy of plunderers. ƒ∞zmir's rise as an international trade port partially relieved Urla from its security concerns, while it also gradually increased its dependency to the neighboring metropolis. A quarantine center was established in Urla in 1865 through French initiative, in the island opposite Urla quay that bears today the very name of Karantina, and where part of the site of ancient Klazomenai also extends. The center was in service until the 1950s, now transformed into a state hospital and an annexed summer camp, although the quarantine installations are still standing. Prior to the foundation of the quarantine center, Admiral Charles Napier had spent the winter of 1839-1840 here, before intervening, along with allied Turkish troops, against Muhammad Ali of Egypt in Lebanon. The town's population were mostly Greeks until the population exchange in the 1920s. Seferis and Cumalƒ± Urla had two important men of letters among his sons: It is the birthplace of the Greek poet and Nobel- laureate Giorgos Seferis and the Turkish novelist Necati Cumalƒ± (born in Florina and re-settled in the framework of the 1923 Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations) grew up in Urla.

In 2009 it had 74,806 inhabitants. Geography thumb √únye has a little port, in a bay on one of the flatter areas of the Black Sea coast. The climate is typical of the Black Sea region, warm and wet, although because the hinterland is flatter than most of the coastline √únye has less rainfall. Agriculture is the basis of the local economy, in particular hazelnut growing, hazelnut trading and hazelnut processing. The town is very quiet in late-July and August when most people are in the countryside for the hazelnut harvest. The town of √únye provides high schools, higher education and other services to the surrounding countryside, and other industry includes a large cement factory, flour mills, local handicrafts and the port. The town has grown in recent decades, acquiring the multi-storey concrete blocks spreading along the coast, typical of so many Turkish towns. There are cafes and internet cafes popular with students. The cuisine includes the local pizza called pide. With its quiet spots for picnics and walking and its excellent beaches √únye is one of the nicest holiday towns on the eastern Black Sea coast. Affordable pensions and camping facilities as well as 2- or 3-star hotels can be found in the summer season. There are summer festivals and concerts in July. Etymology The town's name has evolved from the Greek Oinoe through Oinaion, Unieh, Unie and Unia to the current √únye. History The history of √únye goes back to the Hittite period in the 15th century BC, followed by the Kashkas, Scythians, Milesians, Persians, Pontus and Ancient Roman/Byzantine eras. During Greco- Roman times, it was called Oenoe and was a port town of Pontus, at the mouth of the river Genius. It was also ruled by Danishmends between 1086-1098, 1141-1144 and 1150-1157, Sultanate of Rum between 1188-1204, 1214-1228 and 1230-1243, Empire of Trebizond in 1204-1214, 1228-1230, 1243-1297 and 1302-1346 and Emirate of Hacƒ±emiroƒülu between 1297-1302 and 1346-1461. During the 1290s, the √únye fortress was built by the Trebizond emperor Ioanni (II.).Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \\"Trabzon Imparatorlugu\\" 2016 () ; p.100 In the year 1806 the Laz attacked √únye.

Known for most of its length as Williamsburg Road, the state highway runs from MD 331 in Hurlock north to the end of state maintenance a short distance east of the intersection with MD 313 and MD 318 in Federalsburg. MD 307 was one of the first highways completed by the Maryland State Roads Commission when the Hurlock-Federalsburg Road was constructed in 1910. The highway was relocated between Williamsburg and Federalsburg in the 1960s. Route description View south along MD 307 at MD 313/MD 318 near Federalsburg MD 307 begins at a five- way intersection in the town of Hurlock. Oak Street is the west leg of the intersection, while Main Street, which is MD 331 to the south, forms the north and south legs of the intersection. MD 331 heads northwest on Academy Street. MD 307 heads east as two-lane undivided Broad Street through an industrial area after a grade crossing with a spur of the Seaford Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which the state highway begins to parallel closely as it leaves Hurlock. MD 307 continues northeast as Williamsburg Road through farmland. The state highway passes through the hamlet of Williamsburg and traverses Skinners Run before leaving the vicinity of the railroad. MD 307 enters Caroline County shortly before meeting MD 313 and MD 318 (Federalsburg Highway) at the four-leg Federalsburg Roundabout. MD 307 continues east into the town of Federalsburg and reaches its eastern terminus at Charles Street. Academy Avenue continues east as a municipal street toward downtown Federalsburg. History The segment of MD 307 between the town limits of Federalsburg and the Dorchester County line was the first section of state road placed under contract for construction by the Maryland State Roads Commission in June 1909. That section of road and the remainder of the highway southwest to Hurlock were completed in 1910. The portion of original highway between Williamsburg and just west of Federalsburg was bypassed in 1970; the old alignment is now Whitely Road. The Federalsburg Roundabout was constructed in 1998.

It also minted coins bearing the dates and effigies of Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, and Caracalla. Its bishop Paralius was at the Council of Ephesus (431) and sent his deacon Eucharius to represent him at the Council of Chalcedon (451). Paulus was one of the signatories of the letter by which the bishops of the Roman province of Helenopontus, to which Andrapa belonged, protested to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458 about the killing of Proterius of Alexandria.

In its original form, it was applied to an unramified double covering of a Riemann surface, and was used by F. Schottky and H. W. E. Jung in relation with the Schottky problem, as it is now called, of characterising Jacobian varieties among abelian varieties. It is said to have appeared first in the late work of Riemann, and was extensively studied by Wirtinger in 1895, including degenerate cases. Given a non-constant morphism :œÜ: C1 -> C2 of algebraic curves, write Ji for the Jacobian variety of Ci. Then from œÜ construct the corresponding morphism :œà: J1 -> J2, which can be defined on a divisor class D of degree zero by applying œÜ to each point of the divisor. This is a well-defined morphism, often called the norm homomorphism. Then the Prym variety of œÜ is the kernel of œà. To qualify that somewhat, to get an abelian variety, the connected component of the identity of the reduced scheme underlying the kernel may be intended. Or in other words take the largest abelian subvariety of J1 on which œà is trivial. The theory of Prym varieties was dormant for a long time, until revived by David Mumford around 1970. It now plays a substantial role in some contemporary theories, for example of the Kadomtsev‚ÄìPetviashvili equation. One advantage of the method is that it allows one to apply the theory of curves to the study of a wider class of abelian varieties than Jacobians. For example, principally polarized abelian varieties (p.p.a.v.'s) of dimension > 3 are not generally Jacobians, but all p.p.a.v.'s of dimension 5 or less are Prym varieties. It is for this reason that p.p.a.v.'s are fairly well understood up to dimension 5.

Isabelle Sprague-Smith, a former New York artist and school principal, was the president and driving force behind the Bach Festival from 1935 until her death in 1950. At Sprague-Smith's death, the future of the Bach Festival was uncertain. Rollins President Hugh F. McKean (husband to Jeannette Genius McKean) asked John M. Tiedtke, the treasurer of the College, to fulfill the obligation and he accepted. Tiedtke served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees until his death in December 2004.

Designed in an Orthodox Basilica plan, the church was constructed upon the foundations of the Temple of Apollo with masonry stone and brick. The cruciform shaped church consists of a nave with two rows of columns with three columns each, two aisles and an apse at one end. Its original wooden roof was replaced in the 12th and 13th centuries by a high dome. The building is vaulted around the dome, a different style that is normally not seen in Byzantian architecture. Remains of the city wall Vize Fortress () is a fortification constructed in the Ancient Roman era. It is situated at the northwest of the town. It is believed that the fortress was built originally in 72-76 B.C., and was revived during the Justinian I times. It is constructed of clear cut stones and rubble masonry upon foundations with stone blocks of and . The bluish color of the stones at the northern wall indicates that this section was rebuilt in the Late Byzantine era during the Palaeologian dynasty. The fortress consists of two nested walls. The western and southern city walls are intact. An inscription in Greek alphabet letters carved on stone, which was found at the fortress, says \\"Here were watchtowers built under the administration of Firmus, the son of Aulus Pores, along with Aulus Kenthes, the son of Rytes the son of Kenthes, and Rabdus, the son of Hyakinthus.\\" It is exhibited at Kƒ±rklareli Museum.

The show was a Hat Trick production for Yorkshire Television. The show was later repeated on Channel 4, The Children's Channel and Nickelodeon UK and was nominated for an RTS Award. It was created by the team behind the comic Oink! - Patrick Gallagher, Tony Husband and Mark Rodgers. The puppets, animation characters and main set were designed by Gallagher, who was also the show's graphic designer. The puppets were made by the team who made the puppets for Spitting Image. Round the Bend was a satirical parody of Saturday morning magazine shows ‚Äî with a host providing linking material between cartoons, music videos and news sections - albeit set in a sewer. The anarchic tone of the show and its parody cartoons was similar to that of Viz. The animated segments were created by Aardman Animations and Catalyst Pictures. The title of the show is a double entendre. Referring to a toilet U-bend, the opening titles began with the camera being flushed down a toilet and ending up in a sewer. It was also a popular saying at the time to describe someone who was insane. Regular cast * Doc Croc - The show's host and a temperamental, rude, and overbearing crocodile.

There was at one point a talking piece of furniture, the 'Armchair Critic'. Performed by Nigel Plaskitt and voiced by Jon Glover. * Luchetti Bruchetti - an Italian rat and the show's resident artist. Not as intelligent as the other rats, and usually the rat that Doc used to take most of his problems out on. Performed by Alistair Fullarton, later Simon Buckley and voiced by Jonathan Kydd. On occasion, the cast would be plagued by a shade- wearing teddy bear which, despite its diminutive size, would inflict great physical beatings to Doc Croc and the rest of the crew. The cast was also visited by the small teddy's (much larger) father. Parodies Other non- regular cast members were often satirical parodies of real people or existing TV shows, including: *A music video segment featuring: Michael Jackdung, Elton The John, Kylie Manure and Jason Dungovan - parodies (in name only) of Michael Jackson, Elton John, Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. Each was a hand puppet designed to look like a pile of manure, but with a mouth that would sing along to parodied versions of pop songs. In the case of Elton The John, the puppet was a singing toilet. *The news segment: John Potato's Newsround - a parody of John Craven's Newsround, but presented by a potato. The sports section was presented by David Colemole - a glove-puppet of a mole who wore round glasses and had a voice very similar to David Coleman. *Vegetables - a parody of Neighbours. All the parts were played by vegetables with Australian accents. *Wee-man and the Masters of the Looniverse - a cartoon parody of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. *Nursery Crimes - a cartoon parody of Jackanory. *Cosmic Comprehensive - a cartoon about a school of aliens. *Fairytales of the Unexpected - a cartoon parody of Tales of the Unexpected mixed with famous fairy tales including Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Rapunzel, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Little Red Riding Hood. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Toilets - a cartoon parody of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, using animated toilet characters, lampooning the turtles. *Teenage Mutant Ninja Teddies - another cartoon parody of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but using teddy bears. *Old Age Useless Nitwit Tortoises - yet another cartoon parody of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Their nemesis was Bottom Brain, a parody of Krang. *Attack of the Atomic Banana - a B movie/serial parody with a 50 ft. banana rampaging through New York City. King Kong made a cameo, and the \\"banana problem\\" was solved by a group of teenagers in a style similar to Scooby-Doo. This section was (fictionally) produced by Stubby Broccoli and Samuel J. Greengrocer, a play on the names of Cubby Broccoli and Samuel J. Briskin. These segments were made with stop-motion animation by Dave Alex Riddett (Aardman Animations). *Thunderpants - a parody of ThunderCats. *Transformaloids - a parody of Transformers, featuring Octopus Slime the octopus-headed transforming robot, who on at least one occasion went up against his arch enemy, Armadillotron. *Woolly The Wonder Sheep - a parody of both Champion, the Wonder Horse and heroic dog Rin Tin Tin and was voiced by Enn Reitel, impersonating Dustin Hoffman. *Botman - a parody of Batman, with the lead character having an abnormally huge bottom. Other segments Other segments included: *The Son of, The Return of, The Revenge of.... The False Teeth From Beyond The Stars. Another B-movie parody, featuring a character named Roger Prentice, the Apprentice Dentist. A crossover between the Atomic Banana ensued, entitled False Teeth From Beyond the Stars Meet the Atombanana. These segments were made with stop-motion animation by Dave Alex Riddett (Aardman Animations). *Pzycho the Magnificent - an animated section in which Pzycho would attempt to use magic for his own personal gain, but would get caught by the police every time. *The Oddbod Family - animated shorts, each week centred on a member of a family who all have abnormal abilities. *Tommy's Magic Time Trousers - an animation about a boy who can travel through time whenever he drops his trousers. Many trouser puns were used, such as in the time-travel sequence Tommy would say \\"The fly's the limit!\\", with the trousers replying \\"Brace yourself Tommy!!\\". The segment always ended with the trousers saying \\"If only he knew Tommy! If only he knew!\\". Merchandise Due to the popularity of the show, a computer game was created for the ZX Spectrum and was later ported to the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga and Acorn Archimedes. A preview of a sequel was also released but the sequel was never finished. In 1990, a one-off magazine special was also published entitled, \\"Round the Bend! TV Special\\".

The state highway originally continued through Marydel to the Delaware state line, but was rolled back in favor of MD 454 in the mid-1940s. Route description View north along MD 311 at MD 313 in Goldsboro MD 311 begins at an intersection with MD 313 (Oldtown Road) in the town of Goldsboro. The state highway, named Main Street, heads north as a two- lane undivided road, closely paralleling an unused rail line whose right-of- way is owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation that is situated east of the road. After intersecting MD 287 (Sandtown Road), MD 311 leaves the town of Goldsboro and the vicinity of the rail line and the highway's name changes to Henderson Road. The state highway crosses Broadway Branch before rejoining the rail line immediately before the intersection with River Bridge Road, where the highway enters the town of Henderson. After leaving Henderson, MD 311 veers away from the rail line and crosses Cold Spring Branch. The state highway passes through a mix of farms and forests as it approaches the town of Marydel. Within the town, the state highway becomes Halltown Road and intersects Main Street, which is unsigned MD 821, shortly before reaching its northern terminus at MD 454 (Crown Stone Road/Halltown Road). History MD 311 was constructed in its modern form in 1924. At the time, the state highway turned east onto Main Street in Marydel and followed it to the Delaware state line. By 1946, MD 311's northern terminus was rolled back to Main Street and MD 454 headed to the state line instead. MD 311 was widened along its entire length in 1952.

The headquarters of the bank is located in the capital city Baku. The National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established by Decree of President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Establishment of the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 11 February 1992. The National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan was renamed to ‚ÄúThe Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù upon enactment of the Referendum Act of the Republic of Azerbaijan on ‚ÄúMaking additions and amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù dated 18 March 2009. The status, goals, functions and authorities, as well as management and organizational structure of the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan, relations with public authorities and other persons as the central bank of the state are determined by the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚ÄúOn the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù dated 10 December 2004. The Central Bank‚Äôs exceptional function of issue of the national currency of the country is specified in the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Central Bank is also guided by other legislative acts of the Republic of Azerbaijan and international treaties seconded by the Republic of Azerbaijan. History The history of central banking in Azerbaijan covers the periods of: the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918‚Äì1920); the soviet socialist era (1920-1991); modern banking history since Azerbaijan regained independence in 1991. In the early 20th century, Azerbaijan declared its independence and established the Azerbaijan People‚Äôs Republic on 28 May 1918. Initially, Transcaucasian bonds were widely used in the independent republic along with Russian money and Baku bonds, issued to circulation by the Baku City Administration and the Municipal service of the Baku Soviet in January 1918 at the decision of the Baku Council of People‚Äôs Commissars. At the same time, the Baku branch of the former State Bank of Russia also continued its activity. The Government of the Azerbaijan People's Republic took a decision on the establishment of the Azerbaijan State Bank (central bank) on 7 March 1919. On 16 September of the same year, the Parliament of the Azerbaijan People's Republic adopted the Charter of the Azerbaijan State Bank and the Bank started functioning with the solemn opening ceremony on 30 September 1919. The ‚Äòbank of banks‚Äô, the Azerbaijan State Bank supervised existing credit institutions and issued monetary units. After the collapse of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on 28 April 1920, the Azerbaijan State Bank was renamed the Azerbaijan People‚Äôs Bank at the order of the Finance Commissariat of the new state structure ‚Äì the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on 31 May 1920. At the decision of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan dated 9 June 1920, all banks and other credit institutions were nationalized and subordinated to the People‚Äôs Bank. The banking business was under an exclusive monopoly of the state. The basic function of the Azerbaijan People‚Äôs Bank was to issue banknotes. The People‚Äôs Bank, which was a part of Finance Commissariat, financed the national economy and was engaged in budgeting and budgetary forecasting. The People‚Äôs Bank halted lending and became an institution serving budget operations along with financial bodies. A new economic policy of the end of 1921 necessitated restoration of the central bank. The Azerbaijan State Bank was established by the decision of the Council of People‚Äôs Commissars of Azerbaijan dated 16 October 1921 with parallel adoption of its Charter. The Federative Union of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was established on 12 March 1922. The TSSR was included to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on 30 December 1922. TSSR moved to a single monetary system at the Decree of the Board of Union of the TSSR of 10 January 1923, which terminated the emission activity of the Azerbaijan State Bank. By the decree of the Council of People‚Äôs Commissariat of Azerbaijan dated 3 July 1923 the Azerbaijan State Bank was renamed the Azerbaijan State Agricultural Bank and its central banking functions were terminated. Initially, the Azerbaijan State Agricultural Bank both assisted in the development of agriculture and regulated the money circulation and commodity turnover. The Baku Branch on the USSR State Bank was established in 1923. Under the Constitution of the USSR, adopted in December 1936, Azerbaijan became a part of the USSR as a ‚Äòsovereign‚Äô republic. The Azerbaijani Office of the USSR State Bank operated from that year to the end of 1991. Article 14 titled \\"The Banking system and money circulation\\" of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \\"On Grounds for Economic Independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" dated 25 May 1991, stipulated the legal basis for the independent banking system and circulation of the national currency in Azerbaijan, and determined the status and authorities of the National Bank. The National Bank was declared a supreme emission agency, that pursued the state policy in lending, money circulation, settlements and foreign exchange relations, regulating the overall performance of the banking system and discharging reserve bank functions. A National Bank was established in the Republic of Azerbaijan by Decree of President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on ‚ÄòEstablishment of the National Bank in the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äô dated 11 February 1992. The effective date of the Decree (12 February) is celebrated as the day of establishment of the Bank. The first law regulating activities of the National Bank ‚Äì the Law on the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted on 7 August 1992 and the Resolution on Approval of the Charter of the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan was passed by the Milli Mejlis (National Parliament) of the Republic of Azerbaijan on 1 December 1992. The national currency of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚Äì the Azerbaijani manat was issued into circulation on 15 August 1992 and was announced the only legal tender from 1 January 1994 onward. According to Para II, Article 19 of the first Constitution of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan, adopted by the 12 November 1995 referendum, the National Bank enjoys the exceptional right of issue of monetary units into and withdrawal from circulation. Currently, the Central Bank is guided by the third generation banking laws (second edition of the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan was adopted on 14 June 1996, and third edition on 10 December 2004). According to Decree of President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Changes to the Nominal Value of Monetary Units and the Scale of Prices (Denomination) in the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 7 February 2005, a new Manat (AZN) was issued into circulation on 1 January 2006 ‚Äì 1 new Manat was equal to 5,000 old Manats (AZM). AZM remained in parallel circulation with AZN in 2006 and only on 1 January 2007 the country started to use the new Manat. Discharge of the country‚Äôs central bank functions stipulated review of the bank‚Äôs name and it was renamed ‚Äòthe Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äô with the enforcement of the Referendum Act of the Republic of Azerbaijan on ‚ÄòMaking Additions and Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äô dated 18 March 2009. According to the amendments to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚ÄúOn the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù adopted on 4 March 2016, the authority to license, regulate and supervise banks were assigned to a newly established regulating body. Since then the Central Bank has focused on the monetary and exchange rate policy, safeguarding macroeconomic and financial stability, regulation and development of centralized interbank and other licensed payment systems and organization of cash circulation. According to the Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚ÄúOn improving management of the regulation and supervision of financial services market‚Äù issued on November 28, 2019, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority was liquidated. The authorities of the financial market supervisor stipulated by the applicable law, including rights and responsibilities in the areas of licensing of financial market services, regulation and supervision, protection of rights of investors and consumers of financial services, as well as FIMSA‚Äôs property were handed over to the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Goals and functions The main goal of the Central Bank is to maintain price stability within its authorities set by the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚ÄúOn the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù dated 10 December 2004. The goals of the Central Bank are also to organize and ensure operations of centralized interbank and other unlicensed payment systems, as well as support the stability of the banking system. Profit-making is not the main goal of the Central Bank. To achieve its goals the Central Bank: *conducts the monetary and foreign exchange policy; *organizes cash circulation; *sets an official exchange rate of Manat; *regulates and controls foreign currency; * regulates and license bank and insurance sector, supervises activities in bank and insurance sector within the provisions of the existing Law; * regulates securities market; *manages gold and foreign exchange reserves; *develops the balance of payments; *develops the country‚Äôs consolidated (both public and non-public) foreign debt statistics and international investment balance; *organizes and regulates payment systems. Structure and management The Central Bank‚Äôs organizational structure includes the Management Board, the central administrative body and regional offices. The central administrative body includes the internal audit unit, as well as other structural units defined by the Management Board. All structural units and bodies, including the central administrative body of the Central Bank, function according to statutes approved by the Management Board. The Central Bank is governed by the Management Board: * Governor ‚Äì Elman Rustamov * Board Members ‚Äì Alim Guliyev, Aftandil Babayev and Vadim Khubanov According to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan members of the Management Board are appointed by the National Parliament of the Republic of Azerbaijan upon presentation by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, while Governor and Deputy Governors of the Central Bank are appointed by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan from among the Management Board members. The Chairman of the Management Board of the Central Bank governs the Bank‚Äôs executive structure and chairs the Management Board, represents the Central Bank, segregates duties and responsibilities among senior management and addresses issues that do not fall under the Management Board jurisdiction according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan ‚ÄúOn the Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù. The Central Bank discharges its functions across the country via its regional offices. There are six regional branch offices of the Central Bank throughout the country: the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Office of the Central Bank; Ganja, Bilasuvar and Guba Regional Offices; Yevlakh and Sumgayit Reserve Centers.

The largest mangrove community in the ecoregion lies in the delta of the Godavari and Krishna rivers in Andhra Pradesh; other mangrove communities can be found at Point Calimere in Tamil Nadu, Pulicat Lake in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the Bhitarkanika Mangroves and Chilika Lake in Odisha, and the Pichavaram mangroves in Tamil Nadu. http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/im/im1401_full.html Godavari-Krishna mangroves at the World Wildlife Fund Flora The predominant mangroves are all of the species include Avicennia marina, Suaeda spp., Rhizophora spp., and Bruguiera spp. These have a thick canopy and an undergrowth of climbing plants and shrubs. Fauna Mangroves are an important coastal habitat for much wildlife such as the saltwater crocodiles who shelter among the roots and feed of the fish and other seafood in this warm mixture of fresh and seawater. These mangroves are home to many insects, molluscs, shrimp, crabs and fish as well as 140 bird species, including the threatened lesser florican (Eupodotis indica), best known for the male birds' leaping breeding displays, and large communities of aquatic birds such as egrets, flamingoes (Phoenicoptreus spp.), spot-billed pelicans (Pelecanus philippensis), Eurasian spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia), and painted storks (Mycteria leucocephala). Threats and preservation Mangroves are vulnerable to coastal development including prawn farming, other agriculture that diverts fresh water from reaching the coast and seaside urbanisation. Most mangroves on the east coast of India have been cleared and while 14% of the ecoregion is under protection in Point Calimere Wildlife and Bird Sanctuary, Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary and the Bhitarkanika National Park even those areas are not secure.

The state highway runs from MD 404 near Ridgely north to MD 313 at Baltimore Corner. MD 312 traverses northwestern Caroline County, connecting Ridgely with Bridgetown. The highway's first section was paved around Ridgely in the 1910s. The highway was completed from MD 404 to Ridgely in the mid-1920s and from north of Ridgely to Baltimore Corner in the late 1920s. Route description MD 312 northbound in Ridgely after MD 480 View north along MD 312 at MD 304 in Bridgetown MD 312 begins at an intersection with MD 404 (Shore Highway) between the towns of Hillsboro and Denton. The roadway continues south as county-maintained Log Cabin Road. MD 312 heads north as two-lane undivided Downes Station Road, passing through farmland until it curves to the east and meets MD 480 (Ridgely Road) on a tangent, joining that highway in a concurrency. After MD 776 (Sunset Boulevard), the old alignment of MD 312, splits to the north, MD 312 and MD 480 enter the town of Ridgely and the highway's name changes to Sixth Street. MD 312 leaves MD 480 by turning north onto Central Avenue, a two-lane street with very wide shoulders used for angle or perpendicular parking. The state highway intersects an abandoned railroad grade owned by the Maryland Department of Transportation after meeting the other end of MD 776 (Railroad Avenue). MD 312 leaves the town of Ridgely shortly after passing Ridgely Elementary School. The state highway continues north through farmland as Oakland Road, passing by Ridgely Airpark and through the hamlet of Oakland. MD 312 intersects MD 304 (Bridgetown Road) in Bridgetown and passes through a forested area before reaching its northern terminus at MD 313 (Goldsboro Road) at Baltimore Corner. History The first section of MD 312 was paved through Ridgely and north about toward Oakland by 1921. That highway was extended to Oakland by 1923. The state highway was constructed between MD 404 at Long's School House Corner and Ridgely in 1924 and 1925. The remainder of the highway through Bridgetown to MD 313 at Baltimore Corner was constructed between 1926 and 1929. MD 312 originally followed Sunset Boulevard and Railroad Avenue through Ridgely, rejoining the present route at Railroad Avenue's intersection with Central Avenue, which headed south as MD 480. In 1953, Sixth Street was completed between Sunset Boulevard and Central Avenue. MD 312 and MD 480, which was later extended west to Hillsboro, were assigned to the new road and MD 312 replaced MD 480 on Central Avenue.

Brill Online, 02 October 2014 It is a Mediterranean port at a distance of about from Adana city. Yumurtalƒ±k's population does not exceed 5,000 in winter, but in summer, it rises to 30 to 40,000 people since many inhabitants of Adana have holiday homes here. There are also many daily visitors during the holiday season. Yumurtalƒ±k has a large free economic zone housing the production units of up to thirty companies presently in operation or in phase of being built. Fields of activities include industries ranging from petrochemicals, synthetic fibers and steel industry, and there are also plans for establishing a major shipyard.  History  The port has a long history, at least to 2000BC. Hittite pottery of the 17th century BC has been found in the mound of Zeytinbeli H√∂y√ºk. This Cilician port city is mentioned by Pausanias under the name Aegeae ().Pausanias, Description of Greece, v.21.11 a name that appears also in its coinage, Andrew Burnett, Michael Amandry, Pere Pau Ripoll√®s, Ian Carradice, Roman Provincial Coinage, Supplement 2 (2006), Nos. 4030‚Äì4046 It was located on the Gulf of Issus (modern Gulf of ƒ∞skenderun). Tacitus' Annals XIII:8 also mentions it in its account of the war between Armenia/Rome and Iberia/Parthia. Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15 ‚Äì c. 100) made his early studies at Aegeae, when the city was at its cultural height. Under Rome, it was in the Roman province of Cilicia. The Saints Cosmas and Damian are mentionined in Christian hagiography to have been twin brothers, physicians who practiced their profession in Aegeae, accepting no payment for their services, and who eventually suffered martyrdom under Diocletian.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Sts. Cosmas and Damian\\" A view of the busy port of Laiazzo when Marco Polo visited it in 1271, as presented in Le Livre des Merveilles In the Middle Ages, and particularly in the 13th century, Aegeae grew to become an important harbour city of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The Venetians called Aegeae Aiazzo or (incorporating the initial of the definite article) Laiazzo, and it became known locally as Ayas ().Erdal Eser, \\"From the Roman Settlement of Aigai to Ayas\\" in VAMZ, 3.s., XLII 421‚Äì441 (2009), pp. 421‚Äì441 The fall of Acre and the silting up of the harbour of Tarsus, together with the advantage of Ayas's good roads eastward, led to the city's becoming the principal centre of trade between West and East. Numerous treaties were negotiated in which the Armenian kings granted various trade privileges to several Italian city-states. Between 1266 and 1322 raids by Mamluks and Turkmen in the area caused only minor disruptions in mercantile activities. Marco Polo disembarked here to begin his trip to China in 1271, he reportedly described it as a ‚Äúcity good for good trade,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúall spices, silk, gold and wool from inland were carried to this town.‚ÄùAya≈ü Antique Theatre in Turkey‚Äôs south raises curtains after 2,000 years The Battle of Laiazzo in 1294, in which the navy of the Republic of Genoa overcame that of the Republic of Venice, is thought by some to be that in which Marco Polo later became a prisoner of the Genoese.Quarterly Review, vols. 125‚Äì126, Leonard Scott Publishing Company, NY (1868)Leonardo Olschki, Marco Polo's Asia (University of California Press 1960), p. 103 Within the city a quarter and trading post belonging to another of the Italian maritime republics, Pisa, was also established. The city was increasingly oppressed by the Mamluks and fell definitively into their hands in 1347, and when European trade routes with the East moved away from the Mediterranean, the city and its harbour lost importance. Later, it was ruled by the Anatolian beylik of Ramadanids and in the 16th century, by the Ottoman Empire - eventually becoming part of the Turkish Republic. In 1974, actor and film director Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney was arrested at Yumurtalƒ±k after a shooting incident that involved the murder of a Yumurtalƒ±k judge.  Ecclesiastical History  Christianity came early to Aegeae, to judge by the numerous martyrs recorded in the Acta Sanctorum and the Greek menologia, of whom the most famous are Saints Cosmas and Damian, commemorated in the Roman Martyrology under 26 September.Martyrologium Romanum (Vatican 2001 ) The martyr Zenobius is traditionally considered to be the first bishop of Aegeae. Tarcodimantus, an Arian, was bishop at the time of the First Council of Nicaea (325). Patrophilus was a correspondent of Basil the Great; another unnamed bishop of Aegeae was an adversary of John Chrysostom; Eustathius was at the Council of Chalcedon (351) and was a correspondent of Theodoret; Julius was expelled from his see by Byzantine Emperor Justin I in 518 because of supporting Monophysitism; Thomas was at a synod in Mopsuestia in 550; and Paschalius was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. As indicated in a 6th-century Notitiae Episcopatuum, the see itself was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Anazarbus, the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia, to which Aegeae belonged.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 893-896Sophrone P√©trid√®s, v.

The single curving wall that constitutes the surviving land castle closes the tip of a small peninsula and is surrounded by the old town. The now missing seaward wall, which once followed the shore to enclose the entire ward, was visible in the late 19th century. Three round towers and a polygonal bastion survive as well as several casemates with loopholes (shooting ports) and at least seven embrasured windows. The basic plan of the fortress may have been laid in late antiquity, but extensive rebuilding belongs to the early period of Ottoman occupation, when it served as a minor port for the fleet of Suleiman the Magnificent. The sea castle, which is located on an island about 400 meters east of the shore, consists of a tight cluster of five chambers encased in a massive irregular bastion. Attached is a badly damaged circuit wall that surrounds most of the island. The vaulted rooms and enclosures were probably storage areas for merchandise destined for Europe. Although there are the distinct traces of late antique foundations (e.g., dovetail sockets), the peculiar masonry and construction techniques of the sea castle are those typically used during Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and may date from the reported re-fortification of the harbour in A.D. 1282.Bar Hebraeus, The Chronography of Gregory Ab√ª‚Äôl Faraj, vol.1, trans. E. A. W. Budge, Oxford, p.465. The watchtower, which is located 1.5 kilometers west of the land castle, was built by Suleiman the Magnificent in the mid 16th century with spolia from the nearby late antique city. The lower two floors are covered with stone vaults. The loopholes in the walls of all three levels are identical in design to those in the nearby Ottoman fortress of Payas.  Yumurtalƒ±k today  Yumurtalƒ±k Beach Ayas Castle Yumurtalƒ±k seen from the S√ºleyman's Tower The sea is clean and there is still a relaxed feel to this coast, so Yumurtalƒ±k is a holiday and weekend retreat for the people of Adana and of other cities in √áukurova region, who come to stay in seaside holiday flats generally built in compounds. There are also small hotels and guest houses for occasional visitor who can swim during the day and stroll along the beach or into the village in the evenings. The public beaches are not very well kept by the municipality, and they are sometimes covered with litter. But the holiday villages have private beaches which are kept clean and can also be used by outsiders for a small daily entrance fee. A number of beaches in Yumurtalƒ±k are also the nesting places for loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta breed. In fact the amount of beach-front holiday property is also part of the problem, even though the sand is clean the turtles won't lay eggs in these busy beaches with neon-lit discoth√®ques blasting out all night. Adequate protection for the turtle's nesting habitat continues to remain a critical question. These endangered species lay eggs only in Yumurtalƒ±k, in Akyatan beach in neighboring Karata≈ü district and in ƒ∞ztuzu Beach in Dalyan in southwestern Turkey. In fact, the very name Yumurtalƒ±k means, among other things, egg nest in Turkish language. As well as tourism, the fertile agricultural lands that extend behind the coast are also a key factor in local economy and quality tomatoes, watermelons and other fruits and vegetables are extensively produced in Yumurtalƒ±k. Just outside Yumurtalƒ±k is the Bota≈ü oil and natural gas terminal. It is the end of the Kirkuk‚ÄìCeyhan Oil Pipeline running from Northern Iraq, which was opened in the 1970s. Refined oils are also imported through here by sea. Immediately to the southwest, there is the oil terminal for crude oil pipeline from Baku, opened in 2006. Further in the same direction, there is the recently built ƒ∞sken Sug√∂z√º coal-fired power station.

It is located on the bank of √áoruh River 104 km south-west of the city of Artvin, on the road to Erzurum. The town of Yusufeli (population 5863) sits in a valley where the √áoruh River is joined by the Barhal, the surrounding countryside is a range of mountains running east to west, with villages in other valleys between the mountains. The micro climate allows the cultivation of olives, grapes, and citrus fruits, the driving forces of the economy in addition to tourism. The town can be reached by air via Erzurum Airport, away from Yusufeli or by road from Artvin, Erzurum and Trabzon (via ƒ∞spir in Erzurum Province). There is a widely criticised plan to dam the √áoruh at Yusufeli, which would submerge 15,000 homes.The Yusufeli dam projectFriends of the Earth: Campaigns: Corporates: AMEC and Spie pull out of Yusufeli DamBalfour Beatty withdraws support for the Ilisu Dam  Climate  Yusufeli has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb).  History  240px The history of Yusufeli, formerly Perterek or Pertarek, is traced to 3000 BC, the Bronze Age. The area has since been inhabited by Hurri, Urartu, Persians, Armenians, Ancient Romans, Byzantines and Georgians. In the Turkish era the area has been settled by Seljuks, Saltuks, Ilkhanates, Tamerlan, Akkoyunlu, Safevids and the Ottoman Empire. In the kingdom of Armenia in antiquity it was part of Tayk province, known as the Canton of Arsiats porhttp://www.bvahan.com/armenianway/great_armenia/Main_Eng/Maps_Eng/Maps_prov_Eng/Map_Eng.html. In 1879 the area was the district of Kiksim in the county of √áƒ±ldƒ±r. Then following the war between the Ottoman Empire and Russia it became a county of Erzurum. most of the population is descended from Armenians who were forced to convert to Islam in the 1700s. ‘ª’∂’≥’´’≥’•’°’∂ ’Ç., ‘±’∑’≠’°÷Ä’∞’°’£÷Ä’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂ ’π’∏÷Ä’´÷Å ’¥’°’Ω’°’∂÷Å ’°’∑’≠’°÷Ä’∞’´’ù ‘±’Ω’´’∏’µ, ‘µ÷Ç÷Ä’∏’∫’´’∏’µ, ‘±÷É÷Ä’´’Ø’∏’µ ÷á ‘±’¥’•÷Ä’´’Ø’∏’µ: ’Ñ’°’Ω’∂ ’°’º’°’ª’´’∂. ‘±’Ω’´’°, ’∞’ø. ‘±, ’é’•’∂’•’ø’´’Ø, 1806, ’ß’ª 93 Because of the rocky geography it was difficult for people from all villages to reach the city center, so a local district was established centred on √ñgdem, but this was still inaccessible so Kƒ±lƒ±√ßkaya (Ersis) became the center of county.

Such practices have been confirmed or suspected to occur within a handful of contexts. Medicine murder (not to be confused with \\"medical murder\\" due to medical negligence) means the killing of a human being in order to excise body parts to use as medicine or for magical purposes in witchcraft. Medicine murder is not viewed as a form of human sacrifice in a religious sense, because the motivation is not the death of a human or the effecting of magical changes through the death of a human being, but the obtaining of an item or items from their corpse to be used in traditional medicine. Its practice in the format described below occurs primarily in sub-equatorial Africa. The illegal organ trade has at times led to murder for body parts, because of a worldwide demand of organs for transplant and organ donors. At times, criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping people, especially children and teens, with the victims being killed and their organs harvested for the illegal organ trade. The extent is unknown, and non-fatal organ theft and removal is more widely reported than murder. In 2006, China was reported to be using its extensive pool of Falun Gong political prisoners as a supply for body parts to be used in transplants. The allegations and supporting testimony were raised in several countries and seen as deeply disturbing. Reports and testimony found that such prisoners were routinely assessed for transplants and apparent tissue typing, in a manner with no relevance to ordinary patient wellbeing, and that many were subsequently executed to meet demand for matching organs. China denied such practices. Historically, anatomy murders took place during the earlier parts of modern Western medicine. In the 19th century, the human body was still poorly understood, but fresh cadavers for dissection and anatomical study were sometimes difficult to obtain. Mortuaries remained the most common source, but in some cases, such as the notorious Irish murderers Burke and Hare, victims were killed instead and the killers then sold the bodies for study. Medicine murder=Purpose and frequency The objective of medicine murder is to create traditional medicine based partly on human flesh. Medicine murder is often termed ritual murder or muthi / muti murder, although there is evidence to suggest that the degree of ritual involved in the making of medicine is only a small element of the practice overall. Social anthropological ethnographies have documented anecdotes of medicine murder in southern Africa since the 1800s, and research has shown that incidences of medicine murder increase in times of political and economic stress. The practice is commonly associated with witchcraft, although ethnographic evidence suggests that this has not always been the case, and that it may have been accorded local-level political sanction. Medicine murder is difficult to describe concisely, as it has changed over time, involving an ever-greater variety of perpetrator, victim, method and motive. Most detailed information about the minutiae of medicine murder is derived from state witnesses in trials, court records and third-party anecdote. The phenomenon is widely acknowledged to occur in southern Africa, although no country has issued an accurate and up to date record of the frequency with which it takes place. This is not only because of the secrecy of the practice, given its controversial status, but also because of difficulties in classifying subcategories of murder. Medicine murder has been a topic of urban legends in South Africa, but this does not diminish its status as a practice that has resulted in legal trials and convictions of perpetrators. Medicine murder in southern Africa has been documented in some small detail in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, although it is a difficult subject to investigate because of its controversial standing in customary practices and laws. Very few research and discussion documents have been devoted to this subject. Three concerning Lesotho were published in 1951, 2000 and 2005 regarding the same events in the 1940s and 1950s; one concerning Swaziland was published in 1993 covering the 1970s and 1980s; and a commission of enquiry held in South Africa in 1995 covering medicine murder and witchcraft in the 1980s and 1990s. Methodology The perpetrators are usually men, although women have been convicted as well, most notably in Swaziland when Phillippa Mdluli was hanged in 1983 for commissioning a medicine murder. Perpetrators vary widely in age and social status. An individual or group of individuals commissions an inyanga (a herbalist skilled in traditional medicine) to assist them by concocting a medicine called muti. The medicine supposedly strengthens the 'personality' or personal force of the person who commissions the medicine. This increased personal force enables the person to excel in business, politics, or other sphere of influence. A human victim is identified for murder in order to create the medicine. Victims vary widely in age and social standing. They are often young children or elderly people, and are both male and female. In some instances, the victim is identified and 'purchased' via a transaction involving an often nominal amount of money. The victim is then abducted, often at night, and taken to an isolated place, often in the open countryside if the murder is being committed in a rural area. It is usually intended that the victim be mutilated while conscious, so that the medicine can be made more potent through the noises of the victim in agony. Mutilation does not take place in order to kill the victim, but it is expected that the victim will die of the wounds. Body parts excised mostly include soft tissue and internal organs ‚Äì eyelids, lips, scrota, labia and uteri ‚Äì although there have been instances where entire limbs have been severed. These body parts are removed to be mixed with medicinal plants to create a medicine through a cooking process. The resulting medicine is sometimes consumed, but is often made into a paste that is carried on the person or rubbed onto scarifications.  Variances  Since the 1970s, the manner in which medicine murder is practiced has become altered to the methods described above, although the continued practice of medicine murder demonstrates that belief in human flesh as a powerful medicinal component remains strong in some communities. It would appear that medicine murder in the 18th and 19th centuries may have been considered the legitimate domain of traditional chiefs and leaders, in order to improve agriculture and protect against war (see Human sacrifice). Following industrialisation and growth of commerce, the range of purposes for which medicine was used to increase influence expanded significantly. In the early 1990s when South Africa was experiencing internal political strife between several political groupings, it became clear that some mutilations for medicine were opportunistic and incidental to the assassination of political opponents. There have also been occurrences of mutilation of corpses in medical facilities. In not all cases does the employment of a traditional healer seem to have been thought necessary to the process. Notable cases 1994 Segametsi Mogomotsi case= In 1994, a 14-year-old named Segametsi Mogomotsi was murdered in Mochudi, Botswana and body parts removed. The killing was widely believed to have been for muti, and the police even recovered some excised organs. However, these were destroyed before being tested to establish them as human, leading to accusations of police complicity with the murder. The killing led to riots as students in Mochudi protested about police inaction, and eventually Scotland Yard from Britain were asked to investigate, as neutral outsiders. Their report was given to the Botswana government, which did not release it to the public. These events inspired some of the events in the book The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith. =2001 Thames torso case= A little boy whose headless and limbless body was found floating in the Thames in 2001 was identified by an arrestee in March 2011. The five-year-old's identity has remained a mystery after he was smuggled into Britain and murdered in a voodoo-style ritual killing. He was drugged with a ‚Äòblack-magic‚Äô potion and sacrificed before being thrown into the Thames, where his torso washed up next to the Globe Theatre in September 2001. Detectives used pioneering scientific techniques to trace radioactive isotopes in his bones to his native Nigeria. They even enlisted Nelson Mandela to appeal for information about the murder. CNN They struggled to formally identify the boy, whom they called Adam, despite travelling to the West African state to try to trace his family. Nigerian Joyce Osiagede, the only person to be arrested in Britain as part of the inquiry, has claimed that the victim's real name is Ikpomwosa. In an interview with ITV's London Tonight, Mrs Osiagede said she looked after the boy in Germany for a year before travelling to Britain without him in 2001. She claimed she handed the boy over to a man known as Bawa who later told her that he was dead and threatened to kill her unless she kept silent. Police have passed numerous files on the case to the Crown Prosecution Service but it has never gone to court. A second suspect, a Nigerian man, was arrested in Dublin in 2003 but was never charged. Mrs Osiagede was first questioned by police after they found clothing similar to that worn by ‚ÄòAdam‚Äô in her Glasgow tower-block flat in 2002. The only clothing on his body was a pair of orange shorts, exclusively sold in Woolworths in Germany and Austria. Dressed in a traditional gold and green dress, Mrs Osiagede denied any involvement with the death of the young boy. Asked who killed him, she said a ‚Äògroup of people‚Äô. She added: \\"They used him for a ritual in the water.\\" Claiming the boy was six years old, she said: ‚ÄòHe was a lively boy. A very nice boy, he was also intelligent.‚Äô Detailed analysis of a substance in the boy's stomach was identified as a ‚Äòblack magic‚Äô potion. It included tiny clay pellets containing small particles of pure gold, an indication that Adam was the victim of a Muti ritual killing in which it is believed that the body parts of children are sacred. Bodies are often disposed of in flowing water. = 2009 Masego Kgomo case = Masego Kgomo was a 10-year-old South African girl whose body parts were removed and sold to a sangoma in Soshanguve, South Africa. The little girl's body was found in bushes near the Mabopane railway station, north-west of Pretoria. Thirty-year- old Brian Mangwale was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Illegal organ trade murders (the 'Red trade') According to the World Health Organization (WHO), illegal organ trade occurs when organs are removed from the body for the purpose of commercial transactions. The illegal organ trade is growing, and a recent report by Global Financial Integrity estimates that globally it generates profits between $0.6 billion and $1.2 billion per year In some cases, criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping of people, especially children and teens, who are murdered and their organs harvested for profit. In 2014 an alleged member of the Mexican Knights Templar cartel was arrested for the kidnapping and deaths of minors, after children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van. According to the most recent Bulletin of the World Health Organization on the state of the international organ trade, 66,000 kidney transplants, 21,000 liver transplants, and 6000 heart transplants were performed globally in 2005, while another article reports that 2008 the median waiting time for the U.S. transplant list in 2008 was greater than 3 years and expected to rise, while the United Kingdom reported a lack of organs for 8000 patients, with the rate increasing at 8%. It was estimated that about 10% of all transplants occur illegally, with the Internet acting as a facilitator. Transplant tourism raises concerns because it involves the transfer of healthy organs in one direction, depleting the regions where organs are bought. This transfer typically occurs from South to North, developing to developed nations, females to males, and from colored peoples to whites, a trend that some experts say \\"has exacerbated old...divisions\\". While some organs such as the kidney can be transplanted routinely and the single remaining kidney is adequate for normal human needs, other organs are less easy to source. Liver transplants in particular are prominent, but incur an excruciating recovery that deters donations. Most countries have laws which criminalize the buying and selling of organs, or the carrying out of medical procedures for the illegal organ trade.  Capital punishment and organ harvesting in China  In March 2006, three individuals alleged that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners had been killed at Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital, to supply China's organ transplant industry.\\"Secret Chinese Concentration Camp Revealed\\" 10 March 2006 The Epoch Times\\"New Witness Confirms Existence of Chinese Concentration Camp, Says Organs Removed from Live Victims\\" 17 March 2006 The Epoch Times\\"Source Reveals Other Chinese Concentration Camps, Sujiatun is merely one of 36 concentration camps for Falun Gong in China\\" 31 March 2006 The Epoch Times The third person, a doctor, said the so-called hospitals in Sujiatun are but one of 36 similar concentration camps all over China. The allegations were the subject of investigative reports by Edward McMillan- Scott,Edward McMillan-Scott (7 July 2006) EP Vice-President's Investigative Report on Organ Harvesting in China The Epoch Times Vice-President of the European Parliament, and by former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas. The Kilgour-Matas reportReuters, AP (8 July 2006) \\"Falun Gong organ claim supported\\" The Age, (Australia)Endemann, Kirstin (6 July 2006) CanWest News Service \\"Ottawa urged to stop Canadians travelling to China for transplants\\" Ottawa Citizen stated \\"the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained\\" and concluded that \\"there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners\\". The report called attention to the extremely short wait times for organs in China‚Äîone to two weeks for a liver compared with 32.5 months in Canada‚Äînoting that this was indicative of organs being procured on demand. A significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponded with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. The report includes incriminating material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, and transcripts of interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs.David Kilgour, David Matas (6 July 2006, revised 31 January 2007) An Independent Investigation into Allegations of Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China (free in 22 languages at organharvestinvestigation.net) An updated version of their report was published as a book in 2009.

Responses were noted from the Queensland Ministry of Health in Australia (abolished training programs for Chinese doctors in organ transplant procedures and banned joint research with China on organ transplantation), A petition signed by 140 Canadian physicians urged the Government to warn Canadian nationals that organ transplants in China were \\"sourced almost entirely from non-consenting people\\". In 2012, State Organs: Transplant Abuse in China, edited by David Matas and Dr. Torsten Trey, was published with contributions from 12 specialists. Several of the essays in the book conclude that a primary source of organs has been prisoners of conscience, specifically practitioners of Falun Gong. In May 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000.Market Wired (8 May 2008) China's Organ Harvesting Questioned Again by UN Special Rapporteurs: FalunHR Reports Retrieved 26 October 2014 In August 2009, Manfred Nowak the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture said, \\"The Chinese government has yet to come clean and be transparent ... It remains to be seen how it could be possible that organ transplant surgeries in Chinese hospitals have risen massively since 1999, while there are never that many voluntary donors available.\\"  Murder for dissection and study An anatomy murder (sometimes called burking in British English) is a murder committed in order for all or part of the cadaver to be used for medical research or teaching. It is not a medicine murder because the body parts are not believed to have any medicinal use in themselves. The motive for the murder is created by the demand for cadavers for dissection, and the opportunity to learn anatomy and physiology as a result of the dissection. Rumors concerning the prevalence of anatomy murders are associated with the rise in demand for cadavers in research and teaching produced by the Scientific Revolution. During the nineteenth century, the sensational serial murders associated with Burke and Hare and the London Burkers led to legislation which provided scientists and medical schools with legal ways of obtaining cadavers. The practice has intermittently been reported since that time; in 1992 Colombian activist Juan Pablo Ordo√±ez, claimed that 14 poor residents of the town of Barranquilla had been killed for local medical studyMary Roach (2003). Stiff. W.W. Norton. with a purported account by an alleged escapee being publicized by the international press. Rumors persist that anatomy murders are carried out wherever there is a high demand for cadavers. These rumors are hard to substantiate, and may reflect continued, deep-held fears of the use of cadavers as commodities.

Acoustic cleaning apparatus, usually built into the material-handling equipment, works by generating powerful sound waves which shake particulates loose from surfaces, reducing the need for manual cleaning. History and design  An acoustic cleaner consists of a sound source similar to an air horn found on trucks and trains, attached to the material-handling equipment, which directs a loud sound into the interior. It is powered by compressed air rather than electricity so there is no danger of sparking, which could set off an explosion. It consists of two parts: *The acoustic driver. In the driver, compressed air escaping past a diaphragm causes it to vibrate, generating the sound. It is usually made from solid machined stainless steel. The diaphragm, the only moving part, is usually manufactured from special aerospace grade titanium to ensure performance and longevity. *The bell, a flaring horn, usually made from spun 316 grade stainless steel. The bell serves as a sound resonator, and its flaring shape couples the sound efficiently to the air, increasing the volume of sound radiated. The overall length of acoustic cleaner horns range from 430 mm to over 3 metres long. The device can operate from a pressure range of 4.8 to 6.2 bars or 70 to 90 psi. The resultant sound pressure level will be around 200 dB. There are generally 4 ways to control the operation of an acoustic cleaner. *The most common is by a simple timer *Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) *Programmable logic controller (PLC) *Manually by ball valve An acoustic cleaner will typically sound for 10 seconds and then wait for a further 500 seconds before sounding again. This ratio for on/off is approximately proportional to the working life of the diaphragm. Provided the operating environment is between ‚àí40 C and 100 ¬∞C, a diaphragm should last between 3 and 5 years. The wave generator and the bell have a much longer life span and will often outlast the environment in which they operate. The older bells which were made from cast iron were susceptible to rusting in certain environments. The new bells made from 316 spun steel have no problem with rust and are ideal for sterile environments such as found in the food industry or in pharmaceutical plants. Acoustic cleaning began in the early 1970s with experiments using ship horns or air raid sirens. The first acoustic cleaners were made from cast iron. From 1990 onwards the technology became commercially viable and began to be used in dry processing, storage, transport, power generation and manufacturing industries. The latest technology uses 316 spun stainless steel to ensure optimum performance. Operation and performance The majority of acoustic cleaners operate in the audio frequency range from 60 hertz up to 420 Hz. However a few operate in the infrasonic range, below 40 Hz, which is mostly below the human hearing range, to satisfy strict noise control requirements. There are three scientific fields which converge in the understanding of acoustic cleaning technology. *Sound propagation. This relates to an understanding of the nature of the sound waves, how they vary and how they will interact with the environment. *Mathematics of the environment. Materials science, surface friction, distance and areas familiar to a mechanical engineer. *Chemical engineering. The chemical properties of the powder or substance to be debonded. Especially the auto adhesive properties of the powder. An acoustic cleaner will create a series of very rapid and powerful sound induced pressure fluctuations which are then transmitted into the solid particles of ash, dust, granules or powder. This causes them to move at differing speeds and debond from adjoining particles and the surface that they are adhering to. Once they have been separated then the material will fall off due to gravity or it will be carried away by the process gas or air stream. The key features which determine whether or not an acoustic cleaner will be effective for any given problem are the particle size range, the moisture content and the density of the particles as well as how these characteristics will change with temperature and time. Typically particles between 20 micrometres and 5 mm with moisture content below 8.5% are ideal. Upper temperature limits are dependent upon the melting point of the particles and acoustic cleaners have been employed at temperatures above 1000 C to remove ash build-up in boiler plants. It is important to match the operating frequencies to the requirements. Higher frequencies can be directed more accurately whilst lower frequencies will carry further, and are generally used for more demanding requirements. A typical selection of frequencies available would be as follows: *420 Hz for a small acoustic cleaner which might be used to clear bridging at the base of a silo. *350 Hz will be more powerful and this frequency can be used to unblock material build-up in ID (induced draft) fans, filters, cyclones, mixers, dryers and coolers. *230 Hz. At this frequency, the power involved is sufficient to use in most electricity generation applications. *75 Hz and 60 Hz. These are generally the most powerful acoustic cleaners and are often used in large vessels and silos. Health and safety The introduction of acoustic cleaners has been a significant improvement in many areas of health and safety. For instance in silo cleaning - the previous solutions tended to be intrusive or destructive. Air cannons, soot blowers, external vibrators, hammering or costly man entry are all superseded by noninvasive sonic horns. An acoustic cleaner requires no down time and will operate during normal usage of the site. Taking the example of silo cleaning a little further, there are two typical problems. Bridging This is when the silo blocks at the outlet. Previously the problem was addressed by manual cleaning from underneath the silo which in its turn introduced significant risk from falling material when the blockage was cleared. An acoustic cleaner is able to operate from the top of a silo through in situ material to clear the blockage at the base. Rat holing Compaction on the side of a silo. This not only reduces the operating volume in a silo but it also compromises quality control by disrupting the first in first out cycle. Older material compacted on the side of a silo can also start to degrade and produce dangerous gases. An acoustic cleaner will produce sound waves which will make the compacted material resonate at a different rate to the surrounding environment resulting in debonding and clearance. Advantages of acoustic cleaners *Repetitive use during operations means that there are fewer unscheduled shut downs. *Improved material flow by the elimination of hang-ups, blocking and bridging. *Minimisation of cross contamination by ensuring complete emptying of the environment. *Improved cleaning and reduction of health and safety risks. *Increased energy efficiency. Reducing the buildup on heat exchange surfaces results in lower energy usage. *Extended plant life. Aggressive cleaning regimes are avoided. *Ease of operation. It is easy to automate the horns either at regular intervals or to tie the sounding in to changes in their environment such as pressure or flow rates. *Importantly they prevent the material buildup problem from occurring in the first place. These advantages mean that the financial payback is often very quick. It is also possible to compare acoustic cleaners directly to alternative solutions. *Air cannons. These are well established but are expensive with limited coverage thus requiring multi unit purchase. They are also noise intrusive and have a high compressed air consumption. *Vibrators. These are easy to fit to an empty silo but can cause structural damage as well as contributing to powder compaction. *Low friction linings. These are very quiet but are expensive to install. Also they are prone to erosion and can then contaminate the environment or product. *Inflatable pads and liners. Again these are easy to install in an empty silo. They help side wall buildup but have no impact on bridging. They are also hard to maintain and can cause compaction. *Fluidisation through a 1 way membrane. This can help already compacted material. However they are expensive and difficult to install and maintain. They can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging. Specific applications for acoustic cleaners *Boilers. Cleaning of the heat transfer surfaces. *Electrostatic precipitators. Acoustic cleaners are being used for cleaning hoppers, turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires. *Super heaters, economisers and air heaters. *Duct work. *Filters. Acoustic cleaners are used on reverse air, pulse jet and shaker units. They are effective in reducing pressure drop across the collection surface which will increase bag life and prevent hopper pluggage. Generally they can totally replace the both reverse air fans and shaker units and significantly reduce the compressed air requirement on pulse jet filters. *ID fans. Acoustic cleaning helps to provide a uniform cleaning pattern even for inaccessible parts of the fan. This maintains the balance of the fan. *Kiln inlet. Acoustic cleaners help to prevent particulate buildup at the kiln inlet and this will minimise nose ring formation. *Mechanical pre Collectors. Acoustic cleaners help prevent buildup around the impellers and between the tubes. *Mills. Acoustic cleaners help maintain material flow and also prevent blockages in the pre grind silos. They also help prevent material buildup in the downstream separators and fans. *Planetary Coolers. Acoustic cleaners help prevent bridging and ensure complete evacuation. *Precipitator. Acoustic cleaners help clean the turning vanes, distribution plates, collecting plates and electrode wires. They can either assist or replace the mechanical rapping systems. They also prevent particulate buildup in the under hoppers which would otherwise result in opacity spiking. *Pre heaters. Used in towers, gas risers, cyclones and fans. *Ship cargo holds. Used both to clean and de aerate current loads. *Silos and hoppers. To prevent bridging and rat holing. *Static cyclones. Acoustic cleaners will work both within the cyclone and with the associated duct work.

Distance estimates for this nebula vary widely, with a range of considered the most plausible. It was discovered by William Herschel on November 13, 1790, describing it as \\"a most singular phaenomenon\\" and forcing him to rethink his ideas on the construction of the heavens. Up until this point Herschel was convinced that all nebulae consisted of masses of stars too remote to resolve, but now here was a single star \\"surrounded with a faintly luminous atmosphere.\\" He concluded: \\"Our judgement I may venture to say, will be, that the nebulosity about the star is not of a starry nature.\\" This is a double-shell nebula that is described as, \\"a bright roundish amorphous PN\\" with a radius of around and a faint halo that has a radius of . It consists of an outer shell, an inner shell, and bright blobs. An alternative description is of \\"lumpy nebula composed of numerous small bubbles\\" with a somewhat filamentary structure in the outer shell. Infrared observations show a huge region of dust surrounds the planetary nebula, spanning . The combined mass of the gas and dust is estimated at The nebula originated from a binary star system with the designation HD 281679 from the Henry Draper Catalogue. The bright, visible component is a giant star on the horizontal branch with a stellar classification of A0III, while the nebula-generating companion is now a hot, sub-luminous O-type star. During the formation of the nebula, the pair shared a common envelope and had an orbital period of around 4‚Äì9 days. The progenitor star had a mass estimated at 4.5 times the mass of the Sun. When the progenitor entered its early-asymptotic giant branch phase and expanded to fill its roche lobe, mass transfer occurred and the pair spiraled inward by transferring their orbital energy into the expanding envelope.

The state highway runs from MD 313 and MD 318 on the west side of Federalsburg east to MD 318 east of Federalsburg. MD 315, which is the old routing of MD 318 through downtown Federalsburg, is maintained by the town within the town limits and on either side of the town limits by the Maryland State Highway Administration. MD 315 follows what were sections of MD 319, MD 313, and MD 318, which were constructed between the late 1910s and mid-1920s. The highway became fully part of MD 318 in the mid-1950s. The highway was designated as MD 315 in the early 1960s after MD 318 was moved to the Federalsburg Bypass. Route description View north along MD 315 just northeast of Federalsburg MD 315 begins at an intersection with MD 313 and MD 318 on the west side of Federalsburg.

The ship was built in Germany in 1958 and worked in the coastal trades. In 1982 the ship was bought by Ki Longfellow-Stanshall, the wife of Vivian Stanshall, refitted, and brought to Bristol in 1983 as the Old Profanity Showboat. It was used as a theatre to showcase music of every sort, including cabaret, comedy, plays, musicals, and poetry events. The ship also contained an art gallery. The living quarters were home for Vivian, Ki, their daughter, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall, and Ki's daughter, Sydney Longfellow, as well as a few key personnel. During the 1990s, under new management, it was run as a rent-a-nightclub. The ship has now been returned to its original working name of Thekla and is run as a night club and venue for various bands by Daybrook House Promotions. Construction and working life Thekla loading timber Thekla in high seas Built in Yard No. 185, Thekla was launched on 12 July 1958 by B√ºsumer-Schiffswerft W & E Sielaff at B√ºsum, Schleswig-Holstein for the Schepers family of Haren/Ems. One of the last riveted ships to be produced (the hulls of metal ships have long been made by welding plates), she measured 424 gross registered tons and had a deadweight tonnage of 718 tons. Her overall length is and breadth , with a draft. Theklas hold was lined with Australian red jarrah, one of the hardest woods. With a single screw propulsion, she was powered by a diesel engine made by Bohn & K√§hler, Kiel and was said to be a U-boat engine left over from the Second World War, however these engines were not built until the 1950s. Thekla was a coastal trading vessel carrying a variety of cargoes between northern and western European ports, particularly timber from ports of the Baltic Sea. During her trading life, she remained on the ship register of Haren/Ems, passing in ownership from Johann Schepers to Josef Sch√¥ning and then Bernhard Schepers but with no change of name. After running aground at Gatesend, Norfolk, she was left rusting away for seven years in the half-abandoned docks of Sunderland on the eastern coast of England, before being purchased by the Stanshalls for ¬£15,000. Finding and converting a ship into a showboat The Stanshalls obtained funds from The Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme, whereby a bank lends the money, and the UK government guarantees the loan. Thekla was considered ideal. Everything had to be refurbished from the U-boat engine (left over from the Second World War, as mentioned above), to the leaky hydraulics to the winch for raising and lowering the anchors. In the summer of 1983, she set sail for Bristol on the opposite side of Britain, a city chosen because Vivian had once played there as frontman for The Bonzo Dog Band, and because Ki liked the sound of the place. Fresh out of dry dock with her bottom scraped, she was covered in a new coat of black paint and white paint over her original colours of pale blue and white, with red chosen for the stack. With all the ironwork and welding accomplished, Thekla sailed to Bristol in six days and six nights. Sailing into tumult Vivian paints the doors into the hold From the open sea, Thekla entered the Severn on 4 August 1983 and navigated its waters until it arrived in the Floating Harbour of the city of Bristol, and where it is still moored. She had sailed without ballast, without registration, without insurance, and without mishap, save for the half-day the crew spent mending the engine. Her conversion, sailing, docking, finishing touches, and opening night on 1 May 1984 was filmed as an Omnibus BBC 1 documentary by writer and film maker Tony Staveacre of the BBC. He called it The Bristol Showboat Saga and it was broadcast for the first time on 30 September of that year. This film can be found on YouTube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXS6KotKctE Old Profanity days For the next two and a half years, The Old Profanity Showboat (nicknamed the Old Pro) put on over 240 theatrical productions, staging the varied efforts of theatrical troupes from all over Britain, plus the work of the students of the nearby Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. It was one of the first venues to stage Robert Longden and Hereward Kaye's Moby Dick the Musical. To support its theatre and cabaret (which seldom paid for itself), the Old Pro also provided a stage for bands. Within a year, the Old Pro was in use as a small theatre, jazz venue, folk club and cabaret. Across her stage came hopefuls who became \\"names,\\" and often unannounced \\"names\\" who wanted to once again experience the intimacy of their first foray into show business. Many of Britain's best and brightest comedians either played there, or stayed there. Stinkfoot Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall in the hold, early days Many of the Old Pro's employees worked the bar or the box office or ship's maintenance to find themselves one day treading her stage. After two years of waiting, Ki felt they could wait no longer. No matter how much it cost to stage an original show, the time had come to reward their hard work and dedication. Co-written by Vivian Stanshall and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall, Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera was a three-hour-long musical comedy (Vivian called it a \\"comic opera\\"), produced by Ki, directed by Vivian (working with both actors and orchestra at the same time), and performed on the Old Pro over a two-week run up to Christmas in December 1985. Stinkfoot's cast and orchestra consisted of the employees, as well as regulars who'd graced Theklas stage. Its set made use of Theklas curious layout. Its conception was based on a series of tales Ki wrote about a New York City alley cat and on Vivian's life as a Bonzo frontman. In its final form, it was a surreal and dazzling cross-cultural mix of music hall, Broadway, and Thirties screwball comedies. But mostly, it was \\"just being itself,\\" as Vivian would say. It played to sell-out audiences every single night of its run, attracted people from Scotland to the US, and it garnered wonderful, if slightly puzzled, reviews from not only the Bristol press, but The Guardian and The Times. Staged a second time in late 1988 at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London, it lacked the cockeyed appeal of Theklas unusual setting, and the hand-picked Bristol cast and orchestra (for which much of the material was specifically crafted). Interest in restaging the show was maintained, and in late 2008 was partly realised. The comic opera was trimmed from three hours to two, and became a \\"Stinkfoot Showcase\\". The show played Thekla (where it was written and first staged), on 20, 21, 22 and 24 July 2010. This was a showcase of Stinkfoot's songs backed by a full band and selected cast members (including Nikki Lamborn and Vivian and Ki's daughter Silky Longfellow-Stanshall) plus special guests. Tony Slattery narrated and sang. Though open to the public, the showcase was intended to attract backers for the revival of the full musical. It attracted the attention of major press (The Word magazine, Mojo magazine, BBC London & BBC Bristol), and theatres like the Bristol Old Vic. Closure By early 1986, even though the ship had survived the expense of staging Stinkfoot, and even though there was a plan to sail Thekla at least to the port of New York City to try her artistic mettle there, Ki had become exhausted by the day-to-day running of such a huge venture. Vivian, buoyed by the experience of Stinkfoot, was eager to renew his recording career, and Ki to continue her career as a novelist. Ki was also experiencing ill-health due to the stress of managing something so complex as The Old Profanity Showboat. Announcing closure of the ship, there came a deluge of protest by artists and customers whose home it had become. Accordingly, the Old Pro continued to showcase theatre and bands until August 1986. Ki, Vivian, and Silky retreated to the Bristol home of an Old Profanity regular, the actor David Rappaport (who appeared in the film Time Bandits).

Over these years some of Bristol's best known artists (including Massive Attack, Portishead and Roni Size) began by playing in Theklas hull. Work by the artist Banksy can be seen stencilled over the bulkheads inside the club as well as his much larger work on the outside of the hull at the waterline. This piece was painted over by the harbour master, much to the annoyance of the club's owners, who threatened the council and harbour master with legal action. Banksy returned to paint it again. The painting of the \\"Grim Reaper\\" is now on display at the M Shed. A refurbishment of the ship was completed in October 2006 after being purchased by Daybrook House Promotions, owners of Rock City, Rescue Rooms, Stealth and The Bodega in Nottingham. She remains at the moorings in central Bristol where she was first positioned in 1983 and continues to function as a music venue and nightclub. Artists such as Franz Ferdinand, The New York Dolls, Pete Doherty, Tokyo Police Club, The Growlers, Santigold, Wire, Kevin Coyne, The Chords in their final gig in the classic line-up, and local bands from Bristol and Bath have played at Thekla since DHP purchased the venue. The ship was repainted from black to cream and dark green. In May 2009 Thekla celebrated its 25th anniversary with a day and night long event featuring bands selected to represent the best of what was happening on the Bristol music scene.

It is also known as Corner Card and Vanishing Cross, due to the arrangement of the foundations and the tableau respectively. Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith rate the odds of successfully completing Four Seasons as 1 in 10.Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith. The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience. Foulsham, Slough, (2001). Rules First, five cards are dealt in form of a cross: three cards are placed in a row, then two cards are each placed above and below the middle of the three cards. A sixth card is dealt in the upper left corner of the cross. This card will be the base for the first of four foundations. During the game the three other cards of this rank will eventually be placed in the other three corners of the cross as foundations. The foundations are built up according to suit, and building is round-the-corner, i.e. aces are placed above kings, except when aces are the foundation bases. Cards in the cross are built down regardless of suit and any space in the cross is filled with any available card, whether it is the top card of a pile within the cross, the top card of the wastepile, or a card from the stock. Like the foundations, building in the cross is round-the-corner, i.e. kings are placed over aces, unless aces are the foundations. Only one card can be moved at a time. Whenever the game goes on a standstill, the stock is dealt one card at a time into the wastepile, the top card of which is available for play on the cross or on the foundations. There is no redeal. The game ends if a standstill occurs after the stock has run out. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. Variations Variations of Four Seasons include: *In Czarina, any space in the cross is immediately filled only from the stock. *In Corners, the cross is a reserve instead of a tableau, with each space being a cell that can hold at most one card. Empty cells in this game are filled immediately from the stock. *In Simplicity, instead of a cross the tableau contains twelve cards dealt into two rows of six. The thirteenth card dealt becomes the base of the first foundation. Also, building in the tableau is down by alternating colors. Other related games include Florentine Patience and Little Windmill.

After the Communist Party of Lithuania separated from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), he established alternative pro-CPSU Communist Party of Lithuania in early 1990, and led it as the First Secretary of Central Committee until its ban in 1991. He was the only Lithuanian to serve in the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee, and did so from 1990 until its ban in 1991.  Biography  He was born in Alytus, Lithuania in 1927. In 1942, a young Burokeviƒçius was employed as a carpenter and a machinist at a plant in Udmurtia. In 1944 he became a member of the Lithuanian Communist Party where he worked as a chief of department and instructor. He graduated from the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute (now the Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences) in 1955 and the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in 1963. In 1963 he became a research fellow at the Institute of the History of the Party of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party. He died in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2016, aged 88.  Political activities  After the Communist Party of Lithuania voted to separate from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in December 1989, he became the Secretary General of the Moscow-backed communist party and on March 4, 1990 he gained the title of the First Secretary. His party's political programme stated that one of its goals was to maintain Lithuania as part of the USSR. Seven members of Burokeviƒçius' party were elected during the Supreme Council of Lithuania elections on 24 February 1990. The Supreme Council declared reinstantment of Lithuania's independence during its first session in March. On 11 January 1991 the pro-CPSU CPL sent an ultimatum to the Government of Lithuania, ordering it to comply with USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev's public requirement that the Supreme Council would immediately reinstate the legal force of the USSR and Lithuanian SSR Constitutions. The requirement was voiced one day earlier. The party added that failing that it might create the \\"Lithuanian National Rescue Committee\\" (), \\"which would take care of the matters of the future of the LSSR\\" - and eventually did so. During its lifetime, the party established several organizations meant to be alternative ministries. The Soviet Army assault on the Vilnius TV tower and station on January 13, 1991 followed, during which 14 people were killed. During the period of 11 to 19 January 1991, the pro-CPSU party also made five more public declarations urging the forceful overthrow of the Government and other authorities of independent Lithuania. Burokeviƒçius took part preparing those declarations.  Lawsuit  Burokeviƒçius was indicted by Lithuanian prosecutors as a suspect in a criminal with regard to the January Events case on 22 August 1991. He was eventually arrested on January 15, 1994 in Belarus (on Lithuanian orders). Burokeviƒçius and five other members of the Lithuanian Communist Party were tried for their involvement in the January Events from October 1996 to August 1999.

It originally opened in 1868 and closed in 1871: it then reopened in 1886, before closing permanently in 1890. Its site was used for the building of Croydon Town Hall, erected in 1892‚Äì1896.  Authorisation  Then a thriving market town of around 20,000 inhabitants on the southern fringe of London, Croydon was first connected with the railway network in 1839 when the London and Croydon Railway opened a station (now West Croydon) on London Road. Two years later, the London and Brighton Railway opened a station (now East Croydon) on the other side of town. Both stations were a fair distance from the town centre and the local stage coach, previously the dominant mode of transport but now undercut by the railway, sought to create new business by ferrying passengers to and from the stations. This situation prevailed until 1863 when, under pressure to provide a more convenient station, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) (formed in 1846 by a merger of the Brighton and Croydon companies) promoted the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (Additional Powers) Bill which, amongst other matters, sought authorisation for the construction of a branch from East Croydon to Katharine Street, where a new \\"Central Station\\" would be built. The Act passed into law on 29 July 1864 and the LBSCR began purchasing the necessary land, a whole block between the present-day Mint Walk and Katharine Street up to the High Street. The line and station were initially intended to approach Katharine Street at an angle, but a realignment of the route made it parallel with Katharine Street, reducing the amount of land needed. The plot of land to the west of Park Street was purchased for ¬£11,217 and a contract was awarded to Messrs John T Chappell of Steyning to construct the line and station for ¬£4,089. An Ordnance Survey map surveyed in 1867‚Äì69 shows the station as \\"Katharine Street Station\\", which may have been an early proposed name. The station opened as Central Croydon, leaving the map in error. The branch left the Brighton Main Line just south of George Street and curved sharply west, where the Fairfield Halls are today. It passed under Park Lane, through the present-day Queen's Gardens to the site of the Croydon Clocktower and Town Hall.  Operations  crossovers Opened on 1 January 1868, the station was served from platforms 1 and 2 of New Croydon, an extension of East Croydon dealing with local traffic. Initially there were 12 trains per day, to and from London Bridge, but the commercial judgement that had created the station went unrewarded and services ceased after three years, on 1 December 1871. The station was mothballed until 1 June 1886 when, under pressure from the council, it was reopened. Around this time, the LBSCR sought to improve the usefulness of the branch by extending it under High Street to curve around to the right to join the West Croydon - Epsom line at West Croydon, but this plan, which might have seen it become a viable station, was not realised. Poster advertising the station's final closure The reopening of the station in 1886 was for London & North Western Railway and Great Eastern Railway (not LBSCR) trains, providing, by all accounts, a generally poor service. The withdrawal of services on 1 September 1890 came therefore as little surprise; it was hoped that the station would give impetus to the development of High Street, but this never materialised and ironically it was only after the demolition of the station that plans for the area could be advanced. Two years before reopening, a \\"High Street Improvement Committee\\" had been set up with the aim of carrying out necessary civic improvements such as the widening of High Street and the laying of a tram line, and the station, which occupied the main road frontage, stood in the way. Anxious to rid itself of an unprofitable facility, in 1889 the LBSCR offered the land for sale for ¬£12,500. A figure of ¬£11,500 was agreed on condition that the LBSCR leave in place the retaining walls supporting part of Katharine Street. The Council intended to erect its Municipal Offices, Courts, a Police Station and Library on part of the land, hoping that the presence of public facilities would increase the value of the remainder. By 1890, the necessary agreements and consents for the sale were in place, drawing to a close Central Croydon's short history.

The gardens are bordered by Croydon Town Hall, Bernard Weatherill House, the site of the former Taberner House, Park Lane and Katharine Street. In their present form, and under their present name, the gardens and their central fountain were opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1983. The area had previously consisted of the smaller Town Hall Gardens, and the site of Croydon's police station. The Town Hall Gardens had originally been laid out in the 1890s on the site of the disused spur railway line leading to Croydon Central station. The gardens now comprise areas of lawn with standard trees, a central fountain with benches, and a sunken garden area with formal flower beds and trees exploiting the former track bed and station wall complete with original railings on top. Situated just across from Croydon's register office, the gardens are popular for wedding photographs. A subway exits the park under Park Lane into an underground car park and across to the Fairfield Halls: the gardens are regularly used as a route between the Council offices and the underpass. The cancelled Park Place development featured proposals to radically alter the Queen's Gardens, with a more formal and modern planting style, an ice rink, space for performances and entrance into the Park Place shopping centre.

Machale's Pendragon book series. The book takes place after The Rivers of Zadaa and was released on May 16, 2006 in Canada and the US. It was released on November 16, 2006 in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and in other countries. Setting The story takes place on a territory called Quillan, in the city of Rune, whose population live dreary lives under the rule of the megacorporation 'Blok'. Many people gamble on the eponymous games in hope of a better life; but may lose their lives, their families, or their professions if the bet fails. The games' celebrity players are called 'challengers', and often kill each other during the competition. Plot summary Like the other Pendragon books, The Quillan Games follows protagonist Bobby Pendragon's adventures on Quillan, while showing his friends Mark Dimond and Courtney Chetwynde on their home territory of Second Earth. Pendragon Upon arrival on Quillan, Bobby witnesses a fellow Traveler die in the games; but is soon captured by the android 'dados' of Quillan's police force, and recruited as a 'challenger' by the siblings LaBerge and Veego. He is also befriended by another Traveler, Nevva Winter, who explains the social situation. Subsequently, antagonist Saint Dane offers a 'secret' of the Travelers to Bobby, in exchange for Bobby's participation in the Grand X, an upcoming series of games. Bobby initially refuses; but is persuaded to join the Grand X by a secret society of 'revivers' bent on overthrowing Blok. Before this competition, Bobby learns that LaBerge and Veego originated the territory of Veelox, but were taken to Quillan by Saint Dane, and later shown Eelong, Cloral, and Zadaa from which they derive the games' structure. Ultimately, Bobby wins the game and the support of the people, who revolt against Blok; but Nevva, secretly in league with Saint Dane, reveals the revivers' archive 'Mr. Pop' to the dados, who suppress the rebellion. In leaving Quillan, Bobby encounters Nevva's mother, Elli Winter, who assumes the position of Traveler. Mark and Courtney Courtney recovers from near-fatal injuries inflicted by Saint Dane, while Mark studies science with Andy Mitchell, a former school bully, with whom he invents \\"Forge\\", a mechanized polymer capable of assuming geometric shapes on command. En route to witness the display thereof in Florida, Mark's parents are killed by the collapse of their aircraft, and Mark flees to another territory. Courtney, investigating this, discovers Saint Dane, who identifies Andy Mitchell as an alter-ego of his own, and returns her to Second Earth. There,Courtney discovers a lifelike robotic cat, and an unusually-advanced computer. When Bobby returns to Second Earth, he and Courtney discover these technologies trademarked 'Dimond Alpha Digital Organization'. Suspecting this name to derive from Mark's own, they also realize that the initials spell the word DADO, the name of the robot police on Quillan. Hoping to discover the precise changes made in Earth's history, they embark for Third Earth, concluding the book. '''''Characters in \\"The Quillan Games'''''\\" *Bobby Pendragon: Pendragon s the lead Traveler from Second Earth. He becomes a member of the revival and also becomes Challenger Red in this book. *Saint Dane: Saint Dane is the antagonist of the story. He said to Bobby if he competed in the Quillan Games, he will tell him the truth about the Travelers.He acted as a Blok Trustee Mr. Kayto, and Challenger Green a competitor who competed in the Quillan Games. At the end of the book he revealed a mysterious event he called \\"The Convergence\\". *Nevva Winter: Nevva is the biological daughter of Elli Winter. She pretends to be Traveler but she betrays them after Nevva had destroy Mr. Pop.

A commemorative plaque marks the place where Oskar Barnack first tested his Ur-Leica in Wetzlar. A replica of the first Leica camera, the Ur-Leica, developed by Oskar Barnack. This replica is on display at the company's headquarters in Wetzlar, Germany.Leica I, 1927, invented by Oskar Barnack Oskar Barnack (Nuthe- Urstromtal, Brandenburg, 1 November 1879 ‚Äì Bad Nauheim, Hesse, 16 January 1936) was an inventor and German photographer who built, in 1913, what would later become the first commercially successful 35mm still-camera, subsequently called Ur-Leica at Ernst Leitz Optische Werke (the Leitz factory) in Wetzlar. Life and career Barnack was an engineer at the Leitz company and suffered from asthma, so he proposed reducing the size and weight of cameras in order to be able to take photographs in his travels. In 1924 the camera was named Leica, an anagram obtained from Leitz Camera. It was released at the Leipzig Fair in 1925. Between 1913 and 1914, Barnack adapted 35 mm cinematic film for still-camera use with a larger negative than other 35mm cameras. The pronged- film rollers holding the perforated film allowed more precision than typical paper-backed roll film. His design was revolutionary because he transported the film horizontally, allowing an extended frame size to 24√ó36 mm with a 2:3 aspect ratio, instead of the 18x24 mm of cameras that carried the film vertically. Negatives in this small format could be enlarged to obtain sharper positive images. For this to be effective, the camera also needed a high- quality lens capable of producing the larger format film's quality. Barnack tried various types of lenses, trying to find the best quality images. At the time, lenses for existing 35mm cameras covered the 18√ó24 mm frame format, so the larger Leica frame size was only partially covered. Existing Leitz and competing Zeiss lenses were either too large for the camera or would not cover the 24x36 frame. To achieve the necessary resolution for a satisfactory enlargement, the 24x36 mm format needed a specially designed lens. Leica's first suitable lens was a 50 mm f/3.5 design based on the \\"Cooke triplet\\"; this would later evolve into the famous Leica Elmar series of lenses. In 1923 Barnack convinced his boss, Ernst Leitz II, to make a series of 31 pre- production cameras for the factory and for outdoor photographers. Although the prototypes received a mixed reception, Ernst Leitz decided in 1924 to produce the camera. It was a success when presented at the Spring Fair of Leipzig in 1925 as the Leica I (Leitz camera). Barnack was also one of the first photographers to create news images in which people's relationship to their surroundings could be seen. In this style, he made the first news image made with a 35 mm camera, showing the flood caused by the Lahn River in Wetzlar. In 1979, on the occasion of the centenary of its birth, the Leica Oskar Barnack Prize was awarded, endowed with 5000 euros, and awarded in July at the Meetings of Arles.

He wrote numerous arrangements (notably to Heel de wereld, the Dutch Eurovision Song Contest entry in 1958) and conducted De Zaaiers, one of the orchestras of Dutch radio, and many recordings on the Phonogram label until he left for South Africa in 1962. However, he may be best known for orchestrating the Indonesian national anthem Indonesia Raya. Biography=Child and student Cleber was born in Maastricht, the youngest of eight children in the Roman Catholic family of Gerardus Josephus Cleber, the organist and choir conductor at the Basilica of Saint Servatius, and Anna Maria Bastian. His father gave him his first music lessons. After high school, he attended the Maastricht Academy of Music, where he studied violin and piano, and at fifteen years old, he began playing viola with the Maastrichts Stedelijk Orkest. He later became fascinated by jazz and the music of Duke Ellington and thus chose to continue his studies at the Royal Conservatory of Li√®ge in saxophone and clarinet. There he was advised to study trombone instead, because his lips were thought to be well suited for it.Profile, huygens.knaw.nl; accessed 22 June 2015. Trombonist Cleber completed his obligatory military service early so that he could join the jazz orchestra of Paul Godwin. During a performance with Godwin in 1936, he received a commission to play with the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich, where he remained until 1939, when the threat of World War II became too great. He returned to the Netherlands and began playing violin and trombone for the Tuschinski Theatre, Amsterdam, under the direction of Max Tak. First marriage On 8 February 1939, he married Elisa Magdelijns (1917‚Äì2007), with whom he had a daughter, Yvonne Charlotte Cleber. The couple later divorced on 25 September 1951. World War II Cleber came into contact with AVRO, a Dutch public broadcaster, and in 1940, he joined their orchestra as a trombonist under the direction of Elzard Kuhlman. A year later, this orchestra became part of the Groot Amusementsorkest of the Nazi- organised Nederlandsche Omroep, and in 1942, by virtue of obligatory membership in the Nederlandsche Kultuurkamer, he became a trombonist in the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. During this time, he also continued his studies at the Conservatory of the Muzieklyceum Society in conducting, harmony, and counterpoint, receiving lessons from Kees van Baaren. After a meeting with Theo Uden Masman in May, 1945, Cleber joined Masman's dance orchestra De Ramblers, again as a trombonist. He continued playing with De Ramblers until 1945, when on the request of conductor Dolf van der Linden, he became a trombonist and arranger for the new Metropole Orkest. He remained with them until 1948, making several studio recordings with van der Linden, and at the same time, he led Selecta, his own ensemble of twelve musicians. Conductor In 1948, Cleber left the Netherlands to work for Radio Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, forming the Cosmopolitain Orkest. His wife and daughter followed later, but ultimately they divorced on 25 September 1951. Three months later, on 12 December 1951, he married Johanna Dirkje de Bruijn (born 1923), a cabareti√®re, in Jakarta. From this marriage, his second daughter, Karian, was born. Cleber returned to the Netherlands to share the direction of AVRO's theatre orchestra with Gerard van Krevelen. In 1952, he formed De Zaaiers, a pops orchestra, for AVRO, which with additional string players expanded to become a newly formed Cosmopolitain Orkest a year later. In 1957, his orchestra won the ‚ÄòGolden Gondola‚Äô in Venice. He also worked as an arranger not only for his own orchestra but also for the Metropole Orkest and Promenade Orkest. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Cleber also worked as a staff conductor for Phonogram, making recordings with Conny Stuart, Corry Brokken, Mieke Telkamp, Jules de Corte, and Willy Alberti, among others. From 1962-64, Cleber lived in South Africa, trying unsuccessfully to start a new orchestra in Johannesburg. While in South Africa, Cleber recorded a long playing record titled \\"Charls Segal's Compositions\\", featuring the compositions of South African pianist and composer Charles Segal. Cleber returned to conduct De Zaaiers and the Cosmopoitain Orkest until 1966, when AVRO dissolved them during a period of cost cutting. Jos Cleber kissed goodbye by Conny Stuart and Corry Brokken (1962) Producer Even after his orchestras had disbanded, Cleber was in demand for developing new musical talent. He remained at AVRO for two years as a music advisor, and from 1968 until his retirement in 1981, he produced the program Jonge mensen op weg naar het concertpodium. ComposerOrchestration of Indonesia Raya= In 1950, Jusuf Ronodipuro (then the Studio Head of Radio Republik Indonesia), requested that Cleber arrange Indonesia Raya for orchestra, upon which Cleber began a preliminary study on the history and actual impression the anthem intended to convey, and concluded that he sensed a Marseillaise impression in Indonesia Raya. Cleber's first arrangement was subsequently recorded in the RRI Studio, Central Jakarta, in early 1951, involving Cleber's orchestra and two other RRI orchestras. The initial response to the orchestration was warm and Cleber joined Ronodipuro to present the recording to President Sukarno. However, upon hearing it, Sukarno commented that the arrangement was too embellished. Sukarno wanted Indonesia Raya to be as majestic as the Dutch national anthem, Wilhelmus. Wilhelmus has a slow tempo (largo), whereas Indonesia Raya was intended to have a march tempo (Tempo di marcia), which led to Cleber's initial disagreement with the president over the orchestration. He began to work on the second arrangement, and the tempo was changed to Maestoso con bravura, (\\"majestically and with bravura\\"). Sukarno liked the second arrangement better; however he thought that there should be a part in the anthem that expresses beauty, softness, and sweetness, just prior to the climactic refrain. In the third arrangement, Cleber modified the verses right before the chorus to employ the string section, whereas the chorus itself was accompanied by the timpani, cymbal, and brass section. Sukarno considered this arrangement perfect and approved it.

The result of lowered motivation, in contrast with the predictions of neoclassical economics, can be an overall in the total performance. The term \\"crowding out\\" was coined by Bruno Frey in 1997, but the idea was first introduced into economics much earlier by Richard Titmuss, who argued in 1970 that offering financial incentives for certain behaviors could counter-intuitively lead to a drop in performance of those behaviors. While the empirical evidence supporting crowding out for blood donation has been mixed, there has since been a long line of psychological and economic exploration supporting the basic phenomenon of crowding out. The typical study of crowding out asks subjects to complete some task either for payment or no payment. Researchers then look to self-reported measures of motivation for completing the task, willingness to complete additional rounds of the task for no additional compensation, or both. Removing the payment incentive, compared to those who were never paid at all, typically lowers overall interest in and willingness to complete the task. This process is known as \\"crowding out\\" since whatever motivation for the task that previously existed‚Äîas estimated by the control condition that was not offered compensation for the task‚Äîhas been crowded out by motivation merely based on the payment. A 2020 study which reviewed more than a 100 tests of motivation crowding theory and conducted its own field experiments found that paying individuals for intrinsically enjoyable tasks boosts their performance, but that taking payment away after it is expected may lead individuals to perform worse than if they were not paid at first.  Development of the theory = History  According to research on operant conditioning and behaviorism in the 1950s, extrinsic rewards should increase the chances of the rewarded behavior occurring, with the greatest effect on behavior if the reward is given immediately after the behavior. In these studies, often removing the reward quickly led to a return to the pre-reward baseline frequency of the behavior. These findings led to popular calls for the adoption of incentives as motivational tools in a variety of professional and educational contexts. Moreover, according to standard economics, providing extrinsic incentives for a behavior has an immediate relative-price effect which should produce more of that behavior by making that behavior more attractive. Literature in economics has myriad examples of this. However, Titmuss argued that sometimes adding incentives can actually diminish the rewarded behavior. Exploring this idea, Edward Deci noticed in the early 1970s that some actions appear to provide their own reward. These behaviors are described as being intrinsically motivated, and their enjoyment or rewards come from the act of engaging in the task itself. In this case, behavior does not require any extrinsic reward. These observations led researchers to ask how providing extrinsic rewards for a given activity would influence intrinsic motivation toward that activity. While the relative-price effect would predict that rewards should only enhance the attractiveness of the behavior, there appeared to be indirect psychological effects of offering extrinsic incentives that, in some cases, have the opposite effect of making the behavior seem less attractive.  Experimental manipulations  Dependent measures = A wide range of behaviors has been investigated for crowding out, including completion of rote tasks, engagement with interesting puzzles, pro-social favors, creative art projects, and more. Crowding out is typically measured in two ways. First, crowding out is measured as self-reported interest in the activity after an incentive has been provided. Second, crowding out can be measured by engagement in the activity while subjects believe the experiment has ended and after full compensation has been provided. Some studies use both measures. In some cases, crowding out has been found to directly affect effort and performance on the target behavior itself even while compensated for performance. For instance, paying people a token amount of money to raise money for charity has been shown to cause people to wind up collecting less money than those who were not paid at all. = Independent variables = According to a meta-analysis, three kinds of rewards are used in the investigation of crowding out. First, task-noncontingent rewards, such as show-up fees, are offered to subjects independent of task performance or completion, simply as compensation for their time. These rewards are not expected to displace intrinsic motivation. Second, task-contingent rewards, on the other hand, are incentives on the quantity, quality, or completion of some specific behavior (e.g. solving word puzzles or collecting charitable donations). Crowding out is thought to be most significant in this case. Finally, performance-contingent rewards, incentives for achieving certain outcomes, are thought to create comparatively little crowding out because they can serve as a signal of status and achievement rather than tampering with motivation.  Early evidence  Volunteer firefighters serve alongside paid professionals in many communities. Motivation crowding theory posits that these two kinds of firefighters might perform differently based on how they are paid. Early research in this area in the 1970s found that providing an extrinsic incentive for completing a task could undermine intrinsic motivation and subsequent effort devoted to that task across a broad range of contexts. This research considered the effect of monetary, tangible (e.g. gifts), and symbolic rewards among young children, college students, and adults doing a wide variety of tasks. In a classic study, Deci paid all subjects for participation in a psychological experiment that involved solving multiple puzzles or IQ test questions. Half of the subjects were paid a flat fee just for showing up to the experiment, but the other half of subjects were informed that they would be paid per their completion of the study's tasks. After the presumptive experiment was over, subjects were left with free time during which they could either sit idly or complete more tasks. Deci measured the number of additional IQ questions or puzzles completed during this non- compensated time as well as self-reported measurements of interest in the task. Deci found that, compared to those who were paid simply for showing up, subjects who were paid specifically to complete the tasks were significantly less likely to complete additional non-compensated tasks and gave lower ratings of interest levels in the tasks themselves. Deci interpreted these findings to suggest that motivation for and interest in the tasks had been displaced by the provision of extrinsic incentives. These studies typically find that if incentives are large then, once removed, they can have long-run crowding out effects. However, more recent research has found that even if workers find incentives to be insufficient then there can be short-run crowding out of the rewarded behavior too. Examples of early crowding out studies include: * In a pioneering study, Deci had college students attempt to solve a puzzle game called a Soma cube. During Phase I of the experiment, all subjects had the opportunity to play with the cube and attempt to solve several puzzles. During Phase II, half of the subjects (control) repeated Phase I whereas the other half of subjects were paid $1 for each puzzle they could solve. During Phase III, no one was paid but experimenters interrupted participants in the middle of the session, telling them a cover story about why the experimenter needed to leave the room for a few minutes. Secretly, experimenters were able to observe how participants spent their free time. Deci found that those who had been paid during Phase II were significantly less likely to play with the cube during the free, uncompensated time during Phase III. * In a follow-up study that replicated the basic pattern of results from 1971, Deci later found that offering verbal praise as a reward for task completion did not have a similar backfiring effect as offering a monetary reward had. * Kruglanski et al. found that if high school students were promised an extrinsic incentive before engaging in a variety of tasks, the students showed less creativity and subsequently reported enjoying the task less compared to those who were not promised payment at the outset. * Lepper et al. found that children who were told that they would receive a reward in exchange for drawing‚Äîsomething they had previously shown to be intrinsically interested in‚Äîsubsequently became less interested in drawing after the reward was given, compared to those who received a reward unexpectedly or who received no reward at all. Other research has shown that a similar effect of crowding out can occur from negative disincentives for behavior, too. For instance, economic studies have shown that increasing penalties can actually lower obedience with the law and decrease worker performance. While all of these early investigations demonstrated that providing extrinsic incentives could undermine motivation for the rewarded behavior, researchers had not yet established the psychological process involved that could explain this consistent pattern of results.  Psychological theories  Various explanations have been offered for why crowding out occurs.  Motivational theories  On this view‚Äîsometimes referred to as cognitive evaluation theory‚Äîthe post-behavioral significance people assign to the reward determines subsequent motivation. Deci and Ryan argue that rewards can be seen to have two components: one that controls people's behavior and thus infringes on their autonomy, and a different, status-signaling component that enhances people's sense of competence. For instance, an employee recognition award could be seen as either the reason why an employee worked so hard in a given month (i.e. to win the award) or could be seen simply as a recognition of the employee's performance in general. If an extrinsic reward for some behavior appears to be controlling (i.e. the reason a person plausibly performed that behavior), this is argued to supplant intrinsic motivation for engaging in the behavior. Insofar, however, as the extrinsic incentive is seen not as an inducement but rather as a signal of high status or high achievement in general (e.g. a merit-based award), the incentive will engender more effort without crowding out motivation. On this account, then, the extent to which a given extrinsic incentive crowds out motivation is determined by the balance of the controlling versus status-signaling nature of the awards as perceived by the actor.  Attributional theories  The application of self- perception theory to motivation suggests that people sometimes form post- behavior judgments about the causes of their actions by considering the external circumstances of their decision. While intrinsic motivation for doing the activity might be a cause, the presence of an extrinsic reward could also be sufficient for explaining a behavior. The overjustification account of motivational crowding, most prominently advanced by Lepper et al., argues that people recognize the presence of a significant extrinsic incentive, attribute their motivation for doing the rewarded activity to the reward itself, and consequently lower their feelings of intrinsic motivation toward the activity. Thus, they infer, if effort for engaging in a task becomes too onerous or if an extrinsic reward is removed, people feel less internally motivated to engage in the task compared to those who were never offered a reward for doing so.  Behavioral theories  Various attempts have been made by behaviorists to explain the apparent phenomenon of crowding out in terms of reward conditioning. Behaviors that are typically thought to be intrinsically motivated, these theories argue, are actually motivated by the social praise they tend to engender. Dickinson argues that part of the reason why these behaviors are socially praised is precisely because they are not connected with any particular reinforcers. When a person helps someone else, he argues, he receives praise in part because there does not seem to be any specific private incentive for doing helping. Thus, the introduction of a specific reinforcer such as an extrinsic reward lowers the public praise, Dickinson argues. If the loss of praise is larger than the size of the specific reinforcer, she argues, then free-choice selection of that behavior will decrease. Hence, what appears as crowding out of intrinsic motivation can instead be explained, according to these theories, by shifting perceptions and incentives.  Economic utility theories  Some have argued that certain utility functions can be modeled to explain crowding out. B√©nabou and Tirole, for instance, have theoretically established that crowding out can reliably occur if an agent's utility function for some behavior is composed of three things: intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and image-signaling concerns. = Signals to actors = In a context of uncertainty or information asymmetry, rewards can signal important information to the actor. If the person offering the reward (the \\"principal\\") is presumed to know something more about the task than the person to engage in the activity (the \\"agent\\"), then offering an extrinsic reward can be seen as revealing the principal's distrust as to whether or not the action would be taken without the inducement. In this view, offering a reward is a signal that either the principal knows the task is unpleasant and otherwise would not be completed, or that the principal does not trust that the agent is sufficiently motivated without such incentives. On either interpretation, agents are understood to infer something negative about the activity which lowers their willingness to engage in it without additional incentive. An implication of this view is that, under certain conditions, crowding in might occur. If an activity were valued poorly by an agent, an especially high premium offered might signal to the agent that this task is more valuable than the agent previously considered. = Signals to observers about actors' motivations = Additionally, the presence or absence of extrinsic incentives can be interpreted by observers as signals of an agent's motivations for engaging in some activity. To the extent that agents are concerned with cultivating an image as an altruist, the presence of extrinsic incentives can lower interest in engaging in some task that might signal non-altruistic motives. Compatible with these findings are studies showing that the effect of crowding out is greater in the case when extrinsic incentives are known publicly compared to when they are known only to the actor but not to observers.  Debate and meta-analyses  Controversy was ignited when some researchers questioned whether the data support claims that motivation crowding actually occurs. Meta-analyses revealed mixed or even null overall effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. However, these meta-analyses have been questioned, especially for their treatment of dependent measures and failure to account for moderating variables (e.g. the kind of reward or class of dependent measure). Other meta-analyses have concluded that, once these factors are properly controlled for, motivation crowding for certain behaviors is a robust effect for certain kinds of rewards. Through the debate, consensus seems to have emerged that crowding out reliably occurs if the following conditions are met: * Rewards are offered in the context of pre-existing intrinsic motivation (e.g. in a pro-social setting or for interesting tasks). * Rewards are known in advance and expected. * Rewards are tangible.  Applications  People have proposed using the insights of motivational crowding theory to change reward structures at work, in schools, for government policies, non-profits, and at home. The basic phenomenon of incentives undermining motivation, effort, and output has been demonstrated in populations of children, college students, adults, and workers, both in the lab and in the field. Crowding out has been shown to occur in teacher performance-based pay, temporary workers' effort in commission-based pay structures, charitable giving, and student scholastic performance. The collection of this evidence has led some economists to call for rethinking how governments and charitable organizations that rely on volunteers use incentives and pay-for-performance schemes.

The structure in the nebula is among the most complex ever observed in planetary nebulae. The spectrum of NGC 6302 shows that its central star is one of the hottest stars known, with a surface temperature in excess of 250,000 degrees Celsius, implying that the star from which it formed must have been very large. The central star, a white dwarf, was identified in 2009, using the upgraded Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. The star has a current mass of around 0.64 solar masses. It is surrounded by a dense equatorial disc composed of gas and dust. This dense disc is postulated to have caused the star's outflows to form a bipolar structure similar to an hourglass. This bipolar structure shows features such as ionization walls, knots and sharp edges to the lobes. Observation history Position of NGC 6302 As it is included in the New General Catalogue, this object has been known since at least 1888.Many sources credit its discovery to James Dunlop in 1826. E.g. (1) Wolfgang Steinicke, Nebel und Sternhaufen: Geschichte ihrer Entdeckung, Beobachtung und Katalogisierung- von Herschel bis Dreyers, 2009, p. 429. (2) Universe Today; (3) Stephen James O'Meara, The Caldwell objects. Cambridge University Press, 2002, p.274.. (O'Meara argues that Barnard credited it to Dunlop‚Äîbut may have been mistaken.) The earliest-known study of NGC 6302 is by Edward Emerson Barnard, who drew and described it in 1907. The nebula featured in some of the first images released after the final servicing mission of the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2009.News Release Number: STScI-2009-25: Hubble Opens New Eyes on the Universe Characteristics NGC 6302 has a complex structure, which may be approximated as bipolar with two primary lobes, though there is evidence for a second pair of lobes that may have belonged to a previous phase of mass loss. A dark lane runs through the waist of the nebula obscuring the central star at all wavelengths. The nebula contains a prominent northwest lobe which extends up to 3.0‚Ä≤ away from the central star and is estimated to have formed from an eruptive event around 1,900 years ago. It has a circular part whose walls are expanding such that each part has a speed proportional to its distance from the central star. At an angular distance of 1.71‚Ä≤ from the central star, the flow velocity of this lobe is measured to be 263 km/s. At the extreme periphery of the lobe, the outward velocity exceeds 600 km/s. The western edge of the lobe displays characteristics suggestive of a collision with pre-existing globules of gas which modified the outflow in that region. Central star The central star, among the hottest stars known, had escaped detection because of a combination of its high temperature (meaning that it radiates mainly in the ultraviolet), the dusty torus (which absorbs a large fraction of the light from the central regions, especially in the ultraviolet) and the bright background from the star. It was not seen in the first Hubble Space Telescope images; the improved resolution and sensitivity of the new Wide Field Camera 3 of the same telescope later revealed the faint star at the centre. A temperature of 200,000 Kelvin is indicated, and a mass of 0.64 solar masses. The original mass of the star was much higher, but most was ejected in the event which created the planetary nebula. The luminosity and temperature of the star indicate it has ceased nuclear burning and is on its way to becoming a white dwarf, fading at a predicted rate of 1% per year. Dust chemistry The prominent dark lane that runs through the centre of the nebula has been shown to have an unusual composition, showing evidence for multiple crystalline silicates, crystalline water ice and quartz, with other features which have been interpreted as the first extra-solar detection of carbonates. This detection has been disputed, due to the difficulties in forming carbonates in a non-aqueous environment. The dispute remains unresolved. One of the characteristics of the dust detected in NGC 6302 is the existence of both oxygen-bearing silicate molecules and carbon-bearing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Stars are usually either oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, the change from the former to the latter occurring late in the evolution of the star due to nuclear and chemical changes in the star's atmosphere. NGC 6302 belongs to a group of objects where hydrocarbon molecules formed in an oxygen-rich environment. .

He was born in Biala, completed high school in Teschen in 1867, and studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig. He earned a doctorate in astronomy in 1872 from the latter, studying under Carl Christian Bruhns. He was on the staff of the University of Bonn Observatory until 1877, as an assistant to Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. In 1874, he directed the German expedition to the Auckland Islands to observe the transit of Venus. In 1881, he became the Director of the Gotha Observatory, and in 1882 became a Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at the University of Munich, which post he held until his death. His students included Hans Kienle, Ernst Anding, Julius Bauschinger, Paul ten Bruggencate, Gustav Herglotz, Richard Schorr, and especially Karl Schwarzschild, who earned a doctorate under him in 1898, and acknowledged Seeliger's influence in speeches throughout his career. Seeliger was elected an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1892, and President of the Astronomische Gesellschaft from 1897 to 1921. He received numerous honours and medals, including knighthood (Ritter), between 1896 and 1917. His contributions to astronomy include an explanation of the anomalous motion of the perihelion of Mercury (later one of the main tests of general relativity), a theory of nova coming from the collision of a star with a cloud of gas, and his confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell's theories of the composition of the rings of Saturn by studying variations in their albedo. He is also the discoverer of an apparent paradox in Newton's gravitational law, known as Seeliger's Paradox. However his main interest was in the stellar statistics of the Bonner Durchmusterung and Bonn section of the Astronomische Gesellschaft star catalogues, and in the conclusions these led about the structure of the universe. Seeliger's views on the dimensions of our galaxy were consistent with Jacobus Kapteyn's later studies. He continued his work until his death, on 2 December 1924, aged 75. The asteroid 892 Seeligeria and the lunar crater Seeliger were named in his honour. The brightening of Saturn's rings at opposition is known as the Seeliger Effect, to acknowledge his pioneering research in this field. Minor planet 251 Sophia is named after his wife, Sophia.

He is among the best-known Christian musicians in Canada and is an accomplished songwriter and record producer. Before embarking on his solo career he was a long-time member of the group Elias, Schritt and Bell. In 1989, Bell founded the independent recording label Signpost Music along with Dave Zeglinski, long-time friend and co- producer. His first solo album, Comfort My People, was released on Signpost that same year. Bell now has twenty albums to his credit. Among his many awards are two Junos, several GMA Canada Covenant Awards and the 2012 Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.  Musical career  Steve Bell has been performing music since childhood. His recording career began at 13 when his family's gospel band, The Alf Bell Family Singers, recorded an LP. The album contains some of his earliest songwriting. After graduating from high school he was a member of a succession of bands playing a number of different musical genres. For three years he played with the secular folk trio Elias, Schritt and Bell, along with Tim Elias and John Schritt. The group released one commercial studio album, Awakening, in 1982. Bell quit the band and performed with various artists (Rocki Rolletti, Rhonda Hart, Byron O'Donnell, Bob King) until 1988 when he withdrew from performing. It was during this period that his childhood Christian faith became reanimated and over a six-month period wrote most of the material for his first four solo projects.Emusic Canada review. Retrieved September 27, 2008. Faced with a lack of interest from established labels he formed the Indie record label Signpost Music in 1989 and released his first solo album. The first edition of Comfort My People comprised 300 Cassettes.Signpost Village. Retrieved September 6, 2008. Bell has gone on to release twenty solo albums, selling over 400,000 copies independently. His tours have taken him all over North America and the world (2000+ concerts). In 1994 Signpost Music received a boost when Bell became business partners with his co-producer Dave Zeglinski. Bell was the Juno Awards' first winner in the Best Gospel Album category in 1998. That category was created from the former Blues/Gospel Album category, which represented the industry's recognition of Contemporary Christian Music in Canada. Since then, Bell has gone on to release 20 albums, 4 concert DVDs, 5 songbooks, a co- authored book on the Psalms, and a 7-book series on the Christian calendar called Pilgrim Year. His work has earned him two JUNOs, four Western Canadian Music Awards, three Prairie Music Awards, eleven Gospel Music Association Covenant Awards (including Male Vocalist of the Year, Recorded Song of the Year, Album of the Year, and the 2018 Lifetime Achievement Award), and many more nominations. He has won three Word Awards for his poetry, song lyrics, and magazine articles. Bell's most recent feature-length album, Where the Good Way Lies (released on LP and DVD) included collaborations with local Indigenous singers Ray ‚ÄúCoco‚Äù Stevenson and Fresh I.E., was nominated for a 2017 JUNO Award for Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year. In 2006 Bell was invited to perform with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra. Scores were created by jazz pianist and composer Mike Janzen. Since then, Bell has performed 30 sold-out or capacity-crowd concerts with symphonies across Canada and the United States. Bell's concert DVD, Steve Bell in Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, won a 2009 International Christian Visual Media Gold Crown Award for Best Music Video.2009 Crown Award Winners at International Christian Visual Media . Retrieved November 29, 2009. For his \\"skill, his musicality, for his connection with the symphony, and for his openness\\" Steve was awarded the Winnipeg Symphony Golden Baton Award in 2013. In 2014, Bell was the subject of a documentary by Refuge31 Films entitled Burning Ember: The Steve Bell Journey, for which a film crew followed Steve across North America to chronicle the many ups and downs of life in the music industry. The documentary has won numerous awards and has been broadcast in Canada (CBC's Documentary Channel) and worldwide. Advocacy Amidst his regular touring schedule, Bell has worked on behalf of aid organizations such as World Vision, Compassion Canada, and the Canadian Foodgrains Bank. His advocacy efforts have helped raise awareness and significant financial support. A close association with the National Roundtable on Homelessness and Poverty has helped draw attention to the plight of Canada's marginalized. Having traveled extensively in the Third World, Bell spreads hope via his music and message to communities in India, Thailand, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Palestine, Kenya, Guatemala, and many other countries. In recent years, Bell has used his platform to advocate for the building of Freedom Road, a 27-kilometre road that ended a century of isolation for the people of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation. He has also been a strong voice urging the Canadian government to adopt Bill C-262, an act that would ensure that Canadian laws are in harmony with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Bell's \\"effort for the sake of Indigenous communities\\" which has \\"brought together many Indigenous, church, political and other groups of people, including students,\\" was a major impetus for Canadian Mennonite University's selection of him as their 2018 CMU PAX Award recipient.

PFC Naftex Burgas () is a former football club from Burgas, Bulgaria. History The club was created in 1962 by a group of workers, laying the foundations of the future Petroleum Refinery Neftochim, which had not yet been named. The team start–µd in A regional group under the name of Stroitel. The team's first- ever friendly game was against Lokomotiv Burgas. In 1964 the Refinery was finally named Neftochim and the team's name was also changed to Neftochimic. In 1965 the team earned its promotion to 2nd Bulgarian division. In its first game in 2nd division, on September 9, 1965, the team played in front of a crowd of 8000 fans. The team players at the time were workers from the refinery, who had been training daily after hours. 1965 was the year when the construction of the new official stadium of the team commenced. The stadium was completed in 1967 and was named \\"Neftochimic Stadium\\" (\\"–°—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–Ω –ù–µ—Ñ—Ç–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∫\\"). The first-ever game played at the stadium was the game between the under-21 teams of Bulgaria and Finland. The primary reason for the stadium construction was to host the home games of Neftochimic. In 1969, after an ill- advised decision by the ruling communist party in Bulgaria, to form a unified Burgas team that would gather the best football players in town, FC Neftochimic was disbanded and the best players of the team left to join the other local team ‚Äì Chernomorets. From 1969 to 1981 Neftochimic remained a lower tier club, involved in workers' championships only. The stadium in complex Lazur, however, was still frequented by the same enthusiastic crowd of fans that had supported the team during its years in second division. During those days, the local rival team ‚Äì FC Chernomorec ‚Äì tried on numerous occasions to \\"steal\\" Neftochimic's stadium. At the time FC Chernomorec was a member of Bulgaria's elite division, but it played its home games at a place called \\"Kolodruma\\" which did not suit the team's ambitions. The directors of the \\"Neftochim\\" refinery, however, managed to retain ownership of the stadium by creating an inter-refinery workers' championship that was hosted at the stadium. For a period of 12 years Neftochimic was wiped off the map of Bulgarian football. On May 6, 1981, after the stadium of second division club Lokomotiv Burgas (created 1932) was destroyed to leave space for a railway expansion, Lokomotiv decided to merge into FC Neftochimic and start playing its home games at \\"Neftochimic\\" stadium. That brought Neftochimic back into professional football and the official name of the team became DSF Neftochimic. The new team was officially registered on January 29, 1986 and this is what has caused a lot of confusion later and is the main source of the misconception that the team has been in existence since 1986 only. The newly formed team started its first season in second division, where Lokomotiv had been playing before the merger. The Portochanov Era (1990‚Äì2004) Neftochimic played in the lower divisions in the first four years of the existences of the team. In 1990, Hristo Portochanov took charge of the administration of the club. In his first year as a president, he began the reconstruction of the Neftochimic Stadium and by the year 1997 the stadium was transformed into the best football stadium in Bulgaria and among the best on the Balkan Peninsula. In 1993, Dimitar Dimitrov signed as a manager of the team and it won the Bulgarian Eastern B PFG and qualifies in the Bulgarian top division for the first time in its history. Neftochimic finished at 8th place in its first season and reached the semifinals of the Bulgarian Cup eliminating champions Levski Sofia on its way. The second season in the Bulgarian A PFG was among the most successful season in the history of the club. Neftochimic finished 4th and won the Professional League Cup. In 1997, PFC Neftochimic finished second after a series of referee's mistakes in favor of champions CSKA Sofia and won again the Professional League Cup. In the following years, Neftochimic established itself as one of the best teams in the country regularly finishing in places allowing the team to participate in the UEFA Cup. In 2000‚Äì01 season Neftochimic eliminated AC Omonia Cyprus with 2:1 on aggregate, but later was defeated by Lokomotiv Moscow ‚Äì 0:0 and 2:4. Difficult Years (2004‚Äì2009) In year 2004, Portochanov resigned as a president of Naftex and the club began experiencing serious troubles. Many of the very strong and experienced players that brought success to Naftex were sold and the new management managed the club carelessly allowing it to fall out of the Bulgarian A PFG in 2006. From 2006 PFC Naftex is a satellite of PFC Chernomorets. On July 6, 2009, the club is folded. On the next day ‚Äì July 7 an amateur football club called \\"Athletic\\" was renamed to Neftochimic 1986 and was declared by its new owners as successor of the old team. Stadium Lazur Stadium in Burgas was the home stadium of PFC Neftochimic. The stadium is currently used by –ü–§–ö ‚Äû–ù–µ—Ñ—Ç–æ—Ö–∏–º–∏–∫ 1962‚Äú. It has 18,037 seats and a great training and fitness base. It is located in the Lazur complex near the sea garden in Burgas. The stadium has great facilities and has hosted several international games of the Bulgarian national football team. Litex Lovech and Lokomotiv Plovdiv have also played a number of their games for the continental competitions in Burgas. Lazur Stadium's capacity of 18,037 seats was quite outnumbered in the past by eventually reaching up to 25,000 in derby games between domestic Naftex and leading teams from the country.

Biography ZunzG. V. pp. 293 et seq. inferred from Tobiah's reference to his father as \\"the great\\" and from his mention of the massacre in Mainz in 1096, that he was a native of Mainz and a son of Eliezer ben Isaac ha-Gadol, who is thought by David Conforte·∏≤ore ha-Dorot, p. 8b to have been one of Rashi's teachers. But as in the course of his work Tobiah often attacks the Karaites and, besides, manifests a thorough knowledge of Muslim customs, Samuel Judah L√∂b RapoportIn his biography of Eleazer Kalir, note 33 (in Bikkure ha-'Ittim, x. 122-123) concluded that toward the end of his life Tobiah settled in the Land of Israel. As to Tobiah's birthplace, it has been proved by Solomon Buber that he was a native of Kastoria at that time in Bulgaria, as is testified to by Tobiah's countryman Judah Leon Mosconi in his supercommentary on Ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch. According to him, the author of the commentary on the Pentateuch mentioned by Ibn Ezra in the preface to his own work was a certain Me√Ør of Castoria, a pupil of Tobiah b. Eliezer. On the other hand, in his commentary on Ecclesiastes, Tobiah mentions a R. Samson as his teacher; and Buber supposes that he may be identical with the Samson quoted by Rashi in his commentary on Isaiah 58:14 and Amos 6:3. It is also to be concluded from various dates given in Lekach Tov that he wrote it in 1097 and revised it in 1107 or 1108. Lekach Tov=Name Tobiah himself entitled his work \\"Lekach Tov\\" in allusion to his name Tobiah; and it is so cited by the earlier rabbis.e.g., Ibn Ezra (l.c.), Asheri (in Hilkot Tefillin), Zedekiah ben Abraham (Shibbole ha-Le·∏≥e·π≠ ¬ß118), and many others Since the mid-16th century, however, it has been most often referred to as Pesikta Zutarta (= \\"the Lesser Pesikta\\") in distinction to the Pesikta Rabbati (= \\"the Greater Pesikta\\"). This second title was because the editors of the part relating to Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy (Venice, 1546), found no title in the manuscript, but noted that every verse was headed ◊§◊° \\"piska\\", and took it for granted that it was entitled Pesikta. Consequently, the rimed title which, Zunz (l.c.) thinks, was composed by the press-corrector Johanan Treves begins ◊§◊°◊ô◊ß◊™◊ê ◊ñ◊ï◊ò◊®◊™◊ê ◊ê◊ï ◊®◊ë◊™◊ê (\\"Pesikta, be it small or great\\"). In the colophon the editors call it \\"Pesikta Zutarta.\\" It was owing to the latter title that Lekach Tov was confused with the Pesikta Rabbati by Gedaliah ibn Ya·∏•ya,Shalshelet ha-·∏≤abbalah, p. 24b, Amsterdam, 1697 J. Heilprin,Seder ha-Dorot, i. Azariah dei Rossi,Me'or 'Enayim, ch. 19 and others. Characteristics In the commentary, Every weekly parsha is introduced by a Biblical verse containing the word \\"·π≠ob.\\" Moreover, in the text he very often says, \\"I, Tobiah b. Eliezer\\" or \\"Tobiah said.\\" It is true that in the Jerusalem manuscript there occurs very often the expression \\"our teacher Tobiah b. Eliezer,\\" from which it might be assumed that Lekach Tov was written by Tobiah's pupils; but from a closer examination of the text, and to judge from the Florence manuscript, it is evident that the expression in question is merely a copyist's mistake. Lekach Tov covers the whole Pentateuch and the Five Megillot. It is in reality half a simple (\\"pesha·π≠\\") commentary, giving the grammatical meaning of the words, and half aggadah. But in many instances Tobiah declares that the standard interpretation is the simple one. Even in his aggadic interpretation, which he derives from the Talmud and from the pre-Talmudic and post-Talmudic literatures, Tobiah manifests his love of good style. He endeavors to arrange the various midrashim in perfect order and to edit them in few words and clear language. He therefore shortens the midrashic passages, and, instead of the Aramaic in which those passages were written, renders them into good Hebrew, omitting also the foreign words which occur in the midrashim. In the parts of the Pentateuch which deal with the commandments he inserts many halakhot, apparently taken from various halakhic collections, particularly from Achai Gaon's She'eltot. The Talmudic passages which he cites in connection with the halakhot he often interprets according to his own judgment and differently from Rashi. Throughout the whole commentary Tobiah shows his thorough knowledge of Hebrew grammar and his acquaintance with the works of the earlier grammarians. Incidentally it may be remarked that he seems to have held the opinion that the Hebrew roots are not necessarily triliteral. In certain places he interprets a Biblical word as though it were a mishnaic or Talmudic one. He considers there is not a letter too many or too few in the whole Pentateuch; and he bases many of his aggadic interpretations on the Qere and Ketiv. One of the main features of his commentary is the allegorical interpretation of all the Biblical passages which speak of God as a corporeal being. He likewise considers that the expressions in R. Ishmael's Heikhalot must be taken figuratively.see Lekach Tov on Deuteronomy 4:12 In many places he refutes assertions of the Karaites, though he does not expressly name their authors. Like many other Biblical commentators, he translates certain words into the language of the country in which he is living, namely, Greek).. Sources Tobiah seldom mentions the sources for his commentary; but they are found to be as follows: Targum of Onqelos; Baraita of R. Ishmael; Baraita of R. Eliezer ben Jose ha-Gelili; Sifra; Sifre; Mekhilta; Seder Olam; Sefer Ye·∫ìirah; the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmud; Genesis Rabbah; a midrash on the blessing of Jacob;Jellinek, \\"B. H.\\" iii. 73 et seq. Leviticus Rabbah; midrash on the Five Megillot; Tanchuma; Yelammedenu; Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer; Baraita di-Meleket ha-Mishkan; Aggadat Mashia·∏•; Heikhalot of R. Ishmael; Sefer ha-Yashar; Midrash Abkir; Midrash Hashkem; and many other midrashim. It seems that he utilized the She'eltot of R. Achai, the Halakot Gedolot, and the Yosippon. He quotes also Eleazar ha-·∏≤alir, Saadia, Hai Gaon, Shabbethai Donnolo, Ben Asher, Ben Naphtali, and his teacher R. Samson, while he cites passages from Menahem ben Saruk and Moses ha-Darshan without mentioning their names. Influence Tobiah is in turn quoted by those of Rashi's pupils who redacted the Li·∏≥·∏≥u·π≠e ha-Pardes, and by the following: Menahem ben Solomon in his \\"Sekhel ·π¨ov\\"; Jacob Tam in his Sefer haYashar; RaSHBaM in his commentary on the Pentateuch; Ibn Ezra (see above); Tobiah ben Moses the Karaite in his Yehi Me'orot; Isaac ben Abba Mari in his Sefer haI·π≠·π≠ur; Isaac ben Moses in his Or Zarua; Zedekiah ben Abraham (see above); Judah ben Eliezer in his Min·∏•at Yehudah; Eliezer ben Nathan in his piyyut Lel Shimmurim; and numerous later Biblical commentators, halakhists, and Talmudists. It will thus be seen that Lekach Tov was considered as an authority by the German, French, and Italian, but not by the earlier Spanish, scholars. Of the latter Ibn Ezra alone mentions it, disparagingly. But later Spanish authorities who, after the expulsion, settled in the East considered Lekach Tov as the chief source for their works. Publication Only that part of Tobiah's work covering Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy was edited in Venice, 1546. The same part was afterward reedited with a Latin translation under the title \\"Pesikta\\" by Ugolino;In his Thesaurus Antiquitatum Sacrarum (xv.-xvi.) and was subsequently republished by Aaron Moses Padua under the title Midrash Lekach Tov (Wilna, 1880), with a short commentary or \\"bi'ur.\\" Four years later the part comprising Genesis and Exodus was published, also under the title Midrash Lekach Tov, by Solomon Buber (Wilna, 1884), who added a long introduction and copious notes. The commentary on Lamentations was edited by Nacht,\\"Tobiah b. Eliezer's Commentar zu Threni,\\" Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1895 and that on the Book of Ruth by Bamberger (Mainz, 1887). Poems Tobiah is known as a Hebrew poet through four poems of his which are still extant. One is an introduction to his commentary on Genesis, another is an epilogue to the same, both being acrostics on \\"Tobiah bar Eliezer ·∏§aza·∏≥\\"; a third is a short acrostic on \\"Tobiah,\\" forming an epilogue to Leviticus;and the remaining one is a \\"seli·∏•ah\\" beginning \\"Ehyeh asher Ehyeh,\\" the verses being arranged in alphabetical order, and signed \\"Tobiah b. Eliezer ·∏§aza·∏≥.\\" The last-cited poem has been published by Solomon Buber at the end of his introduction to Lekach Tov.

It is the largest library in the world devoted to the social sciences. The Library responds to around 6,500 visits from students and staff each day. In addition, it provides a specialist international research collection, serving over 12,000 registered external users each year. It is housed in the Lionel Robbins Building. Location The library is located on the London School of Economics (LSE) Campus, near Portugal Street. The current building is the former headquarters and warehouse facilities of WH Smith, opened in 1916 and taken over by LSE in 1976, to be reopened as a library in 1978. History The Library was founded in 1896, one year after the LSE. It was founded in order to \\"provide, for the serious student of administrative and constitutional problems, what has hitherto been lacking in this country, namely a collection of the materials for economic and political research\\". A history of its development and collections is available on its institutional repository, LSE Research Online. Formal opening of the new library in the Lionel Robbins Building, 1979  Collections  Since its foundation the library has been the national social sciences library of the United Kingdom, and collects material on a worldwide basis in all major European languages. Over 50 km of shelving, enough to stretch the length of the Channel Tunnel, houses over four and a half million items including 31,000 past and present journal titles. The Library subscribes to approximately 15,000 e-journals as part of its electronic information provision. It has been designated as a United Nations depository library, providing a comprehensive collection of UN publications and documents. Many other organisations are also represented, including OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), ILO (International Labour Organization), OAS (Organization of American States) and GATT/WTO (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade / World Trade Organization). It is also a European Documentation Centre and has received publications from the European Community since 1964. Its collections have been recognised for their national and international importance and awarded 'Designation' status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA). The library's archives hold a number of unique collections. These include Charles Booth's poverty maps, which were awarded UNESCO status in 2016 on the Memory of the World Register. It also holds a number of other archive collections of national or international significance, such as The Women's Library, LGBT activism, British politics and early left wing thought, and peace campaigning. The Library has a number of open access platforms to make its collections available freely online. These include a digital library which holds digitised items from its collections, LSE Theses Online, which holds PhDs recently completed at the LSE, LSE Research Online, which holds research outputs by LSE academic staff, LSE Press, with a focus on publishing the research of LSE authors, and Houghton Street Press, which publishes the work of LSE students. The Library holds a free exhibition space which showcases some of its unique collections, with three termly exhibitions each year. Redevelopment The Lionel Robbins Building, 1978 Inside the library, 2008 The library underwent a ¬£35 million building redevelopment in 2000, overseen by Foster and Partners. The building was officially reopened on 27 November 2001 by The Princess Royal and was commended in the 2002 Civic Trust Awards - given to outstanding examples of architecture and environmental design in major city areas of the UK, taking into account the benefit each project brings to its local area as well as the quality of its design. A further redevelopment in summer 2007, saw the expansion of the Course Collection by 60%, a new help desk, more study spaces and an increase in self-service facilities. The Lionel Robbins Building covers 20,000 square metres, and offers 1,700 study places, including 450 networked PCs and 226 laptop drop-in points. A light-filled atrium, named after Michael Peacock and spiral stepped ramp culminate at the top in a partially glazed dome which has been precisely angled to maximise daylight with minimal solar glare. A reflecting panel on the roof also helps to direct sunlight to the floors below. The dome and other windows respond automatically according to the temperature in the building; ventilating it naturally.

Origins and early movement The Mexican anarchist movement originated in the mid-19th century, a product of both Mexico's unique historical development and European influences.Hart 1978, p. 3. Utopian ideas and movements went back further. Vasco de Quiroga attempted in the 1530s to create Thomas More's Utopia in two communities, while the priest and senator Jos√© Mar√≠a Alpudre tried to start another socialist community of Freemasons in 1825. In 1828, the English socialist Robert Owen requested permission from the Mexican government to start a utopian colony in Texas. Melchor Ocampo, a Mexican radical, while in exile in New Orleans read Charles Fourier and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and translated a chapter of the latter's Philosophy of Poverty.Cappelletti 2017, pp. 291-292. The Greek-born philosopher Plotino Rhodakanaty, like the famed anarchist Mikhail Bakunin of aristocratic descent, arrived in Mexico in February 1861 and was the first advocate for anarchist ideas in the country. He had participated in the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and then in Berlin come into contact with Hegel, Fourier, and Proudhon's ideas. Upon arriving in Mexico, he concluded that traditional Mexican peasant villages were already implementing Fourier and Proudhon's ideals. These communities, however, were under threat from hacendados and the government and Rhodakanaty sought to organize them and build a network of socialist agrarian colonies.Cappelletti 2017, pp. 280-284, Hart 1978, pp. 19-20. He wrote the pamphlet Cartilla Socialista, the first socialist publication in Mexico, to gain supporters in this struggle. It argued that humankind was essentially good, but was corrupted by private property, social inequality, and exploitation. He failed to gain adherents for his agrarian colonies.Hart 1978, p. 20, Valad√©s 1970, p. 9. He took on a teaching post and started the Group of Socialist Students (Grupo de Estudiantes Socialistas), which followed Bakunin's teachings. It included Francisco Zalasota and Santiago Villanueva who would be leaders in agrarian and urban labor struggles, respectively.Hart 1978, pp. 20-21. After the 1871 Paris Commune, Rhodakanaty's group turned its focus to urban workers and founding a proletarian anarchist movement. While Rhodakanaty's moral outreach did not reach beyond young artisans and peasants, he inspired Julio L√≥pez Ch√°vez to lead a peasant rebellion in the late 1860s. In the mid-19th century, workers' organizations confronted inadequate working conditions. Mutualist groups offered members compensation for unemployment, medical leave, and old age, and focused on providing equal social provisions to workers rather than critiquing capitalism. Separately, anarchist groups, who blamed capitalism and the state for workers' ills, encouraged worker protest, as influenced by the European anarchist movement. Anarchists organized the country's first industrial strikes. Mutualist groups were hesitant to strike, but eventually joined. The strikes, mostly for wages and working conditions, were primarily in textile and mining industries.  Mexican Revolution  Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n was the preeminent figure in early 20th-century Mexican anarchism and a progenitor of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. He wrote the newspaper Regeneraci√≥n with his brother Enrique. Their movement of followers were known as the Magonistas. Anselmo L. Figueroa was a Mexican-American anarchist political figure, journalist and member of the Organizing Council of the Mexican Liberal Party (MLP). He was imprisoned in the United States between 1911 and 1914 due to violations of U.S. neutrality laws. He published Regeneraci√≥n, the official newspaper of the MLP, before and after his imprisonment. At the time of the uprisings, Regeneraci√≥n generated about US$1,000 per week in subscription fees. Even after covering its publication costs, several hundred dollars per week were made available for MLP revolutionary causes. Smaller sums of money were received from outside donors to the organization. Regeneraci√≥n was published until 1918. It was distributed in Mexican communities in the United States and used in literacy lessons there, as books were often scarce. Juana Bel√©n Guti√©rrez de Mendoza was an anarchist and feminist activist, typographer, journalist and poet born in San Juan del R√≠o, Durango, Mexico. While many women contributed in the Mexican Revolution 1910-1920 by fighting alongside their husbands, others wrote against the injustices of the D√≠az regime. In May 1901 she found an anti-D√≠az newspaper called V√©sper. She attacked the clergy in Guanajuato and wrote against foreign domination in Mexico. She also wrote against the D√≠az regime and criticized D√≠az for not carrying out the requests and needs of the people. As a result, her newspaper was confiscated and she was also put in jail several times by D√≠az between 1904 and 1920. She established a new newspaper called El Desmonte (1900-1919) and continued her writings. She translated the works of Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, and Pierre Joseph Proudhon to Spanish. She was also a Caxcan Indian from the state of Durango.Pouwels, Joel Bollinger. Political Journalism by Mexican Women During the Age of Revolution 1876-1940.

Origins  Born in Karrasch, West Prussia (now Poland), Winkler came from a family of teachers. As a teenager, he was working for the postal service by 1891. By 1914 he was a city councillor in Graudenz, West Prussia (now GrudziƒÖdz, Poland), and by November 1918 was the last mayor of German Graudenz. This portion of West Prussia was part of the Polish Corridor, ceded to the Second Republic of Poland, following World War I, to provide it access to the Baltic Sea. From 1919 Winkler was a member of the Landtag in Prussia for the German Democratic Party, and between 1920 and 1933 served as Reich Trustee for Ceded German Areas.  German Film  As head of Cautio Treuhand GmbH, a German holding company, Winkler was trusted with the task of economically and culturally supporting ethnic German communities in other countries, and establishing the \\"fortification\\" of German minority newspapers. After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Nazi Germany in 1933, Winkler was instrumental in the Gleichschaltung (bringing in line) of the press. Winkler did not join the ruling Nazi Party until 1937. In the same year, the F√ºhrer named him \\"Reich Commissioner for the German Film Industry\\". In this function, by order of Joseph Goebbels's Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, he decreed appointments and instructions which curtailed the industry's entrepreneurial freedom. This included the nationalization of controlling interests in all German film production companies, most importantly Universum Film AG and Tobis Film.Literature and Film in the Third Reich, edited by Karl-Heinz Schoeps, page 207 Winkler's Cautio holding company also financed the creation of Continental Films within occupied France, producer of 30 feature films between 1941 and 1944, for example The Murderer Lives at Number 21.Grand Illusion: The Third Reich, the Paris Exposition, and the Cultural ...by Karen Fiss, page 208 Between 1939 and 1945, Winkler was leader of the Main Trusteeship Office East (Haupttreuhandstelle Ost), responsible for the administration of seized industrial and property assets in Poland during World War II.  After World War II  After the war, Winkler was held in an internment camp while the Denazification court in L√ºneburg considered his fate. By 11 August 1949, the court had classified Winkler as \\"uncharged\\" and released him. He then became a staffer at a film company. Under orders from the new West German government, Winkler was involved in the attempted Denazification of the Universum Film AG company--whose product was so associated with the Third Reich that reissues of its non-political catalogue were proving difficult to market.

It is a member of the Castle family of solitaire games,\\"Fortress\\" (p.199) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. but has two more tableau piles than Beleaguered Castle and the piles are shorter. Overview First, ten overlapping rows of cards are formed, two containing six cards (one on the left and one at the right) and the rest having five cards (four at each side). A space is left in the middle for the aces, which when available, become the bases for the foundations. The foundations are each built up by suit up to kings. At the tableau rows, the top card (i.e. the fully exposed one) of each row is available for play on the foundations or in the tableau. Tableau building is up or down by suit as the player pleases. However, one card can be moved at a time, and building is not round-the-corner, i.e. aces cannot be placed over kings and vice versa. Spaces can be filled with any available card. The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations. But like Beleaguered Castle and its cousin Streets and Alleys, winning is slim because of the distribution of high cards in the tableau. Rules Game-play is described in the book Lady Cadogan's Illustrated Games of Solitaire of Patience as follows:Cadogan, Adelaide, 1914. Lady Cadogan's Illustrated Games of Solitaire or Patience (New Revised Edition, including American Games). David McKay Company, Philadelphia Deal out the entire pack horizontally in two groups, as in tableau, beginning at the left hand, and dealing straight across each group, leaving space in the centre for four aces. These, when they can be played, form the foundation cards, and are to descend in sequence to kings. Two key rules apply throughout: I. Only the outside cards of each group are available, until by their removal the next ones are released, the principle being that no card can be used that has another outside it. Note: By \\"outside\\" is meant the cards on the right side of the right-hand group, and those on the left side of the left-hand group. II. The foundations must follow suit. Should any aces appear on the outside of either group, play them, as also any other suitable cards for continuing the foundations (Rules I and II). You next proceed to form marriages, both in ascending and in descending lines, with cards on the outside of both groups (Rule I). But this must be done with extreme care, so as not only to release the greatest number of suitable cards, but also, if possible, to open out one entire horizontal row of cards to form a lane. The success of the game entirely depends on these lanes. If, therefore, you succeed in opening out one, it is more prudent not to refill it until, by some fresh combination, others can be made. When a lane is to be refilled, select any available card (Rule I), and place it at the inner end of the lane, and along it any others in sequence of the same suit, the last card being, of course, the available one. One great use of these lanes is to reverse any sequences that have been made by marriages in the ascending line. Note: Supposing you have placed upon a deuce a sequence ending with eight; place the eight at the inner end of the lane, the other cards following in succession until the deuce becomes the outside card. When there are more cards in the lane than the original number, they can be placed partly over each other. There is no re-deal. Variants Chessboard is a variation of Fortress. It is played like Fortress except that in this game, the player can freely choose the starting rank of all the foundations.\\"Chessboard\\" (p.200) in Hoyle's Rules of Games (3rd edition) by Philip D. Morehead (ed.), 2001. Furthermore, building can go round-the-corner, i.e. aces can be placed over kings and vice versa.

The presence of twenty-five Italian glosses in his works indicates that he lived in Italy. The Sekel ·π¨ob, written in 1139 at Rome, is a midrashic compilation on the Pentateuch. The substance of the old midrashim is quoted in smooth and ornate language, from which foreign words are excluded, the general method being that of Tobiah ben Eliezer's Le·∏≥a·∏• ·π¨ob, which is frequently quoted, both with and without acknowledgment. Menahem's sources, in addition to the Targumim, are the whole of the earlier midrashic literature as well as the literature of geonic mysticism. He interprets also halakic authors, especially Alfasi and R. Hananeel, explaining verses as well as single words literally, although he expressly states that the midrashic interpretation is deeper and more thorough. Sekel ·π¨ob is frequently quoted both for its exegesis and for its halakic decisions. In the Middle Ages it was still intact, but now only the portion from Gen. xv. 1 to Ex. xi. 2 (edited by Buber, Berlin, 1900) is in existence, in two separate manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Of Menahem's other work, the Eben Bo·∏•an, only fragments are extant (Munich MS. No. 55). A part of it has been translated by Dukes, and it has been analyzed in detail by Bacher. This work, completed at Rome in 1143, in five months, was intended to prepare the author's three young sons for the study of the Bible. Menahem undertook to prepare for the first time in Hebrew a comprehensive manual of the Hebrew language and of Biblical exegesis. The work was divided into fifty parts; the first part, by far the largest and most valuable, was a dictionary of the Hebrew language; the other parts, now known only by their chapter-headings, dealt with grammar. The author follows chiefly Menahem ben Saruq; occasionally, and with diffidence, however, he advances his own views, and the entire conception of the form and contents of the work shows a certain degree of independence. It was intended, according to Bacher, to uphold Menahem b. Saru·∏≥'s system against the teachings of ·∏§ayyuj and Ibn Jana·∏•, introduced about that time (1143) into Italy by Abraham ibn Ezra.

One scribe, an army scribe, Hori, writes to his fellow scribe, Amenemope, in such a way as to ridicule the irresponsible and second-rate nature of Amenemope's work. The papyrus was originally purchased from Giovanni Anastasi in 1839. Content and importance to modern scholarship The letter gives examples of what a scribe was supposed to be able to do: calculating the number of rations which have to be doled out to a certain number of soldiers digging a lake or the quantity of bricks needed to erect a ramp of given dimensions,Dieter Arnold The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B.Tauris 2002, p.40 assessing the number of men needed to move an obelisk or erect a statue, and organizing the supply of provisions for an army. In a long section Hori discusses the geography of the Mediterranean coast as far north as the Lebanon and the troubles which might beset a traveller there. This papyrus is important to historians and Bible scholars above all for the information it supplies about towns in Syria and Canaan during the New Kingdom.Kitchen 2000, p.530. There is a long list of towns which run along the northern border of the djadi or watershed of the Jordan in Canaan, which bound Lebanon along the Litani River and upper retnu and Syria along the Orontes. The border lands of Egypt's province of Caanan with Kadesh are defined in the Gardiner translation p. 19. > Come let me tell thee of other towns, which are above(??) them. Thou hast > not gone to the land of Kadesh, Tekhes, Kurmeren, Temenet, Deper, Idi, > Herenem. Thou hast not beheld Kirjath-anab and Beth-Sepher. Thou dost not > know Ideren, nor yet Djedpet. Thou dost not know the name of Kheneredj which > is in the land of Upe, a bull upon its boundary, the scene of the battles of > every warrior. Pray teach me concerning the appearance(?) of Kin; acquaint > me with Rehob; explain Beth-sha-el and Tereqel. The stream of Jordan, how is > it crossed? Cause me to know the way of crossing over to Megiddo which is > above it(??). An example of the satire in the text Hori goes on to show that Amenemope is not skilled in the role of a maher. The word maher is discussed in Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar under \\"Messenger\\" and can be found on the inscription of the battle of Kadesh above the head of one such Mariannu scout. > Thou art a Maher skilled in the deeds of the brave! A Maher such as thou art > is found (able) to march at the head of an army! O Mariannu, forward to > shoot(?)! Hori then relates what appears to be an actual anecdote for which Amenemope is apparently infamous. It contains a lot of detail reflecting discreditably on his name and comparing him to Qedjerdi, the chief of Isser. This touches on the concept of gossip amongst the scribes for which the idiom is \\"Much in the mouths of.\\" The composition of the satirical interchange between the scribes comes across as quite well written especially where Hori describes Amenemope as incompetent toward the end, giving as an example his poor management of not just his chariot but his character. Amenemope gets ambushed in a mountain pass, possibly at a battle in the campaigns against Kadesh, which go on throughout the 18th and 19th dynasties. Hori makes clear that these involve routes that should be well known to the scribes operating as mahers or messengers and scouts in the battles. Illustrations from the Battle of Kadesh provide an excellent background for Hori's tale showing the form of the chariots, and the size of the Shashu. > Behold the ///////// is in a ravine two thousand cubits deep, filled with > boulders and pebbles. Thou drawest back(?), thou graspest the bow, thou dost > //////. Thy left hand, thou causest the great ones to look. Their eyes are > good, thy hand grows weak(?). Abdt km Ari mhr nam. Thou makest the name of > every Maher, officers of the land of Egypt. Thy name becomes like (that of) > Qedjerdi, the chief of Isser, when the hyena found him in the balsam-tree. Hori sets this up as an incident in which the incompetence, inexperience and fear of Amenemope results in the wreck of his chariot and the panicked cutting of his hand with a knife while trying to cut loose his horse from the wreck of his chariot. Amenemope's lack of experience causes him not to be apprehensive when he should be and then panicking when he should remain calm. > \\\\- The(?) narrow defile is infested(?) with Shosu concealed beneath the > bushes; some of them are of four cubits or of five cubits, from head(??) to > foot(?), fierce of face, their heart is not mild, and they hearken not to > coaxing.

Origin The Oxford English Dictionary gives Homer as the source for the English poetic tradition of describing the meadows of the afterlife as being covered in asphodel. Homer's \\"asphodel meadow\\" (·ºÄœÉœÜŒøŒ¥ŒµŒª·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒπŒº·ø∂ŒΩŒ±), \\"where the spirits of the dead dwell\\" (Od. 24.14), has throughout Western literary history been envisioned as a pleasant and even desirable place. This was the impression among many of the ancient Greek poets and Homeric commentators, who understood the adjective ·ºÄœÉœÜŒøŒ¥ŒµŒªœåœÇ to mean \\"flowery,\\" \\"fragrant,\\" \\"fertile,\\" and ‚Äúlush,‚Äù and who even referred to the asphodel meadow as a ‚Äúparadise‚Äù (œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπœÉŒøœÇ). This was all the more so among the post-Renaissance English poets, especially those of the Romantic tradition, who painted colorful pictures of ‚Äúhappy souls who dwell in yellow meads of asphodel.‚Äù But this is not the picture drawn in books 11 and 24 of the Odyssey, our earliest extended descriptions of Hades, and our earliest references to an ‚Äúasphodel meadow.‚Äù The three Odyssean passages in which Hades features an ‚Äúasphodel meadow‚Äù (11.539, 573; 24.13) portray a dark, gloomy, and mirthless place. This is not the Elysian Plain, where life is easy, and there ever blows a refreshing West wind (Od. 4.561-69); nor is it the Isles of the Blessed, where the grain-giving soil bears its sweet fruit for the most distinguished, and carefree, heroes (Hesiod‚Äôs Op. 167-73); this is Hades ‚Äì dark, dank, and sunless (Od. 10.512; 24.10; cf. Il. 20.65; H.Dem. 337) ‚Äì where disembodied and senseless spirits of the dead weep and wail pathetically (Od. 11.391, 475-6, 605-6; 24.5-9) and flit about purposelessly like shadows or dreams (Od. 10.495; 11.207-8, 222). The disjunction has caused Classical scholar and linguist Steve Reece to propose a period in the development of the epic diction when the shape of the formula used to describe Hades was Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÉœÄŒøŒ¥ŒµŒª·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒπŒº·ø∂ŒΩŒ± ‚Äúthroughout the ash-filled meadow.\\" This formula, Reece proposes, was misheard, misunderstood, and misanalyzed by a pre-Homeric bard as Œ∫Œ±œÑ‚Äô ·ºÄœÉœÜŒøŒ¥ŒµŒª·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒªŒµŒπŒº·ø∂ŒΩŒ± ‚Äúthroughout the asphodel (i.e. flowery) meadow.‚ÄùReece, Steve, \\"Homer's Asphodel Meadow,\\" Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 389-400. Later depictions The Asphodel Meadows is most probably where the souls of people who lived mediocre lives remain, but its relationship to other places in the Greek afterlife remains uncertain. For later Greek poets the very ancient pre-Homeric association of the Asphodel flower with a positive form of afterlife as well as the enlarged role of Elysium as it became the destination of more than just a few lucky heroes, altered the character of the meadows. Greek poets who wrote after Homer's time describe them as untouched, lovely, soft and holy. Such an evolutionary change is quite common: \\"Like most cultures throughout human history, both ancient and modern, the Greeks held complex and sometimes contradictory views about the afterlife\\".Reece, Steve, \\"Homer's Asphodel Meadow,\\" Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies 47 (2007) 389-400. Some depictions describe it as a land of utter neutrality. That is, while the inhabitants were in life neither good nor evil, so they are treated in the afterlife. Other depictions have also stated that all residents drink from the river Lethe before entering the fields, thus losing their identities. This somewhat negative outlook on the afterlife for those who make little impact was perhaps passed down to encourage militarism in Greek cultures as opposed to inaction. In fact, those who did take up arms and became heroes were rewarded with everlasting joy in the fields of Elysium. Edith Hamilton suggests that the Asphodel of these fields are not exactly like the Asphodel of our world but are \\"presumably strange, pallid, ghostly flowers.\\"Edith Hamilton. Mythology. New York: Warner Books, 1999. Ch. 1, p. 40. Others suggest that they were actually narcissi.

Hughes founded the media company Radio One (now known as Urban One), and when the company went public in 1999, she became the first African- American woman to head a publicly traded corporation. In the 1970s, Hughes created the urban radio format called \\"The Quiet Storm\\" on Howard University's radio station WHUR with disc jockey and fellow Howard student Melvin Lindsey. Early life Cathy Hughes was born to Helen Jones Woods, a trombonist with the International Sweethearts of Rhythm at Piney Woods School, a private boarding school in Mississippi, and William Alfred Woods, who was the first African-American to earn an accounting degree from Creighton University. The family lived in the Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects while Hughes' father attended college.\\"Owning the airwaves - Cathy Hughes buys radio stations for African-American programming.\\" Essence. Jones, C. October 1998. Hughes was far from an only child, growing up with a household of siblings. She found her love for music at a very young age, while repeatedly each night lying in bed listening to Everly Brothers and the Platters. In the early life of Cathy Hughes, things were not easy for her because her parents did not have much money. At this young vital age she struggled to feed. In fact, she lied about her age to get her first job at the age of 14 years of age. Hughes went to the University of Nebraska Omaha and Creighton University taking Business Administration courses, her father's alma mater, but was not able to complete and receive a degree, which led to her getting a job as a sales manager at Howard University's radio station, WHUR-FM. Career Before radio, in the mid-1960s, Hughes worked for an African American newspaper called the Omaha Star.Forss, Amy Helene (2014) Black Print with a White Carnation: Mildred Brown and the Omaha Star Newspaper, 1938-1989. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. Hughes began her career in 1969 at KOWH in Omaha, but left for Washington, D.C. after she was offered a job as an administrative assistant with Tony Brown at the School of Communications at Howard University. In 1973, she became General Sales Manager of the university's radio station, WHUR-FM, increasing station revenue from $250,000 to $3 million in her first year. In 1975, Hughes became the first woman vice president and general manager of a station in the nation's capital and created the format known as the \\"Quiet Storm,\\" which revolutionized urban radio and was aired on over 480 stations nationwide. During her marriage with Dewey Hughes in 1979, they set out to purchase a radio station. Successfully finding a lender after being denied thirty-two times by banks, in 1980 Hughes and then-husband Dewey founded Radio One, subsequently buying AM radio station WOL 1450 in Washington, D.C.The Reeler (July 9, 2007): \\"Talking the Talk - Is the biopic over? Talk to Me's Don Cheadle on life, liberties and pursuing a hero\\", by S.T. VanAirsdale After the previous employees had destroyed the facility, she faced financial difficulties and subsequently lost her home and moved with her young son to live at the station. Her fortunes began to change when she revamped the R&B; station to a 24-hour talk radio format with the theme, \\"Information is Power.\\" Hughes served as the station's Morning Show Host for 11 years. In 1982 the bank had threatened to cease payments to Hughes investment unless she agreed to airing music. She decided to keep her station as a talking format in the AM and music throughout the day. WOL is still the most-listened-to talk radio station in the nation's capital. In 1987, Hughes bought radio station WMMJ with her company Radio One (now Urban One). In 1995, Radio One bought radio station WKYS. Radio One went on to own 70 radio stations in nine major markets in the U.S. In 1999, Radio One became a publicly traded company, listed under the NASDAQ stock exchange. As of 2007, Hughes's son, Alfred Liggins, III, serves as CEO and president of Radio One, and Hughes as chairperson. Hughes is also a minority owner of BET industries. In January 2004, Radio One launched TV One, a national cable and satellite television network which bills itself as the \\"lifestyle and entertainment network for African-American adults.\\" Hughes interviews prominent personalities, usually in the entertainment industry, for the network's talk program TV One on One. Both Cathy Hughes and her son, Alfred Liggins have been named Entrepreneur of the Year by the company Ernst & Young. She is a notable member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. In 2015, a local business organization unofficially named the corner of 4th Street and H Street NE in Washington, D.C. \\"Cathy Hughes Corner\\". Hughes' life story is featured on the documentary series Profiles of African-American Success. In 2016, Hughes was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. In 2020, she accepted a position on the Board of Trustees at Creighton University in Omaha. Personal life Hughes was married to Alfred Liggins Jr from 1965 to 1967. Together they had one child, Alfred Liggins III, born January 30, 1965, in Omaha, Nebraska. She got pregnant when she was sixteen and her mom threw her out of her house. Hughes married Dewey Hughes in 1979 and they divorced in 1987. They had no children together. Hughes, Cathy, said that the debt was overwhelming for him. He was never an entrepreneur. She, on the other hand, was focused and knew she could pay back the 1 million dollars they were able to borrow from their \\"angel\\" lender. After her divorce and with looming debt, she ended up moving into the station with her son. When asked if it was hard or stressful to deal with she said \\"No, number one I was in awe of Washington DC. I was in Georgetown. I haven't been able to get back there yet! During my struggling days, I had a prime corner. You would see the president having dinner at one of the restaurants.\\" Even with her determination, her son always came first. He had his first little tuxedo before he was out of grade school because he was her date, she took him everywhere. They would always have dinner together and do his homework. Awards Cathy Hughes has titled many awards. Granted an honorary doctorate from Sojourner Douglass College in Baltimore in 1995. That accomplishment drove Hughes back to school 2 years later. In 1988, she was the first woman awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the twelfth annual ceremony. Hughes is also a member of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs Business Hall of Fame. Jumping to the year 2000, she was awarded the First Annual Black History Hall of Fame Award. Following that she was presented the National Action Network‚Äôs \\"Keepers of the Dream\\" award, which is an award that spotlights role models who contribute to and honor Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs legacy. Radio One is number nine on BET 100, with a net worth of $450.8 million for 2015. See also *Laurence C.

Ittenbach began his art education as a student of Kaufmann, then left to study under Franz Katz in Cologne. In 1832, Ittenbach became a pupil, at the age of 19, of the D√ºsseldorf Academy, where he also received private lessons from its president, Schadow. He is associated with the D√ºsseldorf school of painting. He was a member of the Nazarene movement and associated himself mainly with three of his friends and fellow-students: Karl and Andreas M√ºller, and Ernst Deger. The four men travelled about in Germany, studying and painting together. From 1839 to 1842, Ittenbach lived in Italy. On his return, he stayed in Munich for some time. In 1849, he returned to D√ºsseldorf. He died there in 1879. From 1859 until his death, he was a member of the artist club \\"Malkasten\\". Ittenbach was exceedingly religious and persistently declined any commissions for mythological or pagan subjects. As a rule, he devoted his energies exclusively to church decoration. He would precede the execution of his greatest works with devout religious exercises, including confession and communion. Madonna and Child (1855) His finest paintings are said to be found at Bonn, in the St. Remigius, and in Breslau in a church dedicated to the same saint. There is also a remarkable \\"Holy Family\\" dated 1861, painted for Prince Liechtenstein in his private chapel near Vienna. Most of his other works can be found in various Catholic churches in GermanyOne, however, depicting Mary Queen of Heaven (of unknown date), was sold by a Cheltenham (England) Anglican Church in 2013 . His only important fresco was painted in 1844 in a church at Remagen. Ittenbach was a popular painter in court circles, a member of most of the European academies, and the recipient of many medals and decorations. He painted a few portraits, but they were unimportant; his main work was his altar-pieces.

Growth factors that inhibit neovascularization include those that affect endothelial cell division and differentiation. These growth factors often act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion; they include fibroblast growth factor, placental growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and platelet-derived endothelial growth factor. There are three different pathways that comprise neovascularization:(1) vasculogenesis,(2) angiogenesis, and (3) arteriogenesis. Three Pathways of Neovascularization=Vasculogenesis Vasculogenesis is the de novo formation of blood vessels. This primarily occurs in the developing embryo with the development of the first primitive vascular plexus, but also occurs to a limited extent with post-natal vascularization. Embryonic vasculogenesis occurs when endothelial cells precursors (hemangioblasts) begin to proliferate and migrate into avascular areas. There, they aggregate to form the primitive network of vessels characteristic of embryos. This primitive vascular system is necessary to provide adequate blood flow to cells, supplying oxygen and nutrients, and removing metabolic wastes. Angiogenesis Angiogenesis is the most common type of neovascularization seen in development and growth, and is import to both physiological and pathological processes. Angiogenesis occurs through the formation of new vessels from pre-existing vessels. This occurs through the sprouting of new capillaries from post-capillary venules, requiring precise coordination of multiple steps and the participation and communication of multiple cell types. The complex process is initiated in response to local tissue ischemia or hypoxia, leading to the release of angiogenic factors such as VEGF and HIF-1. This leads to vasodilatation and an increase in vascular permeability, leading to sprouting angiogenesis or intussusceptive angiogenesis. Arteriogenesis Arteriogenesis is the process of flow- related remodelling of existing vasculature to create collateral arteries. This can occur in response to ischemic vascular diseases or increase demand (e.g. exercise training). Arteriogenesis is triggered through nonspecific factors, such as shear stress and blood flow. Ocular Pathologies=Corneal Neovascularization Corneal neovascularization is a condition where new blood vessels invade into the cornea from the limbus. It is triggered when the balance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors are disrupted that otherwise maintain corneal transparency. The immature new blood vessels can lead to persistent inflammation and scaring, lipid exudation into the corneal tissues, and a reduction in corneal transparency, which can affect visual acuity. Retinopathy of Prematurity Retinopathy of prematurity is a condition that occurs in premature babies. In premature babies, the retina has not completely vascularized. Rather than continuing in the normal in utero fashion, the vascularization of the retina is disrupted, leading to an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels between the areas of vascularized and avascular retina. These blood vessels grow in abnormal ways and can invade into the vitreous humor, where they can hemorrhage or cause retinal detachment in neonates. Diabetic Retinopathy Diabetic retinopathy, which can develop into proliferative diabetic retinopathy, is a condition where capillaries in the retina become occluded, which creates areas of ischemic retina and triggering the release of angiogenic growth factors. This retinal ischemia stimulates the proliferation of new blood vessels from pre-existing retinal venules. It is the leading cause of blindness of working age adults. Age-related macular degeneration In persons who are over 65 years old, age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of severe vision loss. A subtype of age-related macular degeneration, wet macular degeneration, is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels that originate in the choroidal vasculature and extend into the subretinal space. Choroidal Neovascularization In ophthalmology, choroidal neovascularization is the formation of a microvasculature within the innermost layer of the choroid of the eye. Neovascularization in the eye can cause a type of glaucoma (neovascularization glaucoma) if the new blood vessels' bulk blocks the constant outflow of aqueous humour from inside the eye. Neovascularization and Therapy=Ischemic heart disease Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Ischemic heart disease develops when stenosis and occlusion of coronary arteries develops, leading to reduced perfusion of the cardiac tissues. There is ongoing research exploring techniques that might be able to induce healthy neovascularization of ischemic cardiac tissues.

He was murdered on December 14, 1993; the identities of his killers remained unknown to Singapore police for more than two years. In 1998, Too Yin Sheong (alias \\"Nelson\\"), one of the men accused of the murder, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Another two accomplices were caught in 1998 and 2005 respectively, and ended up in one jailed for robbery while the other condemned to hang for the crime. Murder and outcome According to the statement of Too at his trial, he had met Professor Lee at a coffeeshop; soon after that, the professor gave Too his telephone number and invited Too to visit his home. When Too did visit, the professor made overtures to have sexual intercourse with him, which he declined. Before leaving, Too noticed that the Professor had valuable antiques in his home. When Too mentioned this incident to two friends--Ng Chek Siong (alias \\"Koo Neng\\") and Lee Chez Kee (alias \\"Kim Beh\\"), Lee suggested robbing the professor. He also suggested that Too arrange a meeting on the pretext of introducing Lee to the professor, so that the group could gain entry to Professor Lee's house. On December 12, 1993, the three went to Professor Lee's house in a car with Ng as the driver. Too and Lee entered the house, where they tied the Professor up, then stabbed and strangled him to death. They ransacked his house and stole his ATM card, which Too later used to withdraw money from the Professor's bank account. The Professor had lived alone, and his body was found only two days later in a partly decomposed state. For a long time, his killers remained at large. Only an anonymous tip-off, two years after the murder, enabled police to make progress in solving the case. Too Yin Sheng and Ng Chek Siong were arrested in 1998. Too was charged for murdering the Professor, and sentenced to death on 28 August 1998; he lost his appeal and was hanged in April 1999. Ng got off more lightly-- he was convicted of robbing the Professor's home, and sentenced to eight years in jail, in addition to ten strokes of the cane for theft and cheating. Ng was released by October 2003 and he had returned to Malaysia since then. Lee Chez Kee fled Singapore to Malaysia shortly after the murder. In June 2005, he was arrested by the Royal Malaysian Police for theft, and jailed. On 18 February 2006, Singapore police announced that they had extradited him back to face trial for the murder, having made arrangements with Malaysian police to extradite him upon his release from prison. He was charged in court on 19 February 2006, and sentenced to death on 10 October 2006. His appeal was dismissed on 12 May 2008 by a 2-1 majority, in a landmark judgment that clarified the doubt of admission of hearsay evidence by a dead accomplice under the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act, as well as the finding of a common intention under the Penal Code.

Overview Virgins and Philistines failed to gain a large audience due to difficulty in marketing an album with such a diverse sound‚Äîit mixes 1960s and early 1970s pop music with more acoustic based melodies and string arrangements. The album is often regarded as the direct musical predecessor to the later work of The Lightning Seeds in the 1990s, with whom singer Terry Hall would later collaborate in a songwriting role whilst providing occasional vocals. Virgins and Philistines contained all original material except \\"The Hammond Song\\" (a cover of The Roches song), and \\"Can‚Äôt Get Enough of You Baby\\" (written by Linzer/Randell), which was the only track that received much airplay. The album was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport (near Manchester) and was produced by Hugh Jones and Jeremy Green, and engineered by Chris Jones. Additional personnel featured on the album included Pete de Freitas (Echo & the Bunnymen) on drums, Paul Burgess (ex- Camel, also drums), Preston Heyman (percussion), Ian Nelson (clarinet), and Katrina Phillips (background vocals). Release Virgins and Philistines was released in April 1985 over a year after the group's first release. It charted at #12 on the UK Albums Chart and #28 on the New Zealand Album chart. It was preceded by three singles. The first, \\"Take\\", did not chart as highly as their d√©but and only made #70 in the UK. The second single, \\"Thinking of You\\", was much better received and returned Hall to the top forty in the UK and Ireland, reaching #12 and #11 respectively. \\"Castles in the Air\\" was the final single and directly preceded the album, but it only managed #51. The album was released in the US with different track listing including the band's self- titled d√©but single. It also added the B-sides \\"I Can't Get Enough of You Baby\\", \\"Pushing Up the Daisies\\" and \\"Your Love Was Smashing\\". \\"Armchair Theatre\\" and \\"Yours Sincerely\\" were not included, but were later released in the US on the EP; The Colour Field. The album was released in Canada with the same track order as the US release. Faint Hearts is a shorter 3:58 minute version that excludes the 20 second slow vocal introduction. Another notable difference is the song titles: \\"I Can't Get Enough of You Baby\\" appears as \\"Can't Get Enough Of You Baby\\" and \\"The Colour Field\\" is listed as \\"The Colourfield\\". In 1999, the album was re-released in Japan with twenty tracks, including all of the songs on the UK and US versions of the album plus all of the singles, B-Sides and remixes that were released before and immediately after the original release of Virgins And Philistines. In 2010, the album was reissued once again, this new version was released by Cherry Red and it included most of the bonus tracks of the 1999 version.

It is located on the eastern side of the Far Northeast, northwest of Byberry Creek and east of Northeast Philadelphia Airport. Characteristics Morrell Park is primarily a residential district, with only a handful of small industries, all of which are located within one and a half miles of the Northeast Philadelphia Airport. The residences themselves consist mostly of rowhouses, but Morrell Park is distinctive in that most of its row homes have garages in front, facing and with access to the street, something quite different from the traditional Philadelphia rowhouse design. (An exception is one side of one block of Wessex Lane and Churchill Lane, where houses have garages in the back with access to a shared driveway. The duplexes along Frankford Ave. are also set up in this manner.) Later rowhouses followed this form of having garages in the front, but this was first seen in Morrell Park in the very late 1950s. Most homes have kitchens that face the front, living rooms that face the rear of the property, three or four bedrooms, and about of living space. The street pattern of the development is also quite distinctive, as a view of an aerial photo will confirm, consisting of a few through streets that curve through many looping side streets with only one cul-de-sac, Pitt Pl. The streets curve to conform to the natural topography of the area, for years avoiding development right along the stream valley of Byberry Creek, which flows through and about the development before its confluence with Poquessing Creek. History The land area of Morrell Park was originally the summer home estate of Edward and Louise Morrell. Colonel Edward deVeaux Morrell (1863-1917), a lawyer, was a US congressman from 1900 to 1907. Born in Newport, Rhode Island, he was graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1885. He was a colonel and afterward a brigadier general in the National Guard. He was a member of the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry and owned extensive land in Torresdale. His wife Louise was the daughter of Francis Anthony Drexel and Francis's second wife Emma Bouvier, related [first cousin twice removed] to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy. Louise's uncle was Anthony J. Drexel, founder of Drexel University, and her two older half-sisters were Elizabeth Drexel and Saint Katharine Drexel. The Morrells built their summer home , one of the five homes they maintained, near what is now Morrell and Frankford Avenues, not too far from Francis Drexel's summer home , which was itself near what is now the emergency room of Aria Health's Torresdale Campus. The Morrells entertained extensively, maintained a horse track, established the first telephone line north of Frankford, built the electric-light plant in the area, and conducted an amusement park called Torresdale Park, located by Poquessing Creek behind the trolley barn at Frankford Avenue and Knights Road. The park ran from 1880 to 1906. After Torresdale Park closed, it donated many of its rides to Willow Grove Park, once located at the site of the present-day Willow Grove Park Mall. The Morrells had no children. Edward Morrell served on Philadelphia's board of education from 1912 to 1916, and died in Colorado Springs, CO (where he had gone for health reasons) in September 1917; he is interred in a family crypt at Eden Hall in Torresdale. Louise died twenty-six years after her husband, in 1943, and the area was planned for development by the Korman Corporation in the late 1950s. Morrell Park was settled in earnest during the 1960s by families moving from other areas of Philadelphia. Children attended the Aloysius Fitzpatrick Elementary School at Knights Rd & Chalfont Dr until the John Hancock Elementary School opened at West Crown & Morrell Ave in the autumn of 1968. Children also attended Christ the King School on Chesterfield Road, which opened in 1965. The population of its postal ZIP code, 19114, which covers more territory than Morrell Park alone once did, was approximated at 31,000 inhabitants in 1990.

The Deed of Paksenarrion revolves around the adult life of Paksenarrion Dorthansdotter, known as Paks, of Three Firs. It takes place in a fictional medieval world of kingdoms of humans, dwarves, gnomes and elves. The story begins by introducing Paks as a headstrong girl of 18, who leaves her home in Three Firs (fleeing a marriage arranged by her father) to join a mercenary company and through her journeys and hardships comes to realize that she has been gifted as a paladin, if in a rather non-traditional way. Paksenarrion works, fights, and sacrifices herself until she can see the rightful king of Lyonya established over the opposition of evil forces, or gods, and evil humans.

The ecoregion covers an area of , extending across portions of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, and Telangana states. Setting The Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests extend from the Bay of Bengal coast in northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, across the northern portion of the Eastern Ghats range and the northeastern Deccan Plateau, to the eastern Satpura Range and the upper Narmada River valley. The forests of the ecoregion are sustained by the moisture-bearing monsoon winds from the Bay of Bengal, which lies to the southeast. The ecoregion is bounded on the north and west by tropical dry deciduous forest ecoregions, including the Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests to the southwest and west, the Narmada valley dry deciduous forests to the northwest, and the Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests to the north and northeast. The drier Northern dry deciduous forests ecoregion, lying west of the Eastern Ghats range, is completely surrounded by the Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests, in the rain shadow of the Ghats, which partially block the moisture-laden monsoon winds off the Bay of Bengal. The humid Orissa semi-evergreen forests ecoregion lies to the northeast in the coastal lowlands of Orissa. Flora The ecoregion's forests are dominated by Sal (Shorea robusta), in association with Terminalia, Adina, Toona, Syzygium, Buchanania, Cleisanthus, and Anogeissus, according to soil variations. The flora of the ecoregion shares many species with the moist forests of the Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas. From the Western Ghats this includes plants like Jackfruit and several lianas such as Schefflera Vine (schefflera venulosa), Joint Fir (gnetum ula), and common rattan. From the Eastern Himalayas this includes the peculiar Indian pepper tree and several shrubs, herbs and flowers such as Yellow Himalayan raspberry, False nettle (Boehmeria macrophylla), and Whipcord cobra lily among others. Several globally threatened plant species are found in this ecoregion, including the two endemic plants Leucas mukerjiana and Phlebophyllum jeyporensis.

File:Zanthoxylum rhetsa 6662.jpgPlants in common with the Eastern Himalayas spans a wide range of species (Indian pepper tree)  Fauna  Due to large intact forests, this ecoregion supports healthy populations of large mammals, including tigers. The ecoregion still harbours large intact areas of tropical moist deciduous forests and is therefore considered an important refuge and safe haven for healthy populations of most of the original large vertebrates associated with this habitat. Among the mammals, this includes the predators Indian tigers, wolves, dhole and sloth bear, and herbivores gaur, chousingha, blackbuck, and chinkara. The Asian elephants that once lived here, though, has been extirpated long ago. The only endemic species found in the ecoregion is the cave-dwelling Khajuria's leaf- nosed bat.

He eventually settled in Gull Lake, Saskatchewan where he became an alderman and then mayor from 1921 to 1925. Smith attempted to win a seat in the Saskatchewan legislature as a Liberal in 1934 but was defeated. He then moved to Kamloops, British Columbia where he raised cattle and grew hops as well as involving himself in selling automobile sales and heavy equipment. He organized several businesses, Sydney Smith Ltd., Sydney Smith U Drive Ltd., Sydmar Estates Ltd., and the Highway Equipment Co.

Smith entered British Columbia politics in the 1949 provincial election and was elected as MLA for the Kamloops riding for the British Columbia Liberal Party (then in a coalition with the Conservative Party) but was defeated after one term with much of the rest of the Coalition caucus (his successor in the Kamloops seat was Phil Gaglardi, part of what would become the new Social Credit cabinet). He served as president of the British Columbia Liberal Association from 1953 to 1959 and was summoned to the Senate on January 3, 1957 on the advice of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. He was appointed Speaker of the upper house in early 1966 on the advice of Lester Pearson and served for two years. He stepped down as Speaker in September 1968 and then resigned from the Senate on December 31 due to ill health. He died in Victoria, British Columbia in 1976.

Typically, all member universities in a university system share a common component among all of their various names. Usually, all member universities of a university system are governed by a system-wide governing body, such as a board of trustees or a board of regents. In the United States, many states have one or two state university systems under which many of their publicly funded universities are aligned, both in name and in governance. Additionally, for-profit universities, such as DeVry University, often have multiple campuses which share the same name; these may be, but are not always, described as a university system. In Canada, university system usually refers to the collection of all universities within a jurisdiction, as distinguished from other post-secondary institutions. Used as a point of comparison, it may refer to the universities within a province or within a country. In the UK, university system has been used to refer to the policy and practise of integrated administration and infrastructure of the universities within the country. In the Philippines, university system is a title granted by the Commission on Higher Education to a private or public higher education institution after complying certain requirements. The commission defines university system as an organized academic entity composed of separate but interrelated units, at least one of which has university level status. A single governing board is responsible for the formulation of system-wide policies and programs. A university system has its own system administration headed by a chief executive officer. Its function is to coordinate and integrate system-wide functions and activities. Each constituent unit has its own chief executive officer to whom broad powers is delegated by the governing board for the organization and operation of the constituent unit.CHED Memorandum Order No. 8 Series of 2003 issued by the Commission on Higher Education of the Republic of the Philippines.

The park, established in 1969, covers about 4.62 km2 (18.00 mi2). Mount Harriet (), which is part of the park, is the third-highest peak in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago next to Saddle Peak () in North Andaman and Mount Thullier () in Great Nicobar. The picture on the back side of ‚Çπ 20 note is taken from Mount Harriet National Park. The park is named in commemoration of Harriet C. Tytler, the second wife of Robert Christopher Tytler, a British army officer, an administrator, naturalist and photographer, who was appointed Superintendent of the Convict Settlement at Port Blair in the Andamans from April 1862 to February 1864. Harriet is remembered for her work in documenting the monuments of Delhi and for her notes at the time of the Revolt of 1857 in India. The park's well- known faunal species are Andaman wild pigs (an endangered species), saltwater crocodiles, turtles and robber crabs. The park is also a butterfly hotspot. Geography Mount Harriet National Park was originally a reserve forest which was converted into a national park in 1979. It encompasses an area of , which is likely to be extended to cover an additional area of to include adjoining mountain ranges and the marine ecosystem on the eastern coast. The mountains in the park are aligned in a north-south direction with the ridges and spurs originating from it aligned in an east-west direction. The park's elevation range is from zero at the coast to the peak level of . The eastern face of the park has steep slopes, and the beaches here are also formed of rocks interspersed with small sandy areas. The park is drained by many streams which rise in the hills and flow into the sea on the east. The park experiences marine climatic conditions, and hot and humid conditions in view of its proximity to the equator. A notable feature away from the park is Kalapathar, where prisoners used to be pushed down the ravine to their death. The park is at a distance of from Port Blair, the capital of the union territory, which also has an airport. Trekking through the park is popular as it passes through an attractive beach; one can watch endemic avifauna, animals, and butterflies that fly around, and also see elephants carrying lumber. The tribal community living in the tropical forest of the park are the Negrito people, who are hunter-gatherers. Flora The park has evergreen primary forests, and at Chiriyatapu the forest type is mixed deciduous, a combination of primary and secondary forests. The three types of forests are categorized as tropical evergreen, hilltop tropical evergreen and littoral. Overall 134 plant and tree species are reported, including 74 native and 51 introduced species. Some of the plant species of the tropical variety are:Dipterocarpus gracilis, Dipterocarpus grandiflorus, Dipterocarpus kerrii, Endospermum chinensis, and Hopea odorata including Araucaria columnaris which is a conifer native to Caledonia Islands. Plant species of the hilltop tropical variety are Canarium manii, Cratoxylum formosum, and Dipterocarpus costatus. The littoral forest species are mainly Manilkara littoralis and Moringa citrifolia. Trekking along the path from Bambooflat to the mountain top at , trees are seen with hanging vines. Fauna Andaman tree nymph Pseudocalotes andamanensis Avifauna identified by Bird Life International include seven 'near threatened' species which are: the Andaman wood pigeon (Columba palumboides), Andaman cuckoo-dove (Macropygia rufipennis), Andaman scops-owl (Otus balli), Andaman boobook (Ninox affinis), Andaman woodpecker (Dryocopus hodgei), Andaman drongo (Dicrurus andamanensis), and Andaman treepie (Dendrocitta bayleyi); there are also two species of 'least concern', which are the Andaman coucal (Centropus andamanensis) and white-headed starling (Sturnus erythropygius). Introduced species include the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and chital (Axis axis) apart from ferals. There are 28 reptile species recorded (including 14 species endemic to the Andamans) which are mostly lizards and snakes. The amphibian fauna reported are 6 species; 2 species of Andaman bull frog (Kaloula baleata ghoshi) and Andaman paddy field frog (Limnonectes andamanensis) are endemic. The aquatic fauna reported from the streams consist of 16 species; some of these species are eel, catfish, gobies, sleepers and snakeheads. The land molluscs consist of six species. The invertebrate species reported are 355 which include insects to the extent of 70%. The well-known insect silkmoth, Samia cynthia, has been recorded in the park in lowland forest areas up to . In addition, larvae of Samia fulva were noted eating the leaves of Zanthoxylum rhetsa (Rutaceae) and Heteropanax fragrans (Araliaceae).

The acronym SER stands for Sociedad Espa√±ola de Radiodifusi√≥n (Spanish Broadcasting Company). Cadena SER's programmes ‚Äì which encompass news, sport, talk, entertainment and culture ‚Äì can be received throughout Spain. The network's main studios are located on the Gran V√≠a in Madrid; in addition, studios across the country contribute local and regional news and information, with local programming in each location amounting to between 2 and 3.5 hours daily. Cadena SER is owned by Uni√≥n Radio, the majority shareholder in which is currently the PRISA group, a major player in the Spanish media market which also controls, for example, such music radio stations as LOS40, Cadena Dial, Radiol√© and a number of newspapers (including the influential national daily El Pa√≠s), as well as other media in Spanish-speaking countries around the world. History At 18.30 on Friday, 14 November 1924, station EAJ-1 Radio Barcelona, the first Spanish radio station to receive an official licence from the government of General Miguel Primo de Rivera, began regular broadcasting. Seven months later, on 17 June 1925, Uni√≥n Radio ‚Äì a company which had the backing of the leading manufacturers of electrical and broadcasting equipment in Spain, Germany, and the United States ‚Äì opened station EAJ-7 Radio Madrid, and when, on 10 November 1926, this same company also took over the ownership of Radio Barcelona, the foundations were in place for the formation of Spain's first national radio network. By 1927 Uni√≥n Radio was operating not only Radio Madrid and Radio Barcelona, but also EAJ-5 Radio Sevilla, EAJ-9 Radio Bilbao, and EAJ-22 Radio Salamanca, enabling all of these stations to broadcast simultaneous, i.e. networked, programming for most of their time on air, with Radio Madrid as the chief production centre. Through the remaining years of the monarchy (until 1930), and during the Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì39), Uni√≥n Radio continued to be Spain's only nationwide radio network. Uni√≥n Radio created Spain's first national radio news programme La Palabra (\\"The Word\\"), broadcast several times daily. However, from 1939 until 1977, under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco and the initial part of the transition to democracy, the network was forbidden from carrying any national news programming other than the compulsory twice-daily relays of the official news bulletins prepared by the government-controlled Radio Nacional de Espa√±a. On 25 September 1940, ownership of Uni√≥n Radio was transferred to the newly constituted Sociedad Espa√±ola de Radiodifusi√≥n (\\"Spanish Broadcasting Company\\"), and the network renamed itself Cadena SER. In 1975, 25% of the shares in the network were compulsorily acquired by the Spanish state, and in 1984 most of the remaining shares were purchased by the PRISA media conglomerate. The nationalized shares were subsequently sold back to the private sector (in effect, to PRISA) under the premiership of Felipe Gonz√°lez in 1992. The network played a significant role in the period of transition to democracy following the death of Franco and in the years leading up to and immediately following the adoption of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, notably in its coverage of the attempted coup of 23 February 1981. Cadena SER also played a vital journalistic role with its reporting of the events and circumstances of the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Politics Cadena SER, along with other media in the PRISA group, is considered to be close to Spain's centre-left political party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). There have been many disputes with the other main privately owned radio network in Spain, the right-wing Cadena COPE, which is owned by the Catholic Church. Sports Cadena SER is also the leader in radio sports coverage. The network covers every match in La Liga, in the UEFA Champions League games whenever a Spanish team is playing, and matches involving the Spain national football team. Notable programmes Notable programmes on Cadena SER include Hoy por hoy, broadcasting news and current affairs in the morning, which was first aired on 22 September 1986; El Larguero (the late nightly sports programme, on air since 1989); Hablar por hablar, a talk show first broadcast in 1989 for Radio Barcelona; El Mundo Today for comedy, and Carrusel Deportivo for sports, Spain's oldest, and still remaining, radio programme dating to 1952.

Several Noctilien Buses at Paris-Gare de Lyon hub bus station (Rue de Bercy) All in all, Noctilien operates 48 bus lines, from the end of the rail network and day bus service (around 00:30) until their resumption early in the morning (around 05:30), over the whole of Paris and the √éle-de-France region. It is made up of: * 2 circular lines: & running between Paris' major train stations ; * 6 transversal lines: from to running between different suburbs of Paris via its center at Ch√¢telet ; * 21 radial lines (the other 2 digits lines, except N71) running between major Paris stations and more or less its near suburbs ; * 2 radial long distance lines: & (subcontracted by the RATP) running between Paris and its remote suburbs ; * 15 radial long distance lines (the other 3 digits lines, except N135) running between Paris and its remote suburbs (with often a partly motorway route) and managed by the Transilien SNCF ; * 2 ring lines in the suburbs: by RATP & by Transilien SNCF. Like Transilien, the name \\"Noctilien\\" is formed by analogy with \\"Francilien\\" -- the French demonym for residents of √éle-de-France.

It is the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde ‚Äì a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì to which it also belongs. Geography=Location The town lies in the Eifel some 11 km northwest of Cochem. Constituent communities To Ulmen belong the outlying centres ‚Äì Stadtteile ‚Äì of Meiserich, Vorpochten and Furth.  Geology  The Ulmener Maar, only about 11,000 years old, is not only a maar but also Continental Europe‚Äôs newest volcano north of the Alps. It is 37 m deep. Volcanic activity can be observed at depths of more than 4 m in the form of rising gas bubbles. The Ulmener Maar has no natural water inflow or outflow. The two tunnels that hold the water at a constant level today were dug in the 19th century. Another maar in town is the 118,000-year-old Jungferweiher, which is considerably bigger than the Ulmener Maar. Formerly used as a fishpond for the lords of the castle, it dried up over the centuries until in the 1930s, it had become a peat bog. In 1942, however, the maar was flooded once again to regulate the water level in the nearby maar. History In 1074, Ulmen had its first documentary mention, though Merovingian graves south of the castle bear witness to earlier habitation within town limits. There have also been suspected Roman finds, but these have not yet been verified. Sir Heinrich von Ulmen, a knight, went on the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople, whence he brought valuable treasures back, among others the famous Limburger Staurothek (‚ÄúLimburg Reliquary of the True Cross‚Äù), which can still be seen in the cathedral in Limburg an der Lahn. His successors were in the 15th century subject to the Trier Archiepiscopal Foundation's public peace (Landfrieden). The ‚ÄúSun King‚Äù Louis XIV of France conquered Ulmen twice and burnt it down. Both times, the castle and the town were built up again. Beginning in 1794, Ulmen lay under French rule. In 1815 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate. Many old buildings bear witness even today to Ulmen's historical past. In the 19th century, when buildings confiscated by Napoleon were transferred to Prussian ownership, a Cochem townsman bought the castle and used it as a quarry. When Ulmen all but burnt down in a fire in 1831, the houses were rebuilt using stones from the castle. Since then, it has been a ruin. In the forest that abuts the town is an old spring near which some Roman and Celtic figures were found. This spring is called Dietzjes B√§rechje, a reference to children; for centuries, women prayed here for a good birth and healthy children. In 1376, Ulmen was granted town rights by Emperor Karl IV.Otto Beck: Beschreibung des Regierungsbezirks Trier, 1868, Seite 57 These rights were, however, lost as the Prussians took over the Rhineland in 1815. By decision of the Rhineland-Palatinate Cabinet on 1 September 2009, Ulmen was once again allowed to bear the designation Stadt (‚Äútown‚Äù) with effect from 2 October 2009.Eifel Zeitung: Ulmen erh√§lt Stadtrechte, 1.

All are set just before and during the \\"Third Pass\\", about 500 years after human settlement on Pern and 2000 years before the \\"Ninth Pass\\" events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books. Plot summary The story tells how the people of the fictional planet Pern discover the special abilities of the watch-whers or whers, a distant relative of the dragons. Subsequently, these beasts are used in mines to warn miners of gas pockets and also to locate stranded miners, should there be a cave-in. The story begins some years before the 3rd Pass in Camp Natalon, a mining camp. There, the reader is introduced to a young boy Kindan, whose father owns a watch-wher called Dask. During a mining cave-in, Kindan loses his entire family as well as Dask, and is adopted by the Master Harper Zist, who begins to train him to be both an entertainer and a spy, something that Harpers do. This is how Kindan learns that the camp is divided into two parties, Natalon's and his uncle Tarik's. Meanwhile, the camp is without a watch-wher and minor accidents keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tarik and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of coal for a chance for Kindan to ask a queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins the difficult task of raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train the watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, towards the end of the novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon.

Malley was named whip, a position of expanded importance in a legislature with such close numbers. He was widely called upon by leaders in his community to leave the government in 2004 if the Lord government did not back away from rumoured health care cuts in the region. In the end the cuts were not as severe as had been rumoured and Malley remained in caucus. On February 17, 2006, shortly after a cabinet shuffle, Malley announced he would leave the Conservative caucus to sit as an independent. He expressed disappointment in the government's overall direction and in his not being included in cabinet despite being the only representative of Miramichi in the Conservative caucus He argued that whereas Miramichi is the province's fourth largest city and where the three larger cities have significant representation (Moncton with 4, Saint John with 3 and Fredericton with 3), Miramichi ought to have had a member in the cabinet. His argument here was somewhat flawed, in that the cities proper have 2, 1 and 1 respectively, the numbers above include surrounding areas; the Miramichi area, if viewed through the same lens, has one cabinet member in Rogersville-Kouchibouguac MLA Rose-May Poirier. Premier Bernard Lord has alleged Malley had less savory motives for leaving Lord's governing Conservative party. Lord alleged at a news conference that Malley made five specific demands in exchange for staying with the Conservatives, including: more money for his constituency office, more help for the Miramichi's troubled paper mill and the appointment of a female friend as his special assistant . Lord further alleged that Malley demanded he immediately appoint Fredericton lawyer Cleveland Allaby, who Lord called a \\"good friend\\" of Mr. Malley's, as provincial court judge in the Miramichi. Allaby, however, denied this allegation and Lord admitted that he had no proof of any of the alleged demands. Malley has also denied these allegations. Malley's floor crossing was especially significant because it changed Lord's Progressive Conservative government from a majority to a minority with the standings becoming: Progressive Conservatives 27, opposition Liberal Party 26 and two independents including Malley and former Liberal Frank Branch. When Malley announced he was leaving the Conservatives, he stated that he would use his new position of influence to support legislation that helps the poor people of New Brunswick and residents of the Miramichi region. Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick On March 28, 2006, Malley was acclaimed as Speaker of the Legislature after Tony Huntjens, the nominee of Bernard Lord, withdrew his name. Electing Malley as speaker, a position in which one only votes in the case of a tie, instead of a member of the government caucus, provides the government considerable more flexibility. Though still technically a minority government, by tradition, should there be a tie on a vote of confidence, the Speaker would vote in favour of the government. On April 13, 2006, Malley announced he was rejoining the Progressive Conservative caucus, though as Speaker he would not attend caucus meetings and he would remain impartial. Liberal leader Shawn Graham and New Democratic Party leader Allison Brewer (whose party is not currently represented in the legislature, but was from 1991 to 2005) criticized the decision. Graham said Malley was making the legislature the \\"laughing stock\\" of the Commonwealth because of the unusual and unprecedented move of a, by definition, non-partisan Speaker announcing from his chair his change in partisan affiliation. Brewer said a mockery was being made of office of speaker. As Malley remains only able to vote in the case of a tie, the actual status of the legislature is unchanged with 27 ordinally voting members of the government, 27 members of the opposition and an impartial Speaker. The significance of this move, however, is a motion passed by the legislature in 2003 which requires the opposition withhold a vote on committees on which the government does not have a majority in order to \\"preserve the government majority\\". Premier Benard Lord argues he now has a majority again and the opposition should honour the terms of that motion while the Opposition has said that they do not recognize a change of affiliation from a speaker in the chair and will still operate as if the government were in a minority situation until such time as the Speaker resigns, sits among the Conservative caucus and re-offers for his office as a Conservative. Through much of May, the Government and Opposition began to negotiate to bring some order back to the legislature. With only two parties represented, the tight numbers make it difficult for the Government to pass some of its agenda through the House and they had proposed radical rule changes to increase their majority inside of legislative committees. The Liberals opposed this saying it would turn the legislature into little more than a rubber stamp. A counter proposal offered by the Liberals was to see Malley resign as speaker and, in exchange, the Liberals would allow one of their members to stand for the post therefore increasing the working majority of the government by 2 votes. In exchange for this, the Liberals wanted an early election in the fall of 2006. Though the Conservative Government rejected this offer, the Liberals and Conservatives began negotiations which included the possibility of removing Malley from office. On May 24, 2006, Government House Leader Bev Harrison, Malley's predecessor as Speaker, said the government would not force Malley from office but, were he still Speaker, he would resign to resolve the deadlock. Malley has refused to comment to the media on this situation. A vote on May 30, 2006 to remove Malley from office was defeated 27 to 25. Later however fellow Progressive Conservative Peter Mesheau announced his plans to resign from the legislature and rather than face another minority, Bernard Lord called an election. Malley sought re-election against Bill Fraser, the man who led the protests against hospital cuts in Malley's region. In the general provincial election of September 18, 2006, Malley lost his seat to Liberal challenger Bill Fraser. Malley was soundly defeated, trailing his opponent by better than 20 percent in the popular vote. Following his defeat, Malley was expected to continue to receive a salary as Speaker, though not as MLA, until a new Speaker is elected on February 6, 2007. This attracted some controversy.

Geography It covers an area of , mostly in western Odisha state, with portions in neighboring Chhattisgarh. The region extends northeast-southwest in the dry western rain shadow of the Eastern Ghats range, which block the moisture-laden monsoon winds from the Bay of Bengal to the east. It is surrounded by the more humid Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests ecoregion. The ecoregion lies mostly in the middle basin of the Mahanadi River and its tributary the Tel. The southern portion of the ecoregion lies in the upper basin of the Indravati River, a tributary of the Godavari. Flora The original vegetation was a multi-storied forest of mostly dry-season deciduous trees, dominated by sal (Shorea robusta). Little of the original forest remains. Teak (Tectona grandis), which favors drier conditions, is more common in the remaining forests. Frequent fires, intensive grazing, and over-harvesting trees for firewood and fodder has reduced other areas to open scrubland or savanna. Much of the ecoregion has been converted to agriculture or pasture. Conservation A 1997 assessment found that more than three-quarters of the ecoregion's natural habitat had been cleared or degraded. Four protected areas encompassed about 2.5 percent of the ecoregion's area.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

It is located in the eastern outskirts of the city and is divided into microregions. Poduyane consists of the neighbourhoods Suhata Reka, Hadzhi Dimitar, Poduyane, Stefan Karadzha, Levski, Levski-G, Levski-V. A former village, it was incoroparted in 1895. The district's holiday is celebrated on 1 June.  History  alt= Poduene was first mentioned in 1453 as Poduyani. The name is derived from the word poduy, an adjective from pod (\\"soil\\") with the now-unproductive suffix ‚Äìuy. In that case poduy was a geographical term referring to a high flat country or a plain country at the foot of a hill. Poduene was the first village to be included within the city of Sofia in 1895 and was mentioned in the Elin Pelin works. In 1920s the neighbourhoods of Suha Reka and Hadzhi Dimitar were established and experienced a quick population growth mainly from north-western Bulgaria. Many streets are still named after villages from the region such as Gintsi, Todorini Kukli, Petrohan and others. During socialism (1944-1989) Poduene along with two other districts (Oborishte and Slatina) formed the 5th district \\"Vasil Levski\\" of the capital. In the 1960s, 1970s and especially 1980s many panel blocks were constructed in the neighbourhoods of Suha Reka, Hadzhi Dimitar, Poduene and Stefan Karadzha. In the end of the 1980s a new neighbourhood Metalurg was built and in 1999 it was renamed to Levski V and G after its incorporation into Poduene from Kremikovtsi.  Population  Poduene has 85,996 inhabitants which makes it the third most populous district in Sofia after Lyulin and Mladost. According to the 2001 census the population was 75,004 - 25,000 lived in Hadzhi Dimitar and Stefan Karadzha; 25,000 in Suha Reka and Poduyane (neighbourhood); 15,000 in Levski V and G and 10,000 in Levski.

In the Suha Reka neighbourhood is located Georgi Asparuhov Stadium (also known as Gerena) home of PFC Levski Sofia.  Transport  Poduyane railway station is located within the district.  Territorial structure  The district of Poduene is surrounded by railways. The main railway is the international one which separates the district from the center. There are two rivers, Perlovska and Slatinska, while the Vladayska river serves as administrative border with Serdika. The Vladimir Vazov Boulevard which follows the Perlovska river divides the district into two parts: * North-western - the neighbourhoods of Hadzhi Dimitar, Stefan Karadzja and Levski-G * South-eastern - the neighbourhoods of Poduene, Suhata Reka, Levski and Levski-V There are two mixed neighbourhoods with blocks and houses - Hadzhi Dimitar and Suhata Reka, two neighbourhoods with blocks - Levski V and G and one neighbourhood with houses - Levski. Poduene can be considered as part of Suhata Reka while Stefan Karadszha forms part of Hadzhi Dimitar.  Honour  Poduene Glacier on Danco Coast, Antarctica is named after Poduene.

He served as Minister of Veterans Affairs from 1972 to 1979 and again in 1980 until his death. Life He was born on his family's farm in Bothwell, Prince Edward Island and was educated in a one-room schoolhouse. At the age of 20, he bought his own farm at Bothwell Beach. In 1940, he enlisted in The Prince Edward Island Highlanders to fight in World War II. He was transferred to the Cape Breton Highlanders in 1943 and fought with the rank of sergeant in Italy, where he was wounded during the assault on the Gothic Line. He returned to his unit after a few weeks and was seriously wounded on December 21, 1944, during the Battle of Senio River. As a result, his left arm and leg were amputated. Undiscouraged by his injuries, he returned to his farm, married a local woman named Pauline Peters, built a house, and raised seven children: Blair, Heather, Gail, Daniel, Leo, Walter, and Gloria. The singer-songwriter Jenn Grant is a granddaughter. Political career In 1962, he was elected to the Prince Edward Island House of Assembly and sat in the body for ten years. He served as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry from 1966 to 1972, when he resigned to run in the 1972 federal election. Elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Cardigan, he was appointed to the Cabinet of Pierre Trudeau as Minister of Veterans Affairs. He was defeated in the 1979 federal election but returned in the 1980 election and was then reappointed to the Veterans Affairs portfolio. MacDonald reformed veterans' pensions to make them more generous and introduced disability pensions and pensions for prisoners of war. In the late 1970s, Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau undertook an initiative to decentralize government away from Ottawa. He and MacDonald devised the plan to move the headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs from Ottawa to Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The department's head office, along with the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, have been located in the Daniel J. MacDonald Building (the \\"DJM\\") in PEI's capital ever since. (In the early 21st century, a second building two blocks from the DJM, the Jean Canfield Building (the \\"JCB\\"), was constructed to house other federal government offices, including some from Veterans Affairs Canada.) The department has become a major economic contributor to PEI, and has had an important impact on Charlottetown's cultural landscape. MacDonald died in office on September 30, 1980 and was given a state funeral. The eulogy was given by Prime Minister Trudeau at St. Dunstan's Cathedral, in Charlottetown.

Once home to 20,000 ethnic Chinese, its population dropped to around 2,000 as of 2009 as a result of multiple factors including repatriation and denial of Indian citizenship following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and immigration to foreign countries for better economic opportunities. The Chinese community traditionally worked in the local tanning industry and ran Chinese restaurants. Iraqis A Parsi gentleman in Kolkata Iraqis first arrived in Kolkata during late 19th century from Eastern Uttar Pradesh state of India.Today majority are in the leather work of the city. Most of them live in areas of Park Circus and Topsia. The present Iraqi population in Kolkata is estimated to be 10,000. Jewish Kolkata's Jews are mostly Baghdadi Jews who came to Kolkata to trade. At one point as strong as 6000, the community has dwindled to about 60 after the formation of Israel. Today there are only about 30 Jews left in Kolkata. The first recorded Jewish immigrant to Kolkata was Shalon Cohen in 1798 from Aleppo in present-day Syria. The most influential Jewish family in Kolkata was perhaps the father-son real estate magnates David Joseph Ezra and Elia David Ezra. They were behind such buildings as the Chowringhee Mansions, Esplanade Mansions and the synagogue Neveh Shalom.the family also were instrumental in the founding of the Jewish Girls School. Ezra Street in Kolkata is named after them. The community has five independent synagogues in Kolkata, including one in Chinatown, some of which are still active today.

They were known as the \\"Merchant Princes of India\\", and some settled in Emperor Akbar's court. Some finally settled in Serampore and Kolkata, supposedly under the invitation of Job Charnock. Among notable Armenians, Sir Apcar Alexander Apcar, a prominent businessman, was the head of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The size of the Armenian community can be testified by the five Armenian cemeteries in Kolkata, including the one adjunct to the Chapel of Holy Trinity in Tangra and an Armenian church. A gift of Rs. 8000 by Asvatoor Mooradkhan helped found the Armenian College in 1821. Armenian College has been instrumental in pioneering the game of rugby on the Maidan turf. The grave of Astwasatoor Mooradkhan The Armenians settled in a block close to Free School Street, which even to this day is called Armani-para (\\"the neighbourhood of the Armenians\\"). They have mostly assimilated into the Indian population, and the community has now been reduced to a handful of houses. Tibetan The Tibetans were initially annual winter visitors to Kolkata who, along with the Bhutias, vended woollens. Post 1951, Kolkata became home to quite a few Tibetans who used the porous Sikkim- Tibet border to get to Kolkata. Winter sees large numbers of Tibetans set up winter garment streetside shops in the area around Wellington Square. The Tibetan community has also contributed to a large number of Tibetan restaurants serving ethnic Tibetan cuisine. Tibetan medicine is well accepted in Kolkata as alternative therapy to terminal illnesses. Afghans Kolkata was a popular desination for Afghan (including Pathan) businessmen from Afghanistan in the 19th century, vending spices and fruits. They are locally known as the Kabuliwala, named after the 1892 story which tells the story of a migrant from Kabul to Kolkata, and are also nicknamed as the Khans like elsewhere in India. Greek The Greeks emigrated to India after the Ottoman and Turkish invasions in the 16th century. Kolkata had a sizeable Greek community, mostly a close-knit clan of noble families from the Greek island of Chios, pursuing trade with the British. The firm of Ralli Brothers is perhaps the most common Greek name in Kolkata; the Rallis sold their firm in the 1960s after Indian independence and moved away, like most of the Greek community. The firm is now known as Ralli India, under the Tata Group of companies. The Greek community was centred on Amratollah Street around the Greek Church of the Transfiguration (built in 1782). The most famous Greek to hail from Kolkata possibly was the gifted violinist Marie Nicachi who embarked on a European tour in 1910 and played at the courts of Emperor Franz Josef of Austria and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. She settled in her familial home of Corfu after World War I. The Greek contribution to the city will be remembered by the pioneering social work at the Greek Orthodox Church and the Panioty Fountain in the Maidan--named after Demetrius Panioty, personal secretary to the \\"friend of India,\\" Lord Ripon.

Longslade was created at a time of innovation in Leicestershire with regard to education. Leicestershire had created what was to be known as the Leicestershire Plan. Education authorities are not renowned from learning from each other but Leicestershire received delegations from half of the other authorities in England as well as attention from the USA to see the novel changes in Educational policy that they introduced. The school population in Leicestershire was expanding. In 1948 there were just under 44,000 children in Leicestershire but this had expanded to over 72,000 by 1968. This was not just population growth but movement from Leicester to the outlying suburbs like Oadby, Wigston and included in this list was Birstall. The county was setting out on what was to be known as the Leicestershire plan for comprehensive education. Where other schools in England were converting existing grammar schools and secondary modern schools to comprehensive education by changing their intake, Leicestershire decided to change the age of entry. Some schools were converted into what they called high schools that served ages 11 to 14 whilst others were converted into upper schools that educated children from age 14 to 18. This idea had been tried out experimentally in Oadby and Wigston in 1957 and the second phase was in 1960 taking in high schools in Scraptoft (Hamilton High), Thurmaston and with both a high and upper school on the new site between Birstall and Wanlip. Previously a community school administered by Leicestershire County Council, in 2015 Longslade Community College converted to academy status and was renamed The Cedars Academy. At the same time the school expanded its age range to 11, becoming a full secondary school. This resulted in the closure of Stonehill High School. Admissions The school serves a large catchment area including the villages of Anstey, Birstall, Cropston, Glenfield, Rothley, Thurcaston and Wanlip.Official site School web site The school also provides adult education and special needs education. Academic performance For a number of years, its results were well below average.

Early life The second son of Thomas Corbett, a Glasgow merchant and philanthropist, and Sarah (n√©e Cameron),Rowallan: the autobiography of Lord Rowallan, Paul Harris Publishing Ltd, 1976, p. 5. he was educated at home and at the Glasgow Academy. With his older brother Thomas, he took up the offer of a world tour rather than go to university. On his return, he briefly studied sculpture in South Kensington and then managed his father's estates in Essex which he bought from his uncle after his father's death in 1880. He became one of the principal developers of the eastern suburbs of London.Rowallan: the autobiography of Lord Rowallan, Paul Harris Publishing Ltd, 1976, pp. 7‚Äì12. Political career An interest in philanthropy led him into politics and first contested North Warwickshire in 1884 at the age of 28. At the 1885 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Tradeston, first as a Liberal and from 1886 as a Liberal Unionist. In August 1908 he crossed the floor of the House and rejoined the Liberal Party. He held Glasgow Tradeston until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1911, when he was created 1st Baron Rowallan, of Rowallan in the County of Ayr. Family life In 1887, he married Alice Mary Polson, a daughter of John Polson, the co-founder of the corn merchants firm of Brown & Polson.

It was released on Capitol Records in 1967. Background After a troubled youth that saw him in and out of youth reformatories, Haggard was finally sent to Bakersfield jail for a bungled robbery and, after an escape attempt, transferred to San Quentin prison on February 21, 1958. He was released in 1960. By 1967, he was on the cusp of country stardom when he hit number one on the country singles chart with the Liz Anderson composition \\"I'm A Lonesome Fugitive.\\" Understandably, Haggard was concerned about the effect his time in prison might have on his career but, as Daniel Cooper writes in the liner notes to the 1994 box set Down Every Road, it had little effect at all: \\"It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement.Down Every Road 1962‚Äì1994 compilation album. Liner notes by Daniel Cooper In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned. But in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge.\\" Haggard would be legally pardoned for his past crimes by California's Governor Ronald Reagan in 1971. Recording and composition The single \\"Branded Man\\" hit number one on the US country music charts in 1967, the first of four straight number ones Haggard would score in the next two years. The song is a little reminiscent of an old Roy Acuff song called \\"Branded Wherever I Go,\\" which producer Ken Nelson had recorded with the Louvin Brothers in 1962. Branded Man kicked off an incredible artistic run for Haggard; in 2013 Haggard biographer David Cantwell states, \\"The immediate successors to I'm a Lonesome Fugitive - Branded Man in 1967 and, in '68, Sing Me Back Home and The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde - were among the finest albums of their respective years.\\" Haggard wrote or co-wrote seven of the album's twelve tracks, which feature many of the same session players who appeared on his previous two albums, including guitarists James Burton and Glen Campbell, and steel guitarist Ralph Mooney. Also contributing were The Strangers guitarist Roy Nichols and Bonnie Owens. Owens co-wrote two of the album selections with Haggard, while Bakersfield pioneer and Haggard mentor Tommy Collins had a hand in writing four songs. Ken Nelson took a hands-off approach to producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: \\"The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was an exception to the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty- four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale...He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me.\\" In the same documentary, Dave Alvin marvels, \\"There's a purity to those records. A couple of acoustic guitars, a couple of electric guitars, and Merle's voice. And bass and drums. Those are just pure, those are timeless.\\" In the documentary Beyond Nashville, Nelson recalls, \\"When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs - he was a great writer.\\" The follow up to \\"Branded Man\\" was the Haggard-penned \\"I Threw Away the Rose,\\" which rose to number 2, and it was this song that brought Haggard to the attention of George Jones. In his 1981 autobiography Merle Haggard: Sing Me Back Home, Haggard recalls playing somewhere in Texas when someone handed him a phone saying Jones was on the line. Jones slurred his appreciation for the song and said he was coming to see him immediately. \\"It wasn't hard to see that ol' George was pretty wasted,\\" Haggard wrote. \\"I hung up the phone and some of the others in the room said they wouldn't be surprised if he showed up. I told them I didn't think so, 'cause hell, he was supposed to be doing concerts all week.\\" The next day Jones arrived, kicking the door in and eventually folding up the roll-away bed that Haggard's sleeping manager Fuzzy Owen was on and wheeling it out of the room. Jones would record \\"I Threw Away the Rose\\" himself, as well as several other Haggard compositions over the course of his career, and the pair would record two duet albums together. Critical reception Branded Man topped the Billboard country albums chart. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote \\"Like Swinging Doors before it, Branded Man... is merely a collection of songs pieced together to cash in on a couple of hit singles. Nevertheless, the intent of an album such as this doesn't really matter when the songs are this fine.\\" In 2003, the album was ranked number 484 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums.

It was one of the most successful anti-aircraft guns to see service during the conflict. The designation \\"90/53\\" meant that the gun had a 90 mm caliber and a barrel 53 caliber-lengths long.  History = Naval version  In 1938, after a development period, the Ansaldo company produced a new heavy AA gun for the Regia Marina, to replace the obsolescent ≈†koda 10 cm K10 and K11 used for that role on Italian warships; initially 48 calibers long, it was eventually brought to 50 calibers. The Cannone da 90/50 Ansaldo Model 1938 and OTO Model 1939 had an autofretted monobloc barrel with a screwed-on breech ring containing the horizontal sliding breech block and seatings for the recoil and run-out cylinders. The most interesting part of the weapon was the single quadriaxal mounting designed for it: those were pre-stabilized, with a complex system controlled by 11 gyros, with two electric motors providing the necessary RPC; the whole complex was enclosed in an oval shielded turret, mainly to protect it from the blast effects from the battleship's main caliber guns. The turret weighed some 20 tons, and the practical rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute. After testing on the armoured cruiser San Giorgio, the 90/50 was fitted on the new Littorio-class battleships and the two Andrea Doria-class battleships being rebuilt, for a respective total of 12 and 10 mountings. This system has been described as too advanced and being ahead of its day, and in fact, while ballistically the gun had good performance, the mountings proved delicate, and in the Andrea Doria-class battleships the electrical RPC motors were removed in 1942 because of water damage; on the Littorio-class battleships, where the mountings were placed higher, the RPC was retained. Also, early rounds tended to be flawed and fragment into very small pieces, reducing their effectiveness, although improved rounds were issued during the war.Campbell, p. 341-2Bagnasco, p. 64-7 After the war, guns from the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto were assigned to Yugoslavia as a part of war reparations. They were mounted on a coastal artillery battery on island ≈Ωirje off ≈†ibenik as a part of the Cold War defense strategy. Two 90/53 cannons saw action in September 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence, deterring Yugoslav People's Army attack on ≈†ibenik and blocking 34 Yugoslav Navy's patrol boats and minesweepers which were later captured by Croatian forces in the inner harbor.  Land version  Cannone da 90/53 on Lancia truck abandoned by Rommel's army in February 1943 The Cannone da 90/53, derived from the naval version,Bagnasco, p. 66-7 was also designed by Ansaldo, with the first examples being produced in 1939. The original plan was for the gun to be manufactured in three variants: * The Modello 41P was for static emplacement; 1,087 were ordered. * The Modello 41C was to be towed; 660 were ordered. * 57 were ordered to be mounted on heavy trucks designated autocannoni da 90/53. Italian industry was not up to producing these quantities and by the end of production in July 1943 only 539 guns had been delivered, including 48 converted for use on the Semovente 90/53 heavy tank destroyer; some, owing to delays in producing the adequate mountings, were fitted on makeshift ones or on the flatbed of trucks like the Lancia 3Ro and the Breda 52 and were designated Autocannone Breda 52 da 90/53. Drawing upon the German experience with the comparable 8.8 cm FlaK 18, this gun was also used as field artillery in the indirect fire role or as an anti-tank gun; in the latter role its performance was excellent, with its AP shell being able to pierce of armour at , and at , some other source even quote penetration of up to , thus being able to destroy every Allied tank it could face in North Africa and in the mainland. After Italy surrendered, guns captured by Wehrmacht forces were designated 9-cm Flak 41(i) or 9-cm Flak 309/1(i). Some of these guns were used for the air defence of Germany, while others were kept in service in Italy.

Paul appeared between 2004 and 2009. He arrives as the son of existing characters Val Lambert (Charlie Hardwick) and Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) and in 2008 Paul, who is openly gay, enters into a civil partnership with Jonny Foster, the first of any primetime soap opera. In 2015, Bose made brief returns to the show, on two separate occasions, one being in March and the other being in September. Character creation and development When Paul arrives in the village, he is the only gay male in the programme. While Bose said he liked \\"being the only gay in Emmerdale\\", he did not want Paul to be defined by his sexuality. In a February 2008 interview, Bose said that he thought about leaving after a storyline where Paul has a one-night stand with a married man, Grayson Sinclair (Christopher Villiers), saying that he did not believe Paul would have done that. He also criticised the storyline saying, \\"It makes out that all gay men are promiscuous and I don't think they are any more promiscuous than anyone else.\\" The actor said that the audience \\"distrust why shows are doing things then start not to like the character's story and it is hard to win them back.\\" After he \\"kicked up a fuss\\", he said the storyline \\"seems to have been dropped\\", but said that he would give it a few months before deciding whether to stay with the programme. In September 2008, it was announced that Matthew Bose would be leaving Emmerdale. He said that he had \\"had a brilliant time\\" playing Paul but felt it was time to \\"explore new projects\\". He said it was a \\"personal decision\\", and played down press rumours about low morale amongst the cast and denied they were unhappy with series producer Anita Turner. Turner said that it was \\"always disappointing to see great actors go\\" and that the door would be \\"open for him to come back at any time\\". On 17 February 2015, it was announced that Bose was returning to the show for a brief stint, On 11 August 2015, it was announced that Bose was returning for the funeral of his mother, Val. Paul returned on 1 September, before departing again on 2 September. Storylines Paul arrives in the village in September 2004, for his aunt, Diane Blackstock's (Elizabeth Estensen), wedding to Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) after leaving Italy having split from his partner of nine years Enzo (Daniel D'Alessandro). He is reunited with his mother Val (Charlie Hardwick) who is living in the village and has not seen Paul for years and he gives her a hostile reception. Paul returns to Italy to try to fix his relationship with Enzo, who later visits the village, but their relationship comes to an end. Paul and Val had had a difficult relationship for some years after he had had an affair with one of Val's boyfriends. His childhood was difficult, often having to protect his mother and get her out of trouble. He later revealed to Diane that he had been subjected to frequent beatings by the man he thought was his father, along with his brothers. On the day of Jack and Diane's wedding, Val revealed that Paul's father was not Jimmy Pepper (Michael Gunn), a former boyfriend, as he had always been told but Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower), who at the time of Paul's conception was married to Val's sister and Paul's aunt, Diane. Rodney and Paul then try to build a relationship, with Rodney finding Paul's sexuality difficult to cope with. However, they do finally build a good relationship. Paul also becomes close friends with Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor). In his early days in the village, Paul does a drag act, called Thelma Louise, but later stops doing this. He works as a barman at \\"The Woolpack\\" pub and also as an event organiser. In 2005, Paul starts a relationship with bisexual Ivan Jones (Daniel Brocklebank), a local binman. Having suffered homophobic abuse in the past, Ivan does not want their relationship known, something which is difficult for Paul. They get past everyone finding out about their relationship by accident in the pub, but Paul's half-sister Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) develops a crush on Ivan. However, when Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) ‚Äì the mother of Nicola's partner Simon (Dale Meeks) ‚Äì sees Ivan and Nicola together she gets the wrong idea, and tells everyone that they are having an affair. Paul ends their relationship, and although Ivan tells him Nicola was lying, Paul refuses to give him another chance. In late 2006, Paul rescues Grayson Sinclair (Christopher Villiers) from a homophobic assault in a park in Hotten, and Grayson reveals he is bisexual. Grayson's wife, Perdita (Georgia Slowe), assumes that Paul and Grayson are having an affair, but Paul reassures her they are just friends, and he builds a strong friendship with Perdita. In February 2007, Perdita believes that Grayson is sleeping with Jonny Foster (Richard Grieve), so she introduces him to Paul to keep him away from Grayson. They soon start a relationship, and after six months Jonny moves in with Paul, Emily and Rodney. When Grayson and Perdita have difficulties in their relationship ‚Äì caused by his mother Rosemary (Linda Thorson) ‚Äì she is sectioned. Paul helps build their relationship and acts a go between the two when she refuses to see Grayson. Paul develops feelings for Grayson, and Jonny asks Paul to marry him. Paul accepts, but during their engagement he has a one-night stand with Grayson. When Grayson tells Paul it meant nothing to him, Paul feels guilty and tells Jonny. He manages to persuade Jonny not to leave Emmerdale and on 3 March 2008 they have their civil partnership at Hotten Registry Office. Later that day they have a ceremony at Home Farm, as neither can tell their parents they have already legally married. Grayson and Perdita separate, and after one argument he tells her about his one-night stand with Paul. Months later, Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) gives birth to Grayson and Perdita's child, who she had agreed to surrogate when they were still together. Katie had told Grayson that they would bring up the child together, without Perdita, but changes her mind when she finds out about Grayson's relationship with Paul. Katie had not told Perdita of her plans to give the child to her, so when Katie goes into labour Perdita tells Grayson. Perdita soon runs off with the baby, but Jonny refuses to believe that Paul had not tipped Grayson off. He later does believe Paul, but he later sees Paul and Grayson hug. Although, Paul said nothing had happened and he had not reciprocated the hug, Jonny said he could no longer trust Paul and leaves the village. Grayson leaves the next day after Paul outs him and tells the village about their one-night stand. Jonny soon texts asking for a divorce, and in January 2009, he requests they close their joint bank account. After this Paul's friends, Lily Butterfield (Anne Charleston) and Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi), seeing how upset he is decides to try and reconcile him and Jonny. This causes Jonny's mother, Patricia (Vicki Michelle), to visit the village. After initial confusion, Paul convinces Patricia that he still loves Jonny, who has moved home to Australia. He plans to travel to Australia to try and rebuild his relationship with Jonny, but Val lies and tells him that Rodney has a heart condition in attempt to ensure Paul does not leave the village. Lily, however, gets in touch with Jonny and arranges a meeting between him and Paul. While they both still love each other, Paul tells Jonny he cannot leave Emmerdale because of his father's condition. However, on the day Jonny is to fly out, Paul discovers Val had been lying about his Rodney's illness after confronting Rodney when he was about to make love to Pam Montclare (Catherine Rabett). Before he leaves, although he does not forgive Val for her lies, he does say he believes she is sorry for what she did. He then rushes to meet Jonny and they leave for Australia together. Paul returns briefly in June 2010 for Nicola's wedding to Jimmy King (Nick Miles). He goes back to Australia after the ceremony. Paul returns again in March 2015 after Val is hospitalised after collapsing, whilst suffering from HIV. Paul is shocked by his mother's condition and sits at her bedside whilst she is in a coma and begs her to recover. He is also introduced to Val's employee Finn Barton (Joe Gill). When a doctor tells Val's family to prepare for the worst, Paul is devastated. Val wakes from her coma and Paul is relieved that his mother is OK. Paul notices that Finn is attracted to one of the hospital nurses, Darren Thompson (Danny Horn). He then goes to the village and visits his half-sister and cousin Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) at her Beauty Salon and she shows him round her premises. He also is introduced to Val's other employee Tracy Shankley (Amy Walsh) when she asks Paul's stepfather Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) for a place to stay. Paul also visits Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Laurel Dingle (Charlotte Bellamy). He helps Laurel prepare for a job interview with Bernice and tells her that he would like to stay for longer but has things to sort out back home. Paul goes for drinks in the pub with Jimmy, Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) and Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and promises to keep in touch and asks for updates on Val's recovery. He also says goodbye to Bernice then leaves. Following Val's death in a helicopter crash, Paul returns to the village in September for his mother's funeral. He is comforted by Rodney and Bernice. Paul is shocked when a grieving Eric steals the hearse and drives off with Val's coffin still inside. He remarks that his mother would have found it funny. Paul also offers Alicia Metcalfe (Natalie Anderson) the chance to be his business partner and co-own his bar in Portugal. He breaks down in tears during the funeral service. After the funeral, Paul calls his sister Sharon (Victoria Hawkins), who had been unable to attend as she was looking after her young daughter, and tells her how the service went. The following day, before he leaves, Paul leads an intervention to the B&B; of Eric's family and friends in an attempt to help him come to terms with his grief, but he lashes out at them and accuses Paul of abandoning Val. Paul then says his goodbyes and leaves, returning home to Portugal. Reception On 3 March 2008, Paul and Jonny made British television history by becoming the first couple on a primetime soap opera to enter a civil partnership since the Civil Partnership Act 2004 came into force on 5 December 2005. Although radio soap The Archers and daytime soap Doctors had previously featured civil partnerships, Emmerdale was the first primetime soap opera to do so. Bose said he was proud Emmerdale was the first, and commented that soaps \\"have a great responsibility to show things as they change and be cutting edge\\".

The character and casting were announced in January 2004 when it was announced that producers were bringing \\"four new single 'hunks'\\" into the show, one of them being Carl. Lister made his first appearance on the show on 6 February 2004. Throughout the course of his story arc, Carl establishes a relationship with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) ‚Äì which contributes to his storylines that include the pair having a ill-fated wedding after Chas exposes Carl's affair with her best friend Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw). During his time on the show, Carl has accidentally caused the death of local postman Paul Marsden (Matthew Booth); killed his own father Tom (Ken Farrington) in the events surrounding the Who Killed Tom King? storyline, which he ultimately confessed to his brothers Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Matthew (Matt Healy) on the show's 500th village anniversary episode ‚Äì after the trio were acquitted for their father's murder; formed a romance with DCI Grace Barraclough (Glynis Barber), the policewoman investigating his father's murder, that culminated with her being killed in a hit and run ‚Äì just as she prepared to take Carl into custody after he admitted to killing his father; sparked a business conflict with Matthew that concluded with the latter's death, after Carl ruined Matthew's wedding to his business partner Anna De Souza (Emma Davies) by exposing his involvement behind the death of her father Donald (Michael Jayston); developed a feud with Chas' niece Debbie (Charley Webb) upon clashing with her parents, Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Charity (Emma Atkins), respectively; embarked on a failed marriage with Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver); and became archenemies with Debbie's ex-boyfriend Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) after discovering his affair with Chas and subsequently blackmailing the pair in repaying him the ¬£30,000 that Chas previously swindled from his bank account. After getting jilted by Chas on their wedding day at Christmas 2010, Carl became the show's main antagonist upon alienating himself from his family and friends ‚Äì which ultimately led to the character being killed-off in the show's 40th anniversary episode. This involved Carl fighting with Jimmy over their problematic brotherhood; spoiling Chas' wedding to her fiance Dan Spencer (Liam Fox); and then nearly raping her after she rejects his efforts to recoup their broken relationship, up to the point where he confesses to killing his father for her. The seduction ends with Chas hitting Carl on the head with a brick, though he survives and ends up exposing her affair with Cameron to Debbie ‚Äì shortly before Carl is then murdered by Cameron after the latter arrives in a failed attempt to stop him from destroying their lives. Casting and creation In January 2004, The Sun announced that Emmerdale would bring in \\"four new single 'hunks'\\" who are all brothers in an attempt to increase the sex appeal of the serial. They announced that the siblings would arrive in February with Tom Lister having been cast as Carl who would arrive first after securing a job in Tate Haulage. Character development=Characterisation Describing Carl, itv.com said: \\"Carl is a bit of a womanizer and a ladies' man. As one of the younger King brothers he's always had to fight for his place in the family. He's also commitment phobic, and despite apparently finding his perfect match in Chas, his eyes wandered onto Eve and he wrecked what could have been a beautiful relationship. Carl has a bad temper on him and has been responsible for two accidental deaths ‚Äì so he's not one to be crossed\\". Relationship with Chas Dingle Carl has an on and off relationship with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter). Carl and Chas end their relationship. Lister explained that Carl never stopped loving Chas but the relationship ended when \\"that door was basically slammed in his face when Chas's son Aaron fell into the mix and gave his mum an ultimatum ‚Äì him or Carl. So Chas chose her son\\". Pargeter explained that Chas could not reunite with Carl while Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) is around due to his ultimatum. Chas begins a relationship with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). Pargeter said that Chas loves Paddy as a friend and she could not \\"love anybody the way she loved ‚Äì or still loves ‚Äì Carl, really\\". She added that Chas has \\"never moved on because there was never closure\\" in the relationship. Carl begins a relationship with Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver). Lister said that Lexi proposes as she knows \\"there's something there between Carl and Chas and Lexi's envious of that. Obviously Lexi knows that Carl killed his father, but she doesn't know that Chas was the reason. Lexi decides to go all-guns blazing and propose. I think rather than being backed into a corner, part of Carl thinks that if Chas has knocked him back, he'll try and do right by Lexi\\". Lister told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Carl enters the relationship with the best intentions instead of \\"wishing he was with Chas all the time\\" who will always be in the \\"background\\". The actor said that viewers would be unsure whether Carl would go through with the wedding to Lexi or whether Carl would instead reunite with Chas. On his wedding day to Lexi, Carl tells Chas that he can not marry Lexi because he still loves her. Pargeter explained that \\"Chas is completely screwed up by the revelation\\" and is \\"desperate to get things back on track with Carl, but she's got Aaron to contend with. So Carl pours his heart out and she has to be as strong as she can\\". When Chas rejects Carl he marries Lexi but the marriage soon after ends when Carl admits he does not love Lexi. Carl reunites with Chas but becomes tempted reignite his affair with Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw). Lister explained that his character decides to be \\"sensible\\" by putting some distance between Eve and himself as he does not want to mess up again after his \\"distaster\\" of a marriage to Lexi. He added that Carl is \\"not tempted enough\\" to cheat on Chas as he believes she is \\"the love of his life and he's decided to stay faithful to her ‚Äì at least for now\\". Carl and Eve begin an affair; Chas discovers this. Pargeter revealed that Chas' initial reaction is to confront the pair but instead she decides to seek revenge as she is \\"very hurt\\". Chas begins her revenge by doing \\"little things\\" but later decides to \\"up her game and to start playing really dirty\\". Chas proposes to Carl as part of her plan, Pargeter said Chas \\"can't help wishing it was all for real\\". She added that it is important to Chas that Carl and Eve get their comeuppance. Pargeter said that Chas can not decide whether she will go through with her revenge or if she would instead forgive Carl and marry him. She added that Chas \\"geniunely thinks he loves her\\" and she loves him too. Chas lies she is pregnant. Lister said that Carl will be \\"gutted\\" if Chas goes through with her revenge plan. He explained that Carl was \\"thrilled\\" at Chas' pregnancy and he now wants to \\"give Chas whatever she wants ‚Äì a big Christmas day wedding, anything to make her happy\\". Carl \\"wants to become a proper family with Chas and the baby. He'll be devastated if it all comes crashing down\\". He \\"realises his fling with Eve was a massive mistake, based on excitement and lust\\". Lister added that Carl felt Chas' proposal and pregnancy were \\"a great excuse to get out of the affair with Eve because it was all getting a little bit complicated\\", explaining that Eve \\"was becoming too much hard work\\". Lister explained the couple's relationship saying: \\"there's something about those two ‚Äì they are an absolute nightmare when they are together because they either fall out or one of them does something that jeopardises the relationship. But they always keep coming together, back to one another. They are destined to be together\\". Chas plans to expose Carl's affair on their wedding day, Lister explained that Chas begins \\"losing confidence in the whole revenge plan because she realises how much she would actually love to marry him and would love to have a family with him\\". He added that Carl and Chas have always wanted to marry and begin a family but they have never been able to \\"get their act together and decide to do it\\". Lister told Ryan Love of Digital Spy that Chas begins to doubt whether she will go through with exposing Carl's affair after she sees how serious Carl is about their relationship and that he has ended his affair with Eve. Lister said that if Chas goes through with her plan then Carl will be in disbelief that Chas \\"could do something like this ‚Äì that she could pretend that she was pregnant, that she could do all this stuff basically just to bleed him dry of all the money. [...] For her to take him to the cleaners, I think he would be so gutted and completely ashamed for it to be revealed like that in front of everybody\\". Lister added that Carl could forgive Chas if she was honest about her plot before the wedding. Lister went on to say that Carl has \\"always seen Chas as the answer to all of his problems. She was like the one who he could get his life sorted with\\". Departure and death In October 2012, as part of the show's 40th anniversary celebrations, Carl was murdered by love rival Cameron Murray. His last words were \\"I'm indestructible.\\" His body was found the next morning. Storylines Carl was the first member of the King family to arrive in Emmerdale as the new driver for Tate Haulage. However, no one knows that he is a spy, reporting back to his family business, King & Sons. Carl learns what Tate Haulage plan to bid for a new contract and, with this information, his family revise their bid and win the contract. Despite being married, Carl flirts with Louise Appleton (Emily Symons) and she agrees to a date until Carl's wife, Colleen (Melanie Ash), arrives and tells Louise that she is Carl's wife and mother of his children; Thomas (Mark Flanagan) and Anya (Lauren Sheriston) before telling Carl not to come home. Louise slaps Carl and goes home so he moves into Holdgate Farm with his family but is \\"persuaded\\" to do some repairs to the roof, despite his fear of heights. Local postman, Paul Marsden (Matthew Booth) helps him and seeing his nerves about heights, starts teasing him and mucking about but stretches too far and falls, dying instantly. Not wanting people to know they were involved, Carl and his brothers, Jimmy (Nick Miles) and Matthew (Matt Healy), move his body to the back garden of the cottage Paul shared with his wife, Siobhan (Abigail Fisher). She finds him and assumes he fell from their roof after fixing the television aerial. Meanwhile, Carl bonds with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) over feeling like they're bad parents for abandoning their children and tells her about Paul's death. They start dating but the relationship is rocky and during one break, Carl has a one-night stand with Chloe Atkinson (Amy Nuttall). When she finds out Carl and Chas are back together, she decides to split them up permanently. She starts a campaign of poison pen letters and undermines Chas's trust in Carl, succeeding in her aim so he reconciles with Chloe but soon tires of her and tries to end it. Not wanting to let him go, she tells him she's pregnant, despite the fact that she isn't and starts trying to get pregnant before Carl discovers the truth. Chas discovers Chloe's lie and forces her to tell Carl the truth, that she isn't pregnant and never was. Before leaving the village, she reminds Carl that she could be pregnant as they weren't taking precautions. Horrified at his mistake, Carl tries to reconcile with Chas but she is not interested and leaves to join the army so Carl starts dating her cousin, Del Dingle (Hayley Tamaddon). Realising that Carl wanted Chas, not her, Del encourages him to fight for Chas so he tracks her down and declares his feelings, accidentally dropping her after picking her up and breaking her leg. Consequently, Chas is discharged on medical grounds and reconciles with Carl and he proposes marriage but Chas refuses, until he does a wing walk to conquer his vertigo. They move into Home Farm with his father Tom (Ken Farrington) and Chas becomes Jimmy's personal assistant. Tensions erupt when Matthew and Jimmy's ex-wife, Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), declare their feelings for each other, move into Victoria Cottage and start a rival company. Matthew uses Carl to pass Jimmy false information so he loses an important deal while Tom and his fianc√©e, Rosemary Sinclair (Linda Thorson), insist that Chas is not good enough for Carl and on learning that Chas has been giving information about the Kings to Jamie Hope (Alex Carter), whose sister died in the King's River Showhome disaster, Tom bullies and bribes Chas to end things with Carl. Chas, however, encouraged by her cousin, Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun), tells Carl the truth on Tom and Rosemary's wedding day. Later that day, Tom dies after falling from his bedroom window, and his sons are the primary suspects. The brothers are stunned to learn that they have a half-sister, Scarlett (Kelsey-Beth Crossley), daughter of their mother's nurse, Carrie Nicholls (Linda Lusardi). Carl struggles to bond with her and he and Matthew try to buy her share of the business. Carl eventually softens but is uncomfortable around Carrie, as they had a brief relationship when he was a teenager but is grateful when Carrie helps evict Rosemary from Home Farm. Hari Prasad (John Nayagam) tells the police that he heard the King brothers discussing how they murdered Tom and Louise, his girlfriend, backs him up but the case collapses when Louise admits giving a false statement. After the acquittal, Carl admits to Jimmy and Matthew that he killed Tom. He reveals that he confronted Tom about Chas, hitting him when Tom called Chas names and then pushed him away, causing Tom to fall out of the window. Carl begins dating DCI Grace Barraclough (Glynis Barber) in secret, unaware of her plan to learn who killed Tom, but Carl won't say. Grace ends their relationship and Carl gets drunk, telling Jimmy and Matthew about the relationship so Jimmy takes Carl abroad to clear his head. However, on his return, Carl deliberately gets arrested for drink driving so he can see Grace and tells her that he killed Tom and decides to confess. Jimmy watches as Carl and Grace go to the police station and as Carl stops to answer his phone, Grace carries on and is hit by a lorry. Grace dies and despite telling the police that he is a killer, the police ignore him as they are more concerned about Grace. Carrie's daughter, Lexi (Sally Oliver), visits her sister and becomes involved with Carl. He joins De Souza Enterprises, angering Matthew. Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston) appoints Carl MD of his business, disappointing his daughter, Anna (Emma Davies). Carl hires Lexi to be his PA, but discovers she has been passing information to Matthew, and ends things with her. Carl and Anna are attracted to each other and he is jealous of her relationship with Matthew and reconciles with Lexi, but when he tries to end their relationship, Lexi tells him that Carrie told her that he killed Tom. Donald buys Mill Cottage for Carl and he and Lexi move in together. However, on learning that Carl sent an important client to his brothers, Donald terminates Carl's contract and Carl returns to work with his brothers. Carl is saddened when he hears that Donald has died and Matthew admits causing his death by refusing to give him his heart medication. Knowing the guilt Matthew will live with, urges him to tell Anna but he refuses. When King & Sons is declared bankrupt and the bailiffs move in on Matthew and Anna's wedding day, Carl is furious to learn that De Souza Enterprises wrecked King & Sons's chances of survival and that Matthew will have an interest in the company as he is married to Anna, Carl blames Matthew for everything and reveals the truth about Donald's death at the wedding. This leads to a fight between him and Carl and Matthew drives a van at him. However, on seeing Anna standing with Carl, he swerves and is thrown through the windscreen, dying on the road. Carl realises his only assets are Mill Cottage and a mortgage he gave Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) and begins pressuring her for money. Carl, Jimmy, Lexi and Scarlett scrape together enough money to start a new haulage company. Carl tells Chas that he still loves her, but she insists they are history. Lexi proposes to Carl and he accepts, she sets a date but Carl goes missing on the day. He meets Chas and she insists she has moved on so he marries Lexi but is furious when he learns she has stopped taking precautions without consulting him. He reluctantly agrees to have a baby and Lexi gets pregnant but miscarries almost immediately as the pregnancy is ectopic. Tests done just after the miscarriage show that Lexi is unlikely to conceive again without IVF and Carl agrees to try IVF initially but soon changes his mind. Nicola De Souza (Nicola Wheeler) insists that Carl tell Lexi, which he does, and they argue. She also argues with Nicola and Nicola goes into premature labour after falling down the stairs. Lexi apologises and Nicola forgives her. Later, after a nurse gives baby Angelica to Lexi while Nicola is in the shower, she takes her up on to the roof, simply wanting to show her the world. However, seeing Lexi sitting on the roof with baby Angelica makes Jimmy, Nicola and Carl panic that she is going to jump. Carl talks her down and she returns baby Angelica to Nicola and Jimmy after Carl admits that he doesn't love Lexi and wouldn't have married her if she hadn't known that he killed Tom. Lexi tells Carl that she is leaving him and joins Carrie in Canada. Nicola insists Carl move out of Mill Cottage and he reconciles with Chas again after telling her partner, Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt), about their affair. They are happy together for a while but, now getting bored, Carl begins an affair with Eve Jenson (Suzanne Shaw). Chas proposes to him and implies she is pregnant. Carl accepts and gives her money for the wedding and ends things with Eve but on the day, Chas reveals Carl's affair with Eve to the village and humiliates him. Carl becomes bitter towards Chas for stealing his money and is accused of starting a fire near her house, which engulfs the village and kills Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) and Viv Hope (Deena Payne). Carl is arrested but later freed. He and Chas have a one-night stand months later and he comforts her when her son, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller), is charged with murder. Carl borrows money from Scarlett to hire a lawyer for Aaron but when Aaron refuses to take it, invests it in his business instead. Disgusted, Scarlett discovers what he has done and leaves the village. Carl is caught speeding on CCTV and he convinces Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) to take his speeding points for him, in exchange for a job. The police reveal that a cyclist was hit during the incident and Carl is shocked when he learns Rodney could go to prison. Rodney blackmails him into giving him money and a job. Jimmy discovers what is happening and confronts Carl. Carl discovers Chas has been having an affair with Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) and begins blackmailing them for the ¬£30,000 that Chas took from him. Carl slowly becomes obsessed with getting Chas back and starts pushing everyone away, including Jimmy. Carl asks Chas to run away with him and she agrees, wanting to keep him sweet. However, on her wedding day, Carl has a fight with Jimmy. However, after she marries Dan Spencer (Liam Fox), Carl realises that she has no intention of being with him. He corners Chas and confesses that he killed his father for her. Chas is disgusted and tries to flee. However, he pushes her down and attempts to rape her. In self-defence, Chas hits him over the head with a brick. She flees the scene. Later, Cameron turns up. They argue and Cameron hits Carl with a brick, killing him. His last words were \\"I'm indestructible.\\" His body is found the following morning. Chas is put on trial for Carl's murder, but is found not guilty. Cameron is eventually found out and put in prison, before his death. Reception At the 2007 Inside Soap Awards Lister was nominated for the \\"Sexiest Male\\" award for his portrayal of Carl. The same year, at the British Soap Awards, the \\"Who killed Tom King?\\" storyline was nominated for \\"Best Storyline\\". At the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards Lister was nominated in the \\"Most Popular Actor\\" category. He was later nominated in the \\"Sexiest Male\\" category at the British Soap Awards in 2009. In 2012, Lister was nominated for the \\"Best Bad Boy\\" Award at the Inside Soap Awards and for \\"Villain of the Year\\" at the British Soap Awards. and the awards has praised Lister's character Carl, as one of the all-time great, completely horrific soap monsters. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Lister was nominated for \\"Best Male Soap Actor\\" and came fifth with 7.0% of the vote. The Guardian's Grace Dent commented that \\"Carl King is powerless when presented with sexy golddiggers like Eve. Carl absolutely cannot and will not stop marrying these awful women until he's living in the back of a Land Rover heating up Heinz London Grill with a lighter his wife's lawyer owns half of. A fool and his underpants are easily parted.\\" Carl's death episode boosted the serial's viewing figures and helped secure the highest viewing figures of the year. Regarding Carl's exit, David Brown of Radio Times stated that the episode \\"Tom Lister, who's played Carl since 2004, gave a barnstorming valedictory performance: in a show once described by Les Dawson as \\"Dallas with dung\\", he really was a bucolic J. R. Ewing [...] But as Carl lay lifeless on the floor in those dying seconds, it really did feel like the end of an era. Ironically Carl ended up dead by his son that he craved, just as he laid waste to his own father during that classic Christmas episode. New babies ‚Äì even when they have prophetic names like Jack Sugden ‚Äì are ten-a-penny on soaps. But decent villains are priceless: at the moment, it‚Äôs hard to see who deserves to inherit the mighty Carl King‚Äôs crown\\".

The term was later used in the context of counter insurgency operations coordinated by Colonel James Steele, a retired special forces veteran who was nominated by Donald Rumsfeld to help organise Shi'ite paramilitaries in an attempt to quell a Sunni insurgency during the Iraq War. From 1984 to 1986 Steele operated as a counterinsurgency specialist and was head of the United States Military Group of US special forces advisers to frontline battalions of the Salvadorean military (which developed a reputation for its death squad activities). The use of such methods in Iraq was controversial and attracted debate in the Pentagon and among members of the Iraqi government. It raised the question of possible U.S. military involvement in the use of quasi-official death squads, a tactic that was allegedly instrumental in bringing a decade-long war against the Salvadorian Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN) to a close. As the insurgency intensified, the US Military turned to Israel for lessons in military occupation. Israeli officers trained American troops in urban warfare techniques based on their experience in the West Bank and Gaza. An article published in the Guardian quoted senior a US intelligence official who confirmed Israeli involvement and the setting up of assassination teams. An article published by Newsweek in January 2005 that explored the notion of the \\"Salvador Option\\" quoted anonymous military insiders but did not specify the precise origin of the phrase or explicitly say that those words were actually used by Pentagon sources.. According to Newsweek: > ...one Pentagon proposal would send Special Forces teams to advise, support > and possibly train Iraqi squads, most likely hand-picked Kurdish Peshmerga > fighters and Shiite militiamen, to target Sunni insurgents and their > sympathizers, even across the border into Syria, according to military > insiders familiar with the discussions. It remains unclear, however, whether > this would be a policy of assassination or so-called \\"snatch\\" operations, in > which the targets are sent to secret facilities for interrogation. The > current thinking is that while U.S. Special Forces would lead operations in, > say, Syria, activities inside Iraq itself would be carried out by Iraqi > paramilitaries. Former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld has publicly denounced the Newsweek article as \\"nonsense\\", when directly asked if such a policy was under consideration, he answered \\"Why would I even talk about something like that?\\" Observers of the Iraqi conflict have taken these and other cues to argue that the \\"Salvador Option\\" was put into operation. They point in particular to the existence of a Shi'ite led unit affiliated with the Iraqi ministry known as the Wolf Brigade.

He was the senior disciple of Wu Chien-ch'uan, the founder of Wu-style taijiquan, and married Wu's daughter Wu Ying-hua in 1930. Biography Ma Yueliang was also a medical doctor who graduated from the Beijing Medical College in 1929 and specialized in Hematology. He established the First Medical Examination and Experiment Office and ran the blood clinics at Zhong Shan Hospital in Shanghai. Like Wu Ch'uan-yu and Wu Chien-ch'uan, Ma was of Manchu descent. Ma was educated both in the traditions of China and in Western science. There are accounts that Ma was a gifted martial artist in his youth. He had studied a number of martial arts including, Shaolinquan, Three Emperors Pao Chui, Baguazhang and Tongbeiquan. However, Wu Jianquan would accept Ma as a student only if he concentrated on Wu-style taijiquan. From about age 18, Ma exclusively studied Wu-style taijiquan. Wu Jianquan started the Jianquan Taijiquan Association (ÈëëÊ≥âÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥Á§æ) in Shanghai in 1936, and Ma became the deputy director of the Association. Ma studied Taijiquan with Wu Chien-ch'uan until the death of his teacher in 1942. The Jianquan Association still exists today internationally and remains a resource for the study of Wu-style taijiquan. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Ma Yueliang and his wife in the emergence of Wu-style taijiquan after the Cultural Revolution in China. Even at an advanced age, Ma was chosen as one of the 100 Best Martial Artists in China. Wu Ying-hua and Ma continued to teach in Taijiquan until their deaths. They taught a large number of students in Shanghai and in their travels to New Zealand, Germany and elsewhere. They published several books on Wu-style taijiquan. Ma and Wu Ying- hua's Wu style sword/weapons book includes a family picture with several of their closest students. Ma Yueliang also publicly practiced a number of formerly closed door (private or family secret) forms and methods so that they would not be lost. In public, Wu Ying-hua would often demonstrate the Wu style Slow Set and Ma would follow by demonstrating the Wu Style Tai Chi Fast Form. Ma taught many high level students, including Xie Bing Canhttps://bellevuetaichi.wordpress.com/, and Fei Gua-ching who is still active in the Jianquan Taijiquan Association in Shanghai. Li Li-Qun is one of Grandmaster Ma's oldest and closest living students. He was the deputy vice- secretary of the Jianquan Association (Chien Chuan Association) in Shanghai under masters Ma and his wife Wu Ying Hua. Ma Yueliang and Wu Ying-hua are survived by their children and grandchildren, including: Ma Jiangchun (b. 1931), Dr. Ma Hailong (b. 1935), Ma Jiang Bao (b. 1941, d. 2016) and Ma Jiangling (b. 1947). Ma Jiang Bao lived in the Netherlands and taught traditional Taijiquan throughout Europe. Their adopted daughter Shi Mei Lin now lives and teaches Wu-style taijiquan in New Zealand. She also has students in France and in the United States (Tucson, Arizona). Bibliography *Wu Kung-tsao.

Law Commission of India in its 41st report recommended to incorporate this provision in procedure code.AIR 1980 SC 1632 This provision allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of an arrest on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence. On filing anticipatory bail, the opposing party is notified about the bail application and the opposition can then contest the bail application in court (public prosecutor can also be used to do this). Anticipatory bail is a direction to release a person on bail, issued even before the person is arrested. It is only issued by the Sessions Court and High Court. Eligibility When any person apprehends that there is a move to get him arrested on false or trumped-up charges, or due to enmity with someone, or he fears that a false case is likely to be built up against him, he has the right to move the court of Session or the High Court under section 438(1) of the code of Criminal Procedure for grant of bail in the event of his arrest for a cognizable or non-cognizable offence, and the court may if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail. Anticipatory bail can be granted by [Sessions Court] and High Court. Conditions The High Court or the court of session may include such conditions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including: * a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by the police officer as and when required; * a condition that the person shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer; * a condition that the person shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court. If such person is thereafter arrested, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail, he shall be released on bail and the magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that warrant should be issued against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of the court granting anticipatory bail. Supreme Court while dealing the case of Sidhram Mhetre, held certain conditions imposed by High Court to be not required & contrary to provisions of anticipatory bail.(2011)1 SCC 694 Qualification The applicant must show by disclosing special facts and events that he or she has reason to believe, that he or she may be arrested for a non-bailable offence so that the court may take care to specify the offence or offences in respect of which alone the order will be effective and it is not a blanket order covering all other offences. Cancellation An accused is free on bail as long as the same is not cancelled. The High Court or Court of Session may direct that any person who has been released on bail be arrested and commit him to custody on an application moved by the complainant or the prosecution.

A year later, Ms. Picasso presented her first efforts to her friend, famed couturier Yves Saint Laurent, who immediately commissioned her to design accessories to accompany one of his collections. By 1971, she was working for the Greek jewelry company Zolotas. In 1980 Picasso began designing jewelry for Tiffany & Co. of New York. In 1984 she began experimenting with fragrance, creating the \\"Paloma\\" perfume for L'Or√©al.Fashion Encyclopedia. 13 November 2008. In the New York Post Picasso described it as intended for \\"strong women like herself.\\" A cosmetics and bath line including body lotion, powder, shower gel, and soap were produced in the same year. Two American museums have acquired Ms. Picasso's work for their permanent collections. Housed in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History is a 396.30-carat kunzite necklace designed by her. And visitors to The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago can view her 408.63-carat moonstone bracelet accented with diamond \\"lightning bolts.\\" In 1988, Ms. Picasso was honored by The Fashion Group as one of the \\"Women Who Have Made an Extraordinary Impact on Our Industry.\\" The Hispanic Designers Inc. presented her with its MODA award for design excellence. Since 1983, she has been a member of the International Best Dressed List. In 2010, Picasso celebrated her 30th anniversary with Tiffany and Co. by introducing a collection based upon her love of Morocco, called Marrakesh. In 2011, she debuted her Venezia collection, which celebrates the city of Venice and its motifs. Red Picasso has a penchant for red; her red lipsticks were called \\"her calling cards\\". Fran√ßois Nars says about Paloma, \\"red is her trademark.\\" \\"It's her signature, defining, one might say, the designer's red period.\\" Her fascination with red started at an early age, when she began wearing bright red lipstick at age 6. She has become recognizable by her red lipstick; \\"Her angular profile serves as a reminder of her father's Cubist inclinations.\\" When she feels like staying incognito, she simply avoids wearing her red lipstick: \\"Red lips have become my signature, so when I don‚Äôt want to be recognized, I don‚Äôt wear it.\\" Film Picasso briefly lost interest in designing following the death of her father in 1973, at which time she played Countess Erzs√©bet B√°thory in Polish filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk's erotic film, Immoral Tales (1973), receiving praise from the critics for her beauty. She has not acted since. Personal life In 1978, Picasso married playwright and director Rafael Lopez-Cambil (also known as Rafael Lopez- Sanchez) in a black-and-white themed wedding. The couple later divorced. In 1999, Picasso married Dr. Eric Th√©venet, a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.Thomas, Dana, A Fashionable Life: Paloma Picasso Harper's Bazaar, 9 February 2010 Th√©venet's interest in art and design has provided valuable insight toward the creation of Picasso's jewelry collections.

In compiler theory, the technique used to discover data dependencies among statements (or instructions) is called dependence analysis. There are three types of dependencies: data, name, and control.  Data dependencies  Assuming statement S_1 and S_2, S_2 depends on S_1 if: [I(S_1) \\\\cap O(S_2)] \\\\cup [O(S_1) \\\\cap I(S_2)] \\\\cup [O(S_1) \\\\cap O(S_2)] eq \\\\varnothing where: * I(S_i) is the set of memory locations read by S_i and * O(S_j) is the set of memory locations written by S_j * and there is a feasible run-time execution path from S_1 to S_2 This Condition is called Bernstein Condition, named by A. J. Bernstein. Three cases exist: * Anti-dependence: I(S_1) \\\\cap O(S_2) eq \\\\varnothing, S_1 \\\\rightarrow S_2 and S_1 reads something before S_2 overwrites it * Flow (data) dependence: O(S_1) \\\\cap I(S_2) eq \\\\varnothing, S_1 \\\\rightarrow S_2 and S_1 writes before something read by S_2 * Output dependence: O(S_1) \\\\cap O(S_2) eq \\\\varnothing, S_1 \\\\rightarrow S_2 and both write the same memory location.  Flow dependency (True dependency)  A Flow dependency, also known as a data dependency or true dependency or read- after-write (RAW), occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction: 1\\\\. A = 3 2\\\\. B = A 3\\\\. C = B Instruction 3 is truly dependent on instruction 2, as the final value of C depends on the instruction updating B. Instruction 2 is truly dependent on instruction 1, as the final value of B depends on the instruction updating A. Since instruction 3 is truly dependent upon instruction 2 and instruction 2 is truly dependent on instruction 1, instruction 3 is also truly dependent on instruction 1. Instruction level parallelism is therefore not an option in this example.  Anti-dependency  An anti-dependency, also known as write-after-read (WAR), occurs when an instruction requires a value that is later updated. In the following example, instruction 2 anti-depends on instruction 3 ‚Äî the ordering of these instructions cannot be changed, nor can they be executed in parallel (possibly changing the instruction ordering), as this would affect the final value of A. 1\\\\. B = 3 2\\\\. A = B + 1 3\\\\. B = 7 An anti-dependency is an example of a name dependency. That is, renaming of variables could remove the dependency, as in the next example: 1\\\\. B = 3 N. B2 = B 2\\\\. A = B2 + 1 3\\\\. B = 7 A new variable, B2, has been declared as a copy of B in a new instruction, instruction N. The anti-dependency between 2 and 3 has been removed, meaning that these instructions may now be executed in parallel. However, the modification has introduced a new dependency: instruction 2 is now truly dependent on instruction N, which is truly dependent upon instruction 1. As flow dependencies, these new dependencies are impossible to safely remove.  Output dependency  An output dependency, also known as write-after- write (WAW), occurs when the ordering of instructions will affect the final output value of a variable. In the example below, there is an output dependency between instructions 3 and 1 ‚Äî changing the ordering of instructions in this example will change the final value of A, thus these instructions cannot be executed in parallel. 1\\\\. B = 3 2\\\\. A = B + 1 3\\\\. B = 7 As with anti-dependencies, output dependencies are name dependencies. That is, they may be removed through renaming of variables, as in the below modification of the above example: 1\\\\. B2 = 3 2\\\\. A = B2 + 1 3\\\\. B = 7 A commonly used naming convention for data dependencies is the following: Read- after-Write or RAW (flow dependency), Write-After-Read or WAR (anti- dependency), or Write-after-Write or WAW (output dependency). Control Dependency An instruction B has a control dependency on a preceding instruction A if the outcome of A determines whether B should be executed or not. In the following example, the instruction S_2 has a control dependency on instruction S_1. However, S_3 does not depend on S_1 because S_3 is always executed irrespective of the outcome of S_1. S1. if (a  b) S2. a = a + b S3. b = a + b Intuitively, there is control dependence between two statements A and B if * B could be possibly executed after A * The outcome of the execution of A will determine whether B will be executed or not. A typical example is that there are control dependences between the condition part of an if statement and the statements in its true/false bodies. A formal definition of control dependence can be presented as follows: A statement S_2 is said to be control dependent on another statement S_1 iff * there exists a path P from S_1 to S_2 such that every statement S_i ‚â† S_1 within P will be followed by S_2 in each possible path to the end of the program and * S_1 will not necessarily be followed by S_2, i.e. there is an execution path from S_1 to the end of the program that does not go through S_2. Expressed with the help of (post-)dominance the two conditions are equivalent to * S_2 post-dominates all S_i * S_2 does not post-dominate S_1  Construction of Control Dependences  Control dependences are essentially the dominance frontier in the reverse graph of the control flow graph (CFG). Thus, one way of constructing them, would be to construct the post-dominance frontier of the CFG, and then reversing it to obtain a control dependence graph. The following is a pseudo-code for constructing the post-dominance frontier: for each X in a bottom-up traversal of the dominator tree do: PostDominanceFrontier(X) ‚Üê ‚àÖ for each Y ‚àà Predecessors(X) do: if immediatePostDominator(Y) ‚â† X: then PostDominanceFrontier(X) ‚Üê PostDominanceFrontier(X) ‚à™ {Y} done for each Z ‚àà Children(X) do: for each Y ‚àà PostDominanceFrontier(Z) do: if immediatePostDominator(Y) ‚â† X: then PostDominanceFrontier(X) ‚Üê PostDominanceFrontier(X) ‚à™ {Y} done done done Here, Children(X) is the set of nodes in the CFG that are post-dominated by X, and Predecessors(X) are the set of nodes in the CFG that directly precede X in the CFG. Once the post- dominance frontier map is computed, reversing it will result in a map from the nodes in the CFG to the nodes that have a control dependence on them. Implications Conventional programs are written assuming the sequential execution model. Under this model, instructions execute one after the other, atomically (i.e., at any given point in time, only one instruction is executed) and in the order specified by the program. However, dependencies among statements or instructions may hinder parallelism ‚Äî parallel execution of multiple instructions, either by a parallelizing compiler or by a processor exploiting instruction-level parallelism. Recklessly executing multiple instructions without considering related dependences may cause danger of getting wrong results, namely hazards.

Hovagimyan is an experimental cross media, new media and performance artist who lives and works in New York City.  Life  Hovagimyan was born 1950 in Plymouth, Massachusetts. In 1972, he received a B.F.A. from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and received an M.A. from New York University in 2005. He was a professor at the School of Visual Arts in the MFA Computer Arts Department. He was one of the first artists in New York to start working in Internet Art in 1993 with such artists' online groups as the thing, ArtNetWeb, and Rhizome. New York City Artistic practice  Hovagimyan has been working in a variety of forms since the 70s. An internet and new media pioneer, his works range from hypertext pieces to digital performance art, interactive installations and HD video. His works have been exhibited at MoMA, Mass MoCA, The Whitney Museum, The New Museum, The Walker Art Center, Jeu De Paume, MAC Marseille, MAC Lyon, Pompidou Center, Lincoln Center, ICA The Clocktower, The Kitchen, The Alternative Museum, Eyebeam Art & Technology, List Visual Arts Center, La Gaite Du Lyrique, Stuttgart Kunstverein, Steim Institute, the Moscow Center for Contemporary Art, Postmasters Gallery, Pace Digital Gallery. His works are in the collections of The Walker Art Center, The Whitney Museum, The Alternative Museum, Computer Fine Arts Collection and Perpetual Art Machine. Hovagimyan's work often provides a somewhat humorous, yet seriously rebellious and innovative approach to social media, its constructs, and the division between the physical and digital self. The use of technology as the primary medium for his work questions all of these elements simultaneously. Viewers sometimes use their physical bodies to change the virtual. For example, in works such as Post Browser (see below) they use their own interactions to recreate the websites of a famous art institution. These works examine new ways of interpreting websites, interactive technology, and our ideas about how all of these cultural aspects affect our lives on a daily basis. He has collaborated with English/French sound artist Peter Sinclair on a number of works and was an active member of the artist's group Colab. Early works=112 Workshop right From 1973 to 1986 he was involved in the SoHo and Lower East Side underground art scene. His first solo exhibition, a rigorously conceptual art show at 112 Workshop in 1973, was titled Control Designators. :\\"...Hovagimyan made use of three types of designators to direct the viewers experience of the space at 112: 100 number codes indicating the surface topologies of the space, three visual sighting devices functioning like a gun- sight to locate 100 points in the space, and 100 language signs giving directions for the ways to think about the space and move around within the space. The system was based on Jean Piaget's theory of child development as opposed to adult intellectual development. Thus, the basic matrix of the artist's code was related to the progression from undifferentiated surface topology through geometric triangulation to the linear sense of language experienced in reading.\\"Brentano, Robyn and Mark Savitt, eds. 112 Workshop/ 112 Greene Street History, Artists & ArtworksNew York University Press, New York. 1981 He has worked with artist Gordon Matta-Clark on several projects, namely: Days' End, Conical Intersect, Walking Man's Arch, and Underground Explorations. In 1974 during the video-performance series at 112 Greene Street, he performed opposite Spaulding Gray in Richard Serra's video A Prisoner's Dilemma. East Village, Punk, the Public, and Working with the Internet Much of Hovagimyan's early work was ephemeral in nature. It involved performance art, written and language works, and temporary installations in galleries. A word piece, Tactics for Survival in the New Culture, was exhibited in \\"The Manifesto Show\\" (1979) organized by the artist collective Colab. This particular piece was to become the basis for one of his first online hypertext works in 1993. He showed in several group exhibitions organized by Jean Dupuy, a French Fluxus artist living in New York at 405 E. 13th Street.(1980) Collective Consciousness, Arts Performances in the Seventies, Publications NYC, New York. In 1980 Hovagimyan did a series of punk performance pieces for Artist's Space series called Open Mic. One piece, Rich Sucker Rap was recorded by Davidson Gigliotti for a video tape called Chant a Capella which Electronic Arts Intermix carries in its catalog. He also performed in several No Wave Cinema films among them, The Offenders (1980) by Scott B and Beth B and The Deadly Art of Survival by Charles Ahearn. Selected Individual Works, '70s to early 2000s: \\"Tactics for Surviving in the New Culture\\", original 1974, hypertext web version, 1995. http://www.thing.net/~gh/artdirect/tactics.html This web art piece was a commentary on hyperlinks and their circular nature in reference to culture. The user linked onto one hyperlink, which followed another, which eventually led them back to an unexpected conceptual \\"link\\" on the homepage. For example, if the viewer clicked on \\"kill\\" on the home page, it would lead her to a page about America, the 10 Commandments, and how to be \\"Happy\\". If you clicked on these links, then it would lead you other pages from the home page about American culture, politics, and social \\"norms\\", eventually leading you back to the home page. One of the basic ideas was questioning where the boundary between technology and those who controlled it informed ideas and norms at the time.http://www.thing.net/~gh/artdirect/ ‚ÄúTerrorist Advertising‚Äù Billboard at Bowery & 5th Street, New York, 1993 a special billboard project, on view from September 23, 1993 to February 23, 1994. Northeast corner of Bowery and 5th Street in New York City. The artist has this to say about the work: \\"I view most advertising as an effort to manipulate peoples' opinions and desires. Advertising designed solely to increase the profits of a corporation at the expense of the individuals sense of self is just as terrible as a gun held to the head of a terrorist victim.\\" http://nujus.net/~nujus/gh_04/terror/index.html \\"BKPC (Barbie and Ken Politically Correct)\\", 1993, is a series of photo vignettes. The photos were originally offered on the thing bbs for download in 1993. When the internet became popular in 1994 the piece was reworked as a primitive HTML client pull animation. The piece also has been exhibited in physical form as a photo series. The work created a minor uproar when Mattel inc. sent a letter to the thing accusing it of copyright dilution and demanding that the work be removed immediately. The work focuses on interracial sex and white supremacy. It presents the point of view of a little girl playing with dolls and fantasizing about sex. http://nujus.net/~nujus/gh_04/gallery6.html \\"Hey Bozo, Use Mass Transit\\" 1995‚Äì1999 20 large scale billboards were commissioned by the New York City MTA as a yearly anti-pollution campaign.

The work carries on from earlier net.art works that challenge the web browser and the idea of framing and layout. The work also challenges the corporatization of the internet. I wrote an html parser to get around the MoMA‚Äôs web page layout and grab the current exhibitions images. These are made public on the internet. I wanted to lay them out in my own design. This questions the browser and web page metaphor in general. It‚Äôs a hangover from print media and it‚Äôs the importing of a static media form into a dynamic information space. I chose to allow the viewer to immerse themselves in the information space and interact with the information through their body movement and eyes. The viewer also hears the RSS feed from an art blog Hyperallergic being read by a synthetic voice. I laid out a live weather feed in the form of a text circle that forms a ring outside of the ring of images produce from MoMA. The Kinect camera‚Äôs infrared video is mapped onto the cylinder in the center putting the viewer in the work. Sofy Yuditskaya collaborated with me on the code to bring this work to fruition. She took my basic code and refined it and added her own touches. That‚Äôs the thing about writing code, you often get stuck and need someone to suggest a different approach or to help finish the project. This work is called Post Browser and is an alternative approach to information access. http://nujus.net/~nujus/gh_04/gallery23.html ReferencesExternal links *G.H.

On November 22, 2012, the court heard oral argument from the parties on the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court has not issued a ruling on the motion to dismiss. No trial date has been set. The viability of the case may be substantially affected by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Haliburton v. Erica P. John Fund which the Supreme Court is expected to rule on later this summer. December 2013: Plaintiffs dismiss lawsuit against Life Partners‚Äîclass certification denied Life Partners Holdings, Inc. announced on December 4, 2013, that the plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed a lawsuit filed against the company as well as its operating subsidiary, Life Partners, Inc., and two corporate officers. The abandonment of the lawsuit comes after the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas denied a motion for class certification in the lawsuit. Life Partners, Inc. is a life settlement provider and provides purchasing agent services for life settlement transactions. A life settlement is an alternative investment involving the purchase of an existing life insurance policy at a discount to its face value. While the plaintiffs in the case could have appealed the denial of the class action or continued to pursue the case as individuals, they elected instead to voluntarily dismiss the case against the Life Partners defendants. A key allegation was that Life Partners' medical consultant used an unreasonable method of estimating life expectancies. However, this allegation was criticized by the Court as part of its 34-page order denying certification as a class action: > Proof only of results does not address these factors. Nor could an after- > the-fact analysis of the insureds' deaths, in the aggregate, establish that > LPI was unreasonable in using Dr. Cassidy when and how it did. The Court is > highly skeptical that an analysis of results alone could lead a reasonable > juror to determine that Dr. Cassidy's methods were flawed. Life Partners CEO Brian Pardo commented, \\"This is yet another example of attorney-driven litigation which damages the entire economy, not to mention the companies that are the targets of such litigation. We are very pleased that the plaintiffs decided to walk away from this case and we hope to see other similar cases end the same way.\\" The case is styled Sean Turnbow et al. v. Life Partners, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:11-CV-1030-M, United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division.A copy of the court documents dismissing the case and the general release by plaintiffs may be viewed at http://www.lphi.com/doc/Release_20131203.pdf . March 2014: Life Partners cleared of all fraud claims Life Partners Holdings, Inc. announced in March 2014 that an Austin Federal court has ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to prove any of its fraud claims against Life Partners and its CEO, Brian Pardo, and General Counsel, Scott Peden. The ruling followed a jury finding in February that neither Life Partners, Mr. Pardo nor Mr. Peden committed securities fraud under Rule 10b-5 and that Mr. Pardo and Mr. Peden did not engage in insider trading. In the earlier ruling, the jury had found in favor of the SEC's fraud claim under Section 17(a) relating to the company's revenue recognition policies. That claim, which a government attorney characterized as \\"a lead\\" claim in the case, was challenged by Life Partners on the basis that it was not supported by any evidence. The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division agreed with Life Partners that there was no evidence to support the revenue recognition claims for the period of time in question and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of Life Partners, Mr. Pardo and Mr. Peden on that issue. As a result of this ruling, the Company, Mr. Pardo and Mr. Peden have been completely exonerated from any allegations of fraud alleged by the SEC. The Court let stand the jury's findings against Life Partners relating to bookkeeping, reporting and certification by the CEO of the company's financial statements, none of which involve fraud or knowingly or recklessly misleading shareholders. The case is SEC v. Life Partners Holdings, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 1-12-C V-33-JRN in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division.\\"SEC vs. Life Partners Holdings Inc., et al.\\" Retrieved on March 24, 2014 from https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/12/usa-sec-lifepartners- idUSL2N0M92D920140312 April 2014: Life Partners sues Charles Schwab subsidiary for counterfeiting On April 15, 2014, Life Partners Holdings, Inc. filed suit against optionsXpress, Inc., a subsidiary of The Charles Schwab Corporation, the company's chief financial officer, and one of the company's largest customers for issuing and selling counterfeit shares of Life Partners Holdings stock.(1) The lawsuit is entitled Life Partners Holdings, Inc. et al. v. optionsXpress, Inc., Jonathan I. Feldman and Thomas E. Stern, Case No. 14CH6428, Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, County Department, Chancery Division. A complete copy of the complaint is available at: http://www.lphi.com/doc/Release_20140415.pdf The lawsuit, filed in Illinois by California attorney Gary Aguirre, whose practice focuses on market manipulation, asks the Court for an order preventing the Schwab subsidiary from creating and selling shares of Life Partners Holdings' stock which were not authorized by the company. The action also asks the Court for protection from securities fraud, deceptive business practices and civil conspiracy arising from the unlawful issuance of the counterfeit shares. Under the law of Illinois, Texas, and every other state, a company has the exclusive right to issue and sell its own stock. The creation and sale of counterfeit or \\"phantom\\" stock by brokers and their customers violate these laws. The lawsuit is based on findings in an administrative proceeding by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against optionsXpress and the other defendants which concluded that optionsXpress, its chief financial officer, and one of its biggest customers committed securities fraud by engaging in the sales of hundreds of millions of dollars in counterfeit-phantom stock passed off as the genuine stock of 25 public companies, including almost $5.5 million of counterfeit-phantom stock of Life Partners Holdings, Inc.(2) The SEC decision, In the Matter of optionsXpress, Inc., et al. is available on the SEC web site at https://www.sec.gov/alj/aljdec/2013/id490bpm.pdf. The company is continuing to investigate other persons and entities who may have engaged in counterfeiting shares of Life Partners Holdings, Inc. December 2014: LPHI loses lawsuit with the SEC. LPHI, Pardo and Peden ordered to pay a total of $46.9 million in penalties A federal judge ordered Life Partners Holdings Inc and two top executives to pay $46.9 million for misleading investors about the core aspects of its business. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Life Partners in 2012 and sought to prove that Life Partners intentionally misled investors over nearly four years about core aspects of its \\"life-settlements\\" business and that its two top executives engaged in insider trading. U.S. District Court Judge James Nowlin on Tuesday ordered Life Partners to pay $15 million in illegal profit and $23.7 million in civil penalties. Chief Executive Brian Pardo was ordered to pay a $6.2 million civil penalty, while general counsel and secretary of LPHI, R. Scott Peden, was given a $2 million civil penalty. Judge Nowlin reversed a jury finding in March that Life Partners and its executives were liable on one count of fraud. \\"In ordering this significant monetary relief, the court recognized the egregious nature of their misconduct, noting that the defendants engaged in 'serious violations' of the securities laws, that they 'deprived the investing public of the information it needed to make a fully informed decision about whether to invest in Life Partners,\\" said Andrew Ceresney, SEC's enforcement director. December 2016: Life Partners Inc. exits bankruptcy On December 9, 2016, a Joint Plan of Reorganization sponsored by H. Thomas Moran, II the Chapter 11 trustee, and the Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee became effective. Life Partners emerged from bankruptcy, reorganized to maximize the recovery of investors' funds. Moran was quoted as saying: > Within the next two weeks, distributions of more than $100 million collected > from matured policies during the bankruptcy proceedings will be distributed > to investors. Going forward, we project that investors will receive roughly > 90 percent of their invested capital over time as a result of the plan we > were able to put in place‚Äîdepending on the option they elected.

Melissa Etheridge contributed three songs to the film. In the film, the adventures of bear brothers Kenai and Koda continue. While the first film dealt with Kenai's relationship with Koda, this one focuses more on his bond with a young human of his past, Nita. Only five of the original characters return for the sequel (excluding Denahi): Kenai, Koda, Rutt, Tuke, and Tug, as Jason Raize died on February 3, 2004. Only four of those actors came back to do their original roles: Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, and Michael Clarke Duncan. Producer Jim Ballantine was removed from the project and replaced with Carolyn Bates. Jason Marsden, as heard in the first trailer, was originally announced to voice Kenai, after being voiced by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film; Patrick Dempsey ultimately voiced the character. However, the end credits still note Marsden as one of the additional voices.'Brother Bear' DVD Press Release\\". Walt Disney Home Entertainment. May 26, 2006. Retrieved May 27, 2006  Plot  Picking up several months after the events of the first film, Kenai, now a bear, is living joyfully with his foster brother Koda. Having just awoken from hibernation, the bears begin traveling to Crowberry Ridge for the first berries of the season. However, Kenai is plagued by visions of his childhood friend Nita, to whom he gave a special amulet many years ago after saving her from drowning. Nita, now grown up, is set to wed Atka, a man from a neighboring Inuit village. However, on the day of the wedding, the Spirits appear in the form of a storm that causes a fissure to open up in the ground between Nita and Atka, much to Nita's shock. Believing it to be a sign, Nita consults Innoko, the wisest shaman of the tribes. By communicating with the Spirits, Innoko reveals that the amulet that Kenai gave Nita all those years ago bonded her and Kenai together. The only way for Nita to sever the bond and be able to marry Atka is to find Kenai, go with him to Hokani Falls where he had given her the amulet, and burn the amulet together on the eve of the Equinox, thus returning the bond to the Spirits. Innoko grants Nita the ability to communicate with Kenai and the other wildlife. Eventually, Kenai and Koda meet up with Nita. At first, Kenai refuses to destroy the bond, but Nita tells him that the Spirits may turn him back into a human and send him to find her. Under pressure from Nita and Koda, who fears that he and Kenai could no longer be brothers if this happens, Kenai relents and the three make their way to Hokani Falls. As they spend more time together, Kenai and Nita rekindle their old friendship, much to Koda's chagrin. The three also run into Rutt and Tuke multiple times throughout their journey, and Nita helps them woo a pair of female Canadian moose. One night, Nita asks Kenai if he ever thought of being human again. When Kenai says that he has considered it, Koda hears this and races up a mountain, anxious that Kenai may leave him. Nita finds Koda hiding in a cave, but both are caught in an avalanche and are rescued by Kenai. Kenai shouts at Koda for almost getting himself killed, but the two reconcile with Kenai assuring Koda that he will never leave him. The trio eventually make it to Hokani Falls, where they burn the amulet. Without it, Nita can no longer communicate with Kenai or Koda, so she says goodbye. Seeing how miserable Kenai is and realizing that he loves Nita, Koda secretly asks his mother in the spirit world to turn Kenai back into a human so he can be happy. The next morning, Rutt and Tuke inform Kenai that Koda went to the village to retrieve Nita. Knowing that Koda will be killed, Kenai runs after him. At the village, the tribes prepare for the wedding once again, but Nita, realizing her love for Kenai, tells her father Chilkoot that she cannot marry Atka. At that moment, Koda creates a major commotion in the village in order to get Nita's attention, while Kenai arrives to stop Koda. Rutt and Tuke rescue Koda from two of the villagers, while Atka fights with Kenai, throwing him off of a cliff and into shallow water. Nita rushes to Kenai's aide, where the two profess their love for each other. The Spirits appear to change Kenai back into a human, allowing Nita to communicate with Kenai and Koda. Kenai tells Nita that he cannot become a human again and leave Koda, but Nita tells him that she can be with him. With her father's blessing, the Spirits transform Nita into a bear. The film ends with Kenai and Nita's wedding that the tribes, bears, Koda, Rutt, Tuke and their mates happily watch.

Reception  Brother Bear 2 holds a 50% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 5.6/10 (based on 8 votes). The film is the second direct-to-video sequel to have a higher rating on Rotten Tomatoes than its predecessor, following An Extremely Goofy Movie. Enthusiastic reviews included Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures, which wrote \\"The kids will love Brother Bear 2, especially if they loved the first film. It has a good message and some decent scenes.\\" RealTalk Movie Reviews said \\"Although sequels -- even a few from Disney -- are often disappointing, this one is a keeper, mostly because of its charming story and extraordinary background music\\",http://www.reeltalkreviews.com/browse/viewitem.asp?type=review&id;=1831 and DVDTalk's Brian Orndorf said \\"As money-grabbing animated product goes, Brother Bear 2 rests nicely on a lowered expectation level, and is hardly an offensive affront to the first film. The texture and polish is deeply missed, but the characters are so strong and engaging, it still entertains.\\" David Cornelius of DVDTalk wrote \\"The story fails to impress, but everything else adds up in all the right ways to make up for it. The makers of Brother Bear 2 break the curse of the Disney sequel and turn in a welcome effort.\\" Movie Metropolis said \\"When you consider that Disney meant this production strictly for the home and it probably didn't cost nearly as much as the first film to make or market, it's actually a superior product...Brother Bear 2 may not be first-tier Disney filmmaking, but it is first-tier Disney animation, and that and the sweetness of the story line may be enough to keep even grown-ups entertained.\\" Negative reviews came from Pablo Villaca of Cinema em Cena, who said \\"sad to say ... the magic of the first film and sensitivity were replaced by cliches, ridiculous story and cheap sentimentality.\\" Reel Film Reviews said \\"There's little doubt that Brother Bear 2, for the most part, comes off as an affable yet entirely needless piece of work, as filmmaker Ben Gluck, working from Rich Burns' script, is generally unable to wholeheartedly capture and sustain the viewer's interest - with the ongoing emphasis on stand-alone segments (eg the central trio run afoul of several violent raccoons) ensuring that the movie is only sporadically engaging.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack to Brother Bear 2 was released August 15, 2006.

He is currently teaching the DJ Skills & Styles course and his research includes Hip Hop History and culture as well as Musical Composition via turntable techniques. Early life Born and raised in Jackson Heights, Queens, by Colombian heritage, Swift (born Robert Aguilar) began DJing at the age of 12 by watching his father and brother.McLeod, Rodd. \\"Rob Swift Does the Wicki-Wicki\\", Rolling Stone, May 6, 1999. Accessed May 28, 2009. \\"Swift lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, very near where he grew up.\\"\\"An Open Letter to Big Ghost Fase\\", January 9, 2012. Accessed May 10, 2012. \\"I actually started DJing 6 years before that at age 12.\\" ‚ÄúMy dad was a salsa and merengue DJ. My brother learned how to scratch and do all the hip hop deejaying stuff on my dad‚Äôs equipment (without his permission) and I‚Äôd sit there and watch him. When I entered the sixth grade, I decided I wanted to learn.‚Äù So unlike those who were influenced through hip hop records, DMC and NMS tapes, or movies, Swift educated himself with the classic turntable beats of the early 1980s New York City playground pioneers while listening to funk and jazz at home. ‚ÄúMy older brother exposed me to all that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAll the stuff I create as a DJ is rooted in the songs that I heard from Bob James, Herbie Hancock and James Brown to Quincy Jones and old DJs like Grandmaster Flash and Grand Wizard Theodore. That‚Äôs where my roots are.‚Äù In 1990, Swift enrolled as a student at Baruch College in New York City and in 1995, graduated with a degree in psychology. ‚ÄúWhile I was deejaying I pursued college. Speech class and English serve a purpose, you know?‚Äù His education can be said to translate into his cerebral style of scratching, juggling and making music. Career In 1991, Swift joined the groundbreaking turntablist crew the X-Men aka X-ecutioners (Roc Raida, Total Eclipse, and Mista Sinista). Also in 1991, he won the DMC East Coast title. In 2001, he was featured in the DJ documentary Scratch (Palm Pictures). He has appeared on ESPN, the Late Show with David Letterman and Sesame Street. In 2008, Swift was the first hip hop DJ invited to perform at the Savannah Jazz Festival in Georgia. He has collaborated with artists from many genres including Blue Man Group, Herbie Hancock, Scritti Politti, Bob James, Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, Dan The Automator, Fat Joe, Cypress Hill and Bill Laswell. He currently works solo, as part of the group Ill Insanity (featuring former X-Men Total Eclipse and Precision), or collaborating with other like-minded artists. Since January 2010, Swift has hosted the online hip-hop radio show Dope on Plastic on Scion A/V Streaming Radio 17 on which he plays mixes and interviews with guest turntablists. Guests have included J-Smoke & DJ Element, Tim Martells, and DJ Platurn. In February 2010, Rob Swift's solo 18-song turntablism-classical music fusion album The Architect was released by Mike Patton on Ipecac Recordings, which Swift dedicated to Roc Raida who died in 2009. In June 2008, Swift's girlfriend played a piece by Chopin for him on her iPod while he was shaving. Swift said, \\"For some reason on that day in my bathroom, my heart was ready to embrace this genre.\\" In July, he began work on a new album and a month or two into the recording process, he said, \\"I listened back to see how to album was starting to shape up. After sitting down and listening to it I started realizing that I was being influenced by this genre of classical that I had a new found love for ... I then started creating my music in a way that was reflective of the way that the composers created their pieces. So I started working in movements. I was using sounds and then reintroducing the sounds in other songs. And I sat down and went, 'wow!' All this time, artists like Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven were influencing me on this album subconsciously without me knowing. So once I realized that, then I decided that this album would be a take on what I feel classical composers like Mozart and Chopin would have done if they had turntables.\\"Billy Jam, Interview with Rob Swift about The Architect (Ipecac), Amoeba.com, March 1, 2010 One guest MC, Breez Evahflowin, rhymes about the album's concepts on \\"Principio\\" and \\"Ultimo\\".

In August 2012, Swift became the resident DJ for a new late night college sports TV talk show on ESPNU called UNITE. On his blog, DJ Qbert, reported Swift as saying, \\"Never would I have thought as a 12-year old that DJing would take me this far. It is something that I have always done out of pure love.

Whereas a classifier predicts a label for a single sample without considering \\"neighboring\\" samples, a CRF can take context into account. To do so, the prediction is modeled as a graphical model, which implements dependencies between the predictions. What kind of graph is used depends on the application. For example, in natural language processing, linear chain CRFs are popular, which implement sequential dependencies in the predictions. In image processing the graph typically connects locations to nearby and/or similar locations to enforce that they receive similar predictions. Other examples where CRFs are used are: labeling or parsing of sequential data for natural language processing or biological sequences, POS tagging, shallow parsing, named entity recognition, gene finding, peptide critical functional region finding, and object recognition and image segmentation in computer vision. Description CRFs are a type of discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model. Lafferty, McCallum and Pereira define a CRF on observations \\\\boldsymbol{X} and random variables \\\\boldsymbol{Y} as follows: > Let G = (V , E) be a graph such that \\\\boldsymbol{Y} = > (\\\\boldsymbol{Y}_v)_{v\\\\in V}, so that \\\\boldsymbol{Y} is indexed by the > vertices of G. Then (\\\\boldsymbol{X}, \\\\boldsymbol{Y}) is a conditional random > field when the random variables \\\\boldsymbol{Y}_v, conditioned on > \\\\boldsymbol{X}, obey the Markov property with respect to the graph: > p(\\\\boldsymbol{Y}_v \\\\boldsymbol{X}, \\\\boldsymbol{Y}_w, w eq v) = > p(\\\\boldsymbol{Y}_v \\\\boldsymbol{X}, \\\\boldsymbol{Y}_w, w \\\\sim v), where > \\\\mathit{w} \\\\sim v means that w and v are neighbors in G. What this means is that a CRF is an undirected graphical model whose nodes can be divided into exactly two disjoint sets \\\\boldsymbol{X} and \\\\boldsymbol{Y}, the observed and output variables, respectively; the conditional distribution p(\\\\boldsymbol{Y}\\\\boldsymbol{X}) is then modeled. Inference For general graphs, the problem of exact inference in CRFs is intractable. The inference problem for a CRF is basically the same as for an MRF and the same arguments hold. However, there exist special cases for which exact inference is feasible: * If the graph is a chain or a tree, message passing algorithms yield exact solutions. The algorithms used in these cases are analogous to the forward-backward and Viterbi algorithm for the case of HMMs. * If the CRF only contains pair-wise potentials and the energy is submodular, combinatorial min cut/max flow algorithms yield exact solutions. If exact inference is impossible, several algorithms can be used to obtain approximate solutions. These include: * Loopy belief propagation * Alpha expansion * Mean field inference * Linear programming relaxations Parameter Learning Learning the parameters \\\\theta is usually done by maximum likelihood learning for p(Y_iX_i; \\\\theta). If all nodes have exponential family distributions and all nodes are observed during training, this optimization is convex. It can be solved for example using gradient descent algorithms, or Quasi-Newton methods such as the L-BFGS algorithm. On the other hand, if some variables are unobserved, the inference problem has to be solved for these variables. Exact inference is intractable in general graphs, so approximations have to be used. Examples In sequence modeling, the graph of interest is usually a chain graph. An input sequence of observed variables X represents a sequence of observations and Y represents a hidden (or unknown) state variable that needs to be inferred given the observations. The Y_{i} are structured to form a chain, with an edge between each Y_{i-1} and Y_{i}. As well as having a simple interpretation of the Y_{i} as \\"labels\\" for each element in the input sequence, this layout admits efficient algorithms for: * model training, learning the conditional distributions between the Y_{i} and feature functions from some corpus of training data. * decoding, determining the probability of a given label sequence Y given X. * inference, determining the most likely label sequence Y given X. The conditional dependency of each Y_{i} on X is defined through a fixed set of feature functions of the form f(i, Y_{i-1}, Y_{i}, X), which can be thought of as measurements on the input sequence that partially determine the likelihood of each possible value for Y_{i}. The model assigns each feature a numerical weight and combines them to determine the probability of a certain value for Y_{i}. Linear-chain CRFs have many of the same applications as conceptually simpler hidden Markov models (HMMs), but relax certain assumptions about the input and output sequence distributions. An HMM can loosely be understood as a CRF with very specific feature functions that use constant probabilities to model state transitions and emissions. Conversely, a CRF can loosely be understood as a generalization of an HMM that makes the constant transition probabilities into arbitrary functions that vary across the positions in the sequence of hidden states, depending on the input sequence. Notably, in contrast to HMMs, CRFs can contain any number of feature functions, the feature functions can inspect the entire input sequence X at any point during inference, and the range of the feature functions need not have a probabilistic interpretation. Variants=Higher-order CRFs and semi-Markov CRFs CRFs can be extended into higher order models by making each Y_{i} dependent on a fixed number k of previous variables Y_{i-k}, ..., Y_{i-1}. In conventional formulations of higher order CRFs, training and inference are only practical for small values of k (such as k ‚â§ 5), since their computational cost increases exponentially with k. However, another recent advance has managed to ameliorate these issues by leveraging concepts and tools from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics. Specifically, the CRF- infinity approach constitutes a CRF-type model that is capable of learning infinitely-long temporal dynamics in a scalable fashion. This is effected by introducing a novel potential function for CRFs that is based on the Sequence Memoizer (SM), a nonparametric Bayesian model for learning infinitely-long dynamics in sequential observations. To render such a model computationally tractable, CRF-infinity employs a mean-field approximation of the postulated novel potential functions (which are driven by an SM). This allows for devising efficient approximate training and inference algorithms for the model, without undermining its capability to capture and model temporal dependencies of arbitrary length. There exists another generalization of CRFs, the semi-Markov conditional random field (semi-CRF), which models variable- length segmentations of the label sequence Y. This provides much of the power of higher-order CRFs to model long-range dependencies of the Y_{i}, at a reasonable computational cost. Finally, large-margin models for structured prediction, such as the structured Support Vector Machine can be seen as an alternative training procedure to CRFs. Latent-dynamic conditional random field Latent-dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRF) or discriminative probabilistic latent variable models (DPLVM) are a type of CRFs for sequence tagging tasks. They are latent variable models that are trained discriminatively. In an LDCRF, like in any sequence tagging task, given a sequence of observations x = x_1,\\\\dots,x_n, the main problem the model must solve is how to assign a sequence of labels y = y_1,\\\\dots,y_n from one finite set of labels . Instead of directly modeling (yx) as an ordinary linear-chain CRF would do, a set of latent variables h is \\"inserted\\" between x and y using the chain rule of probability: :P(\\\\mathbf{y}  \\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_\\\\mathbf{h} P(\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\mathbf{h}, \\\\mathbf{x}) P(\\\\mathbf{h}  \\\\mathbf{x}) This allows capturing latent structure between the observations and labels. While LDCRFs can be trained using quasi-Newton methods, a specialized version of the perceptron algorithm called the latent-variable perceptron has been developed for them as well, based on Collins' structured perceptron algorithm. These models find applications in computer vision, specifically gesture recognition from video streams and shallow parsing.

Born in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1858, he was a precocious naturalist. His family moved to West Roxbury, when he was seven. As an older child, he conducted field studies of area wildlife and also studied taxidermy. Once again, his family moved to Worcester, where he became a member of the Worcester Natural History Society, and began to publish the results of his studies. At the age of sixteen he was appointed Curator of Ornithology of the Society's museum. E.B. White, \\"Mr. Forbush's Friends,\\" p. 42. Forbush in 1917 When he was nineteen, he mounted an expedition to Florida -- this would be the first of many trips he took around the United States to study birds. In 1893, Forbush was appointed Ornithologist to the Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture. His primary studies at this time were \\"economic ornithology\\" -- that is, determining whether a given species of bird was beneficial or detrimental to agriculture. In 1908 he became the Massachusetts State Ornithologist. He was a founder of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. He was also first president of the Northeastern Bird-Banding Association (now the Association of Field Ornithologists). His work \\"Birds of Massachusetts (and Other New England States)\\" is a three-volume set of books published 1925-1929 by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture. Title notwithstanding, it was and remains a valuable reference regarding not just New England birds but also in regard to ornithology of the Northeast and farther afield. He was also known for his studies of the Heath Hen and his attempts to save the species. He died in Westborough in 1929. His wife donated a glass case containing artistically arranged ornithological specimens to the Westborough Public Library, with a plaque reading: \\"Presented by Etta L. Forbush in memory of her husband Edward Howe Forbush. All specimens collected prepared and mounted by Mr. Forbush at the age of eighteen.\\" In 1931, The Forbush Bird Club of Worcester, Mass., was established in his memory.

Tarzan II, a followup to the original film, was released in 2005. The film is set one year after the events of the first film. Plot The film makes use of a frame tale to present three self-contained \\"episodes\\" via flashback. Jane and Tarzan's first wedding anniversary has arrived, and Jane is trying to find a suitable present for her husband, with the help of the elephant Tantor and the gorilla Terk. When a party is suggested, the trio remembers the disaster that occurred when three of Jane's friends arrived for a visit. Jane had organized an English-style picnic for her friends, but Tarzan had refused to join them after believing Jane was embarrassed by his savage habits. The picnic was interrupted when two panthers, Nuru and Sheeta attacked Jane and her friends, forcing them to flee into the deeper regions of the jungle. As Jane taught her friends a few survival techniques, they were once again ambushed by the panthers, only to be saved when Tarzan rushed in. Back to the present day, Jane ponders over the idea of expensive gifts, particularly jewelry, prompting Terk to remind her of the time Tarzan tried to get her a diamond. Tarzan had led two men, Johannes Niels and Merkus to a nearby volcano containing a diamond mine and in return, they would give him one of the diamonds to give to Jane, only for them to turn on him once inside, wanting to take all the diamonds for themselves. The volcano then erupted with Tarzan, Jane, and Professor Porter trapped inside, though they managed to escape before the lava flows reached them. Tarzan then rescued Johannes and Merkus, only for them to lose their diamonds in the process. They are arrested after this and taken back to England. Professor Porter then joins the conversation, suggesting to Jane that she and Tarzan should celebrate their anniversary with a dance. This causes Terk to bring up the time Jane's old friend Robert Canler visited. Things had gone well, despite Tarzan feeling jealous and mistrusting towards Canler (claiming that he is a bad man that reminds him of Sabor), until Canler had revealed he was working as a double agent for the Germans of the German Empire during World War I and had come for a code machine disguised as a music box he gave to Jane for safekeeping. He then kidnapped her, but was tracked down and stopped by Tarzan assisted by RAF pilot Nigel Taylor, who had been on Canler's trail. Taylor commandeers Canler's plane and takes him back to England to stand trial. Having run out of ideas and realizing anniversaries would not fit in with Tarzan's uncivilized lifestyle, Jane returns to the treehouse in disappointment, only to cheer up after finding it decorated and everyone, including Tarzan, who is wearing his father's suit, had planned a surprise party to make her happy. Terk, Tantor, and the Professor had known about it all along and were simply distracting her while everyone else got the party set up. Tarzan gives Jane a diamond ring made from the same diamonds in the volcano. The celebrations start as everyone dances, including Tarzan and Jane, as the story concludes with the couple dancing under the moonlight with fireflies all around. Cast * Michael T.

TV Guide rated it 3/5 stars and called it \\"sprightly amusement for kids of all ages\\". The Legend of Tarzan This film is largely a flashback to three episodes of the TV series The Legend of Tarzan. The episodes in question are \\"Tarzan and the British Invasion\\", \\"Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine\\" and \\"Tarzan and the Flying Ace\\", the last three episodes of the show to be aired (but taking place much earlier in production order).

The film was produced by Alexander Paal and directed by Peter Sasdy, both Hungarian √©migr√©s working in England. The original music score was composed by Harry Robertson. Countess Dracula was also released on a double bill with Vampire Circus. Plot In 17th-century Hungary, recently widowed Countess Elisabeth N√°dasdy discovers that her youthful appearance and libido can be temporarily restored if she bathes in the blood of young women. She enlists her steward and lover Captain Dobi and her maid Julie to help with the kidnap and murder of several local girls, whilst having another sexual affair with a young Lieutenant, Imre Toth. As a cover for her crimes while in her rejuvenated state, she takes the identity of her own daughter, Countess Ilona, whom she has Dobi hold captive in the woods. However, castle historian Fabio grows suspicious. Eventually, she kills a prostitute called Ziza, but her blood does not restore the Countess like the others. Dobi finds Fabio, who has a book-chapter about blood sacrifices and tells Elisabeth the truth in return for being allowed to live. He says only a virgin sacrifice will help Elisabeth remain young and beautiful. She then kills more virgins, from peasant girls to the servant girls in the palace. Fabio tries to tell Toth the truth about his lover, but Dobi kills Fabio before he can do so. Dobi then shows Elisabeth to Toth to steer him away from her. Elisabeth forces Toth into marrying her, but her daughter Ilona arrives home, having been freed by a repentant Julie. Elisabeth grows old again and tries to kill her daughter, but accidentally kills Toth instead. Elisabeth, Dobi and her maid are sentenced to death for their crimes and are last seen awaiting the hangman in their cell.

It was produced by DisneyToon Studios Australia and animation production by Toon City Animation. It was released on DVD and VHS on June 14, 2005. The film tells the story of young Tarzan's adventure to discover who he really is. Glenn Close and Lance Henriksen reprise their roles as Kala and Kerchak from the first film while Harrison Chad, Brenda Grate, and Harrison Fahn are the new voices for the younger versions of Tarzan, Terk, and Tantor, replacing Alex D. Linz, Rosie O'Donnell, and Taylor Dempsey. They are joined by new characters voiced by George Carlin, Estelle Harris, Brad Garrett, and Ron Perlman. Plot As a human orphan being raised by a family of gorillas after his parents were killed in an African jungle, Tarzan is worried that a fabled monster known as the Zugor will someday attempt to capture him. He is disappointed that he can't run as quickly as the other young apes in his family, and his attempts to prove himself keep resulting in chaos, disappointing his father, Kerchak. When an accident leads his ape mother, Kala, to think Tarzan has died after the gorillas have crossed a ravine, the other apes feel that Tarzan has reached a fitting end. Tarzan believes it's best for everyone involved if he runs away. Alone in the jungle, Tarzan gets chased by Sabor the leopardess to a rocky place known as the Dark Mountain. When the echo of the monster calls, Sabor runs away just as Tarzan is encountered by two hulking, spoiled gorilla brothers, Uto and Kago, and their controlling, over-protective mother Mama Gunda. They fear the Zugor as much as Tarzan does, and when the booming call of the monster again echoes through the valley, the trio flee and Tarzan is able to escape Dark Mountain. He encounters a crotchety old gorilla who at first keeps the boy distant, but Tarzan discovers this gorilla is actually named Zugor and was pretending to be the monster. He uses hollow trees as megaphones to amplify his voice and pretend to be a monster, scaring other jungle creatures away from his territory and food. Tarzan uses this discovery to blackmail Zugor into letting the boy stay with him. Thanks to Tarzan's cheerfulness and helpfulness, Zugor begins to warm up to him. Tarzan continues to try to figure out what he is along with Zugor, but they both promise not to tell anyone. Meanwhile, Tarzan's two best friends, the young gorilla Terk and the young elephant Tantor, come looking for him, and Kala also finds out that Tarzan is alive, so she goes looking for him as well. Terk and Tantor encounter trouble in Dark Mountain in the form of Mama Gunda, Uto, and Kago, but they are able to escape. Terk and Tantor eventually reunite with Tarzan, and the three become best friends once again. They leave Dark Mountain, and Mama Gunda, Uto, and Kago follow them. Tarzan does not want to return home with them but he reveals that there is no monster. Mama Gunda, Uto, and Kago overhear their conversation and learn it was Zugor who was pretending to be the monster; he gets himself into trouble. Uto and Kago wreck Zugor's treehouse in retaliation for scaring them. Zugor blames Tarzan for breaking his promise and runs away, refusing to help him face the brothers. Terk and Tantor run to go and warn Kerchak. Kala arrives near Dark Mountain and also encounters trouble with Mama Gunda, Uto and Kago. Tarzan finally realizes what he is supposed to be: a \\"Tarzan\\", with his own special tricks that no one else can do in the jungle, Zugor comes to a similar realization, at which he returns to Tarzan and reconciles with him. Tarzan is able to use tricks and traps to defeat Uto and Kago as Terk and Tantor try to save Kala from falling off a cliff; Tarzan saves Kala just in time. whereas Zugor holds Mama Gunda hostage, but due to their connection and Zugor accidentally telling Mama Gunda that she has \\"beautiful eyes\\", they both fall in love. Uto and Kago return and are shocked to see them together. Tarzan tells Kala that she was right before and he is a part of her gorilla family. As the movie ends, Tarzan, Kala, Terk, and Tantor return to the gorilla troop. Kala gives Tarzan a hug and tells him how proud she is of him for rescuing her from the fall and from Uto and Kago. Mama Gunda punishes her sons for destroying Zugor's treehouse and tells them that there won't be any more fighting or wrecking things. Tarzan, Terk, and Tantor decide to play a monster game; Tarzan is now happy and proud of himself, as he now knows what he is supposed to be. Voice cast * Harrison Chad as Tarzan, a young human orphan raised by gorillas in the jungle. Tarzan was a socially awkward kid struggling to fit in with his ape family. When he was growing up, Tarzan had a childhood fear of the Zugor, a mythical monster said to live on Dark mountain. His second fear was that his mother Kala would get hurt because of him. * Glenn Close as Kala, Tarzan's adoptive gorilla mother loves her son more than anything. Kala is caring and patient unless provoked, or if her family is in danger. * Brenda Grate as Terk, Tarzan's sardonic, quick-witted, and mischievous \\"cousin\\". Her full name is Terkina, but she actually goes by Terk. * Harrison Fahn as Tantor, a germophobic, neurotic elephant, whose best friends are Terk and Tarzan despite these impediments. * Lance Henriksen as Kerchak, Kala's mate and the leader of the gorilla family in the jungle who holds a dislike on Tarzan because of his human appearance. * George Carlin as Zugor, an old hermit ape living in a hollow tree on Dark Mountain. He is the \\"monster\\" feared by Tarzan and almost all the animals, even Sabor before she was killed by the adult version of Tarzan in the first film. * Estelle Harris as Mama Gunda, a loud, intimidating, physically short and short-tempered mother of Kago and Uto. * Brad Garrett as Uto, a slow-witted, immature, and cowardly ape who likes to throw any creature he finds off a cliff to see if they can fly. * Ron Perlman as Kago, an aggressive, physically imposing silverback, and an all around bully. A running gag is that he always gets the hiccups when he gets poked around. * Frank Welker as Animals/Rhino and Bird/Sabor the Leopardess. Reception The film was nominated at the 33rd Annie Awards for Best Home Entertainment Production. The film holds a score of 33% on Rotten Tomatoes based on six reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tarzan_ii/?search=tarzan%20ii Music The film features two new songs written and performed by Phil Collins, \\"Leaving Home (Find My Way)\\" and \\"Who Am I?\\" (the latter also performed by Tiffany Evans), and it also reuses Collins' \\"Son of Man\\" from the original film. Mark Mancina, the first film's composer, returned to compose the score for the sequel, joined by Dave Metzger. \\"Leaving Home\\" later became the song \\"I Need to Know\\" for the Broadway musical version of Tarzan.

The combe cuts into the western edge of the Lulsgate Plateau, the Carboniferous limestone hills which form a northern outlier of the Mendips, south west of Bristol. Bristol International Airport lies at the top of the combe. A minor road runs along the length of the combe, meeting the A370 at the lower end, near the village of Brockley. The name arises as a very rare co-joining of two Brythonic words; combe meaning 'a small deep dry valley, easily defended', and Brock meaning 'badger'. Combe is spelt differently in other part of the United Kingdom as Coombe and Coomb, but the meanings are the same. The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland, published in 1868, describes Brockley Combe as follows: \\"Near the village, on the south-east, is Brockley Coomb, a deep narrow glen, of singular beauty, sunk between steep rocks, rising at some points to the height of 300 feet. It is adorned with many noble trees, and all the fissures and ledges of the cliffs are enriched with a great variety of mosses and other forms of vegetation. Lead ore is found here, and there are masses of columnar basalt.\\" Two identically named poems were written about the combe. Brockley Coomb by British Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which is subtitled Lines composed while climbing the left ascent of Brockley Coomb, May 1795; and Brockley Coomb by British poet Arthur Hugh Clough. John Marius Wilson said that Brockley Combe was a \\"favourite resort of Coleridge\\". To the south is another, more undisturbed, combe, Goblin Combe. Brockley Hall Forestry is carried out in the surrounding woodland. Down from the A370 is a Georgian manor house called Brockley Hall, this was inhabited by the Piggott-Smyths family until later in its life.

It is the first book of the Xanth series. Plot introduction In this adventure, Bink is exiled to Mundania because he has (inadvertently) broken Xanth law by not having a magical talent. He returns to Xanth with Chameleon, a woman whose intelligence and beauty vary inversely depending on the time of the month, and the evil magician Trent who was exiled 20 years earlier for attempting to usurp the throne of Xanth. Plot summary The book starts with the main character, Bink in his home town. He must discover his magical talent before he comes of age, or be exiled to Mundania. While on his way to see the Good Magician Humfrey about whether he has a magic talent, Bink runs into three different women, Wynne, Dee, and Iris, as well as Chester and Cherie Centaur and Crombie The Soldier. He finds out from Good Magician Humfrey that he has Magician-caliber magic but that it can't be identified. Because his talent cannot be discovered, Bink is exiled to Mundania, the land of no magic. While there, he is captured by the Evil Magician Trent, who was exiled 20 years ago for attempting to overthrow the current king. Trent is trying to invade Xanth with his Mundane army to usurp the throne but has been consistently prevented from entering by the magic barrier which surrounds Xanth. He believes that Bink can help him get into Xanth by providing information on the location of the source of the magical barrier, and attempts to coerce Bink into giving him this information. Trent has prepared a special elixir that can temporarily nullify magic and has a special catapult that can hurl this elixir into the land of Xanth. All that Trent needs now are the exact coordinates of the shield-stone. Bink refuses to cooperate and is thrown into a pit with a woman from Xanth that has followed him there named Fanchon. Bink and Fanchon escape to sea but are pursued by Trent's forces. Eventually, Bink, Trent, and Fanchon are all swept into Xanth via a whirlpool but Trent's forces are left behind. The trio decides to declare a truce until they can safely make their way out of the wilderness. While travelling, the group discovers Castle Roogna, a castle built 800 years ago by one of the early Kings of Xanth but abandoned 400 years later. Here, Bink learns that Fanchon, Wynne, and Dee are all the same person named Chameleon. Castle Roogna is haunted by relatively benign ghosts and zombies and is an area of heightened magical power. The castle in fact seems to possess some form of awareness and had actually used its control of the surrounding area to herd the trio onto its grounds. It detected the presence of two magician-caliber talents in the group (Bink and Trent) and lured them there in the hopes that one of them could become king and restore the castle to its former glory. The group leaves Castle Roogna on their way to the see the King but are eventually forced to break their truce when Bink refuses to join Trent in taking over Xanth. While they are arguing, Iris of illusion shows up and offers to marry Trent and help him become King. Iris craves power, but as a woman she is barred from ruling Xanth so she has decided that the next best thing is to marry a King. Trent and Bink agree to a duel to the death or surrender: If Bink loses then he will stay out of Trent's way but If he wins then Trent will cease his efforts to gain the throne. In the course of this duel Trent deduces Bink's unknown talent, which is that he cannot be harmed by magic. Because Bink is still vulnerable to non-magical harm his talent has gone to great lengths to conceal itself over the years. In any case where Bink could have been harmed by magic he has always been saved by what appears to be a series of coincidences. Because of interference from Iris Trent declares that the duel must be restarted, but now thanks to his knowledge of Bink's talent, Trent has the upper hand. He is about to kill Bink when Chameleon dives in front of the sword. Trent and Bink then call a truce so that they can obtain healing elixir to save her life. Bink eventually gets to the Good Magician's Castle in the form of a bird, having been transformed by Trent. Not only does Bink manage to get the healing elixir, but he also manages to find out that the Storm King has died. All the officials of Xanth, including the Council of Elders (which includes Bink's father Roland), arrive on the scene. The Council captures Trent, heals Chameleon, and offers Trent the kingship if he will marry Iris. The Storm King was allowed to remain King well past his prime because there was no suitable successor and by forcing Trent to marry (and presumably produce magician-caliber offspring) the council hopes to prevent that state of affairs from occurring again. Trent's first act as King is to get rid of the magical barrier between Xanth and Mundania and grant Bink (and non-magical folk in general including mundanes) the right to stay in Xanth. Trent's forces, who consisted of mundanes who wished to immigrate to Xanth begin to settle in various regions of the magical land. Bink and Chameleon are then married and Trent and Iris take up residence in Castle Roogna. Bink and Chameleon obtain a cottage just outside the Castle and Bink is given the title of Official researcher of Xanth.

The Tajrish neighbourhood is located along the northern edge of Tehran. This neighbourhood is one of the oldest parts of Tehran and during the last few decades, has become popular with the wealthy by virtue of the low levels of pollution, in turn created by the area's favorable location along Tehran's northern hills. Tajrish is situated in the Shemiranat County. As of 2006, the neighborhood had 86,000 inhabitants.  Etymology  The name Tajrish (ÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±€åÿ¥) is given from the Tat language which was the common language of Shemiran area before choosing Tehran as the capital. Middle Persian tigr means \\"arrow\\", in the same family as Old Persian tigra- \\"pointed\\" (compare tigra-xauda), Modern Persian t√™z \\"sharp\\" because of its mountainous topography and also Tajrish river in this region. Tigris in Mesopotamia has a same name and etymology. In the bygone years, due to the influence of the Mongolians' pronunciation, \\"Tajrish\\" was called \\"Tajresht\\". Then, gradually, the modernized pronunciation of it has become \\"Tajrish\\" which is used nowadays.  History  Until the 1920s, Tajrish and neighboring Shemiranat were a collection of small villages along Tehran's border, often used as a summer retreat by city residents. The area was relatively disconnected from Tehran's urban with the exception of Old Shemiran Road, currently known as Shariati Avenue. With the construction of Pahlavi Road (now named Valiasr Ave) in 1930s and Modarres Highway, then known as Shahanshahi Boulevard, the Northern suburbs became highly accessible from downtown and rapid extension became possible.  Modern  Tajrish has an old bazaar and a mausoleum called Imam Zadeh Saleh, both popular tourist spots. Tajrish Square is currently one of the busiest parts of Tehran, with bus terminals, cab terminals, and shopping malls including the popular Tandis Center. The square is where Valiasr Street terminates. Valiasr is the longest and, along with Shariati Avenue, one of the most important streets in Tehran. It is also one of the busiest transportation hubs in Tehran. Many other suburbs are accessible from this square. A major metro station, the northern terminus of line one (the red line) is located here. Tajrish is the at the junction of streets that lead to Saad Abad Palace, Velenjak, Asad Abad, Zafaraniyeh, Elahieh, and Niavaran as well as many of the other places in northern Tehran.  Elevation  Tajrish Square is 1612 meters above sea level.elevation from google earth  Tajrish Bazaar  The traditional bazaar of Tajrish neighborhood will be renovated over 18 months at an estimated cost of about 28 billion rials. The Deputy head of Tehran Beautification Organization for technical affairs, announced that the bazaar is close to Emamzadeh Saleh Mausoleum as well as Velenjak, Darband and Darakeh mountain resorts and its renovation is a top priority for Tehran Beautification Organization. The official noted that the project will include reconstruction of the traditional market using both traditional and modern styles, wastewater collection, power, gas, telecommunication installations, as well as repair of small and large shops and passageways. Tajrish bazaar has been built according to architectural style which closely resembles the traditional bazaar located in downtown Tehran. Some of its arches have been destroyed due to construction of multi-story buildings and its traditional identity has been threatened by irregularity of window shops and external view of new stores. ‚ÄúAccording to ratification by Tehran Municipality, the bazaar will be organized according to a new plan which will be implemented in cooperation with Tehran Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization. ‚Äù The official further stated that the project will take 18 solar months and the cost of organizing this economic and trade center in north Tehran has been estimated at about 28 billion rials.

King Trent has left Xanth on a mission of trade to Mundania and has left Dor as temporary king. When Trent fails to return after some time, Dor must find a way to rescue Trent. He is informed that the means to rescue Trent lies to the south on Centaur Isle, the home of a tribe of centaurs. Plot Xanth's King Trent has left for dreary Mundania, leaving Dor to practice governing the magical kingdom. Dor's magical talent is communication with the inanimate which for information gathering is very helpful, but for dealing with citizens needing discipline it leaves room for improvement. But when Trent goes to establish trade routes with Mundania, Dor and his friends (a golem named Grundy, the centaur Chet, Smash the ogre, and Dor's love interest, King Trent's daughter Princess Irene) must keep the land in line. However, the former King Trent does not return when he had planned. After waiting two weeks, Dor gathers his gang and goes on a quest to help rescue Trent. This mission leads them to Centaur Isle, to find an unknown Centaur Magician. Centaurs are very negative about magical talents, so when they find Arnolde the Centaur and discover his talent, he is exiled and willing to help them rescue Trent. Arnolde's talent is a magical aisle, creating a field of magic around him that allows anyone to use magic in Mundania. The gang (minus Chet) travel north by rainbow to Mundania. While in Mundania, they find a scholar named Ichabod. From him, they learn that they are in the wrong time strand and must go back to Xanth and re-cross the border. Eventually Dor and his friends find the correct strand and go to the castle where they think Trent and his wife Iris were last.

Plot introduction Smash the half-ogre (offspring of Crunch the ogre and a human Curse Fiend acting like an ogre) goes to see the Good Magician Humfrey to get his question answered, although he doesn't know what his question is. The magician's answer: Travel to the Ancestral Ogres to find what you seek. His payment is to guard Tandy, a half-nymph, for one year. They travel about the magical land of Xanth, and Smash acquires other young women who travel with him and whom he protects. Along the way, he is infected with the Eye Queue vine, which makes him intelligent (although actually invoking his human half) making him distressed as ogres are not supposed to be smart in any way. As he tries to find an antidote to his intelligence, he undergoes several adventures; saving Tandy from the dream realm in a plant called a hypnogourd and smashing the Gap Dragon. Soon he finds matches and finds solutions to all of the women, who leave one by one. Plot summary The book starts off with Tandy the half-nymph being sexually harassed by the nasty demon Fiant while trying to sleep. She has the talent of throwing tantrums that can stun or destroy, but her talent is ineffective against the demon, so she decides to visit her father Crombie at Castle Roogna to see if he can help. Having no means of travel, however, she decides to catch a night mare to take her there. She succeeds, at the price of being battered, except the mare takes her to the Good Magician's castle instead, where she is admitted without challenges due to the difficulties she went through riding the mare. Cut to a year later, we find Smash the half-ogre travelling to the Good Magician Humfrey seeking to solve a vague dissatisfaction about himself. Using the best of his ogre qualities (strength and naive stupidity), plus his clumsy knowledge of human customs, as well as the occasional bright flash of human intelligence, he navigates his way into the Magician's castle passing various obstacles such as a basilisk and a pond of firewater. Once Smash gains entrance, though, he is too stupid to formulate his question. Magician Humphrey gives him an answer anyway, telling him to travel to the Ancestral Ogres and take Tandy with him, and guard her. On their travels, Smash and Tandy blunder into an Eye Queue vine, which embeds itself into Smash's head and provides him with human intelligence so he converses in the human way instead of spouting simple ogre rhymes. He soon discovers that the vine also helps give him good ideas, as not all the problems he and Tandy encounter can be bashed to pieces. After the vine, they encounter an assortment of females of various magical races, each needing to fulfill a personal quest including a dryad who needs to protect her tree from woodsmen, the wingless fairy John looking for her similarly incorrectly named counterpart to switch back, Centaur Chem, a longtime friend with the talent of magic mapping who wants to chart more of Xanth, Blythe Brassie who accidentally leaves her hypnogourd homeworld to come to the real Xanth, a mermaid looking for love, and others. Unfortunately also during their travels, Tandy gets trapped in the hypnogourd world and has her soul wrenched from her, though she is later freed by the others. Smash enters back into the gourd and forages a deal with the world's spokesperson (in the form of a coffin): Smash will give his soul to the gourd under a 90-day lien in exchange for Tandy's soul. He then has 90 days to find the dread Night Stallion, ruler of the gourd world, and negotiate to void the lien. As the travels continue, each female does find what she is looking for, eventually, although Smash's strength saps out of him a little at a time as his soul is gradually recalled as the days pass. Smash makes periodic forays into the gourd world, with the help of a magical and infinite ball of string to mark his way, in search of the Night Stallion, overcoming various world challenges, most of which require both his ogre strength and human intelligence to solve. Finally, when only Chem and Tandy are left with Smash, they come upon the dread Elements region and face a flood in the water region that washes off the Eye Queue vine from Smash's head, right before they enter the most dangerous Void region. As they enter the void, they come to realize that they are trapped and must find a way to get out, which they can't do without Smash's useful intelligence. Smash, using the Void's properties, manages to get his illusion of intelligence back (though at this point it is no longer illusory), and enter the gourd one last time, where he finally finds the Night Stallion and faces new challenges that require all his newfound human intelligence as well as his ogre strength and stubbornness to overcome. Once Smash conquers the Night Stallion's challenges and wins back his soul, he realizes his human side and falls in love with Tandy, putting his own soul in jeopardy again to save her, but through another deal ends up with only half a soul and half his ogre strength. He finally does arrive at the home of the Ancestral Ogres but notes how stupid and ugly they really are and decides he does not want to stay with them, though, when they threaten Tandy he commits to fighting to save her. After Tandy sacrifices her own soul mid-battle to save Smash (giving him full ogre strength) so he can defeat the ancestral ogres, Smash finally comes to true terms with his human side, even transforming himself into a human so he can make love to Tandy properly. As Smash and Tandy journey home, they again run into Demon Fiant. As a man, Smash is no match for the demon, but manages to transform back to ogre form, and is able to defeat Fiant permanently, though again his human intelligence is needed to win this battle.

Schottky. In elemental crystals it refers to simple lattice vacancies, also called valency defects. In ionic crystals, this defect forms when oppositely charged ions leave their lattice sites and become incorporated for instance at the surface, creating oppositely charged vacancies. These vacancies are formed in stoichiometric units, to maintain an overall neutral charge in the ionic solid. Definition Schottky defects consist of unoccupied anion and cation sites in a stoichiometric ratio. For a simple ionic crystal of type A‚àíB+, a Schottky defect consists of a single anion vacancy (A) and a single cation vacancy (B), or v + v following Kr√∂ger‚ÄìVink notation. For a more general crystal with formula AxBy, a Schottky cluster is formed of x vacancies of A and y vacancies of B, thus the overall stoichiometry and charge neutrality are conserved. Conceptually, a Schottky defect is generated if the crystal is expanded by one unit cell, whose a priori empty sites are filled by atoms that diffused out of the interior, thus creating vacancies in the crystal. Schottky defects are observed most frequently when there is a small difference in size between the cations and anions that make up a material. Illustration Chemical equations in Kr√∂ger‚ÄìVink notation for the formation of Schottky defects in TiO2 and BaTiO3. :‚àÖ v + 2 v :‚àÖ v + v + 3 v This can be illustrated schematically with a two-dimensional diagram of a sodium chloride crystal lattice: The defect-free NaCl structure Schottky defects within the NaCl structure Bound and dilute defects Fluorite structure. Spheres represent atoms, cubes represent vacancies. The vacancies that make up the Schottky defects have opposite charge, thus they experience a mutually attractive Coulomb force. At low temperature, they may form bound clusters. The bound clusters are typically less mobile than the dilute counterparts, as multiple species need to move in a concerted motion for the whole cluster to migrate. This has important implications for numerous functional ceramics used in a wide range of applications, including ion conductors, Solid oxide fuel cells and nuclear fuel. Examples This type of defect is typically observed in highly ionic compounds, highly coordinated compounds, and where there is only a small difference in sizes of cations and anions of which the compound lattice is composed. Typical salts where Schottky disorder is observed are NaCl, KCl, KBr, CsCl and AgBr. For engineering applications, Schottky defects are important in oxides with Fluorite structure, such as CeO2, cubic ZrO2, UO2, ThO2 and PuO2. Effect on density Typically, the formation volume of a vacancy is positive: the lattice contraction due to the strains around the defect does not make up for the expansion of the crystal due to the additional number of sites. Thus, the density of the solid crystal is less than the theoretical density of the material.

The protagonist of this story is Eskil \\"Esk\\" Ogre, only son of Tandy Nymph and Smash Ogre. His talent is to protest; when Esk says \\"No!\\" he really means it. Those he directs this talent at literally stop what they have intended to do. Esk goes to ask Good Magician Humfrey how to get rid of the Demoness Metria, who has seemingly threatened his family. Unfortunately, Humphrey has gone missing. Plot summary On his way to the Good Magician's castle, Esk meets Chex, the winged centaur daughter of Xap Hippogryph and Chem Centaur. Despite having wings, Chex is unable to fly due to her solid equine weight; she is going to ask Humfrey how she can fly. Later, the two of them meet up with Volney Vole, who always replaces S's with V's during speech. Volney has a demon problem of his own, as his home by the Kiss-Me River has become unbearably infested with bugs ever since the demons decided to straighten out the river's undulating curves. When they discover the Good Magician is missing, they decide to look for him. On the way, they go through a Hypnogourd, where bad dreams are manufactured. Esk meets Bria Brassie, a heavy brass woman, and they fall in love. The team discovers that Chex can make items temporarily light when she flicks them with her tail, which provides a solution to her problem of how to fly.

It is the second book of a trilogy beginning with Vale of the Vole and ending with Man from Mundania. Plot introduction The protagonist of Heaven Cent is Prince Dolph, shapeshifting son of King Dor and Queen Irene and younger brother of Princess Ivy. The story begins with Dolph, a pre-teen, setting out on a Quest with his designated Adult Companion Marrow Bones to locate the magician Humfrey, who had been missing since Vale of the Vole. Plot summary The story begins with Prince Dolph lying in his sister, Ivy's, bed watching her magical tapestry which shows images from the past and present of Xanth. Dolph is the son of King Dor and Queen Irene, and he has the powerful talent of being able to shapeshift, giving him the power to change into any animal he chooses. While watching the images of the magical tapestry Dolph begins to think about the disappearance of the Good Magician Humphrey. Dolph gets so enraptured with the thought of finding the Magician that he eventually asks his father and mother permission to set out on a quest to find the answers. Queen Irene decides that Dolph is at a fine age to set out for a quest, but as long as he takes with him an adult companion. After some debate and arguing over who should accompany Dolph, Dolph suggests that Marrow Bones accompany him. Marrow is a walking, talking skeleton who has the ability to transform his skeletal body into many shapes as long as Dolph gives him a good kick in the tail bone first. Once Dolph and Marrow set out on their journey they realize their first stop must be at the Good Magician Humfrey's castle to investigate for any clues to his disappearance. Once in the castle Dolph and Marrow find a hidden room that can only be viewed through a clear rock from above. In the hidden room is a message that reads \\"Skeleton Key to Heaven Cent\\". Marrow distinguishes that there is a pun in the message, and a Skeleton Key is really an island made of coral. So Dolph and Marrow set out to find the isle and find the Heaven Cent to bring back the Good Magician Humphrey. Throughout Dolph and Marrow's adventures through the land of Xanth they encounter many different creatures. There are the always rhyming ogres, bone hungry and smelly harpies, the cruel merwomen, and many others. One of the major creatures that come into play in the book are the nagas. The nagas are a snake-human people who have the power to transform into either a full snake, full human, or mixed form. Dolph and Marrow encounter the nagas when trying to get through a goblin kingdom where the goblins are holding Nada, the naga princess, prisoner. After rescuing Nada, Dolph and Marrow return to the naga kingdom, where Dolph, even though too young, becomes unintentionally betrothed to Nada through a naga tradition. Nada joins Dolph and Marrow on their quest to find the Heaven Cent, and their romantic relationship blossoms until Nada reveals to Dolph that she is actually many years older than he is. Although Dolph is taken aback by this information, his love for Nada does not waver and he keeps the betrothal intact. When Dolph, Marrow, and Nada finally find the right island where the Heaven Cent is supposed to be they encounter a magical castle where a maiden has been under a magical sleep for 900 years of a 1000-year sentence. The sleeping maiden is named Electra, and she was put under the sleeping spell because 900 years ago she accidentally activated the Heaven Cent. Dolph kisses the sleeping Electra and awakens her, but to Dolph's surprise Electra cannot survive unless she marries the person who broke the spell on her. Once the entire party returns to Castle Roogna Dolph is left with the decision about what to do with his two betrothed women. After much debate with both women and the King and Queen, Dolph asks for the test of the roses. Dolph chooses the yellow rose for Electra showing friendship and the red rose for Nada representing love. Electra is the first of the betrothed to attempt the test and she quickly chooses the red rose for Dolph representing love. Nada goes second and tries to pick the red rose, but she cannot because she does not truly love him and she is pricked by a rose. Nada then tries to pick a black rose and commit suicide, but Dolph jumps over to her and stops her. Dolph explains that he loves Nada even though the love is not returned. In the end Dolph remains betrothed to each girl even though the King and Queen do not believe in it, but Dolph and the girls believe that, in the next seven years before Dolph can marry, they will work out all the problems. The Test of the Roses The test of the roses is when one person stands in the center of a garden of different colored roses. Each rose color stands for a different emotion: white for indifference, yellow for friendship, pink for romance, red for love, and black for death. The person being decided over stands on a pillar in the middle of the garden, then the person trying to show their emotions walks around the garden and picks the appropriate colored rose for how they feel about the person in the middle of the garden.

The twelfth book of the Xanth series, it concludes the trilogy of Vale of the Vole and Heaven Cent. Plot introduction The protagonist of Man from Mundania is seventeen-year-old Princess Ivy, daughter of King Dor and Queen Irene, older sister to Prince Dolph. Due to her ancestor Bink's deal in the second Xanth novel, The Source of Magic, Ivy has a magician-caliber magical talent of being able to selectively enhance the world around her to match her expectations. The story begins when Ivy decides to use the Heaven Cent, located by Dolph in the previous book Heaven Cent, to find the Good Magician Humfrey, who had been missing since Vale of the Vole. Plot summary Princess Ivy sets off with her younger brother's co-fiancees Nada Naga and Electra to retrieve the magic mirror that had been stolen by the evil machine Com-Pewter, in preparation for her quest to find Good Magician Humfrey. After besting Com-Pewter in a battle of wits, Ivy uses the charged-up Heaven Cent to transport her to Humfrey's location. Meanwhile, in Mundania, an average college boy named Grey Murphy runs a computer program that claims that it will help him meet women. Sure enough, after installing the \\"Worm\\" program, Grey meets a series of appropriately named girls who move into the neighboring apartment, starting with Agenda and moving on through Dyslexia and Euphoria. When Ivy arrives, disorientated to find herself in Mundania, Grey starts to fall for her despite her claims that she is a princess from a fantasy world called Xanth. When Ivy wants to go home, Grey agrees to go with her, even though he doesn't believe that Xanth exists. Even when they've entered Xanth, Grey finds a scientific basis for the fantastical things he sees. His feelings for Ivy grow stronger, although Ivy knows that her regal parents won't allow her to marry a non- magician. The two of them take a trip through the Hypnogourd, where bad dreams are manufactured. After exiting the gourd, Grey, still skeptical of Xanth's magic, turns the Maenads' wine spring into water. Nada realizes his talent: magic nullification - which is a magician-caliber talent. It emerges that Grey is the son of Evil Magician Murphy and Vadne, both banished from Xanth in the book Castle Roogna, although they had never revealed their origins to him.

There, Che and Jenny learn why the goblins had kidnapped Che in the first place: they wanted him to be the tutor and companion to Gwendolyn, a young goblin princess who was lame and mostly blind. Because the goblins only respect strength and power, Gwendolyn needed to be able to conceal her physical disabilities by riding on Che's back - otherwise she would be overthrown and killed.

Ecclesiastical provinces (colored) and dioceses of France in 1789 Historical sketch Most of them were created during the first Christianization of Gaul, in the 3rd to 5th centuries. But, at several occasions during the Middle Ages or the Ancien R√©gime, new dioceses were created, replacing older ones or carved out of them. For instance, the Albigensian Crusade entailed the creation of many new dioceses in the early 14th century. All the same, in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, the ecclesiastical map of France still very much recalled that of Roman Gaul. This explains why many dioceses and provinces did not coincide with French borders, with their head cities lying in present-day Belgium, Germany or Switzerland. In 1790, this map was entirely revised to fit the new administrative map: dioceses were now to coincide with d√©partements (the new administrative units). Ancien R√©gime dioceses all disappeared, then, in 1790. Many former bishoprics remained heads of the new dioceses, but many cities lost their bishop. Even so, in those cities, the former cathedral very often kept its rank as a cathedral church. This explains why many post-Revolutionary episcopal sees bear the name of several cities. For instance, in the d√©partement of the Dr√¥me, only the city of Valence retained its bishop, the former episcopal sees of Die and Saint-Paul-Trois-Ch√¢teaux being suppressed, but the bishop retained the title of bishop of Valence, Die and Saint-Paul- Trois-Ch√¢teaux. Here follows a list of Ancien R√©gime dioceses, as of 1789, on the eve of the Revolution. With the exception of those dioceses which were created in the Late Roman period (before the 6th century), whose date of creation generally cannot be established, we provide the date of creation and, when appropriated of suppression of the bishopric.

It is somewhwat based on the 1985 arcade game Penguin Wars. In Amiga Power's first All Time Top One Hundred in the inaugural 'Issue 0', it was declared to be the 100th best Amiga game of all time. It never reappeared in the top 100 and its initial inclusion was said to be due to the insistence of a single writer. In March 2017 the source code of the game became available via the Internet Archive.Grand Monster Slam (Source Code) by Rolf Lakaemper, Hartwig Niedergassel on the Internet Archive (March 8, 2017)  Gameplay  The game is based on the fictional Grand Monster Slam tournament set on the fantasy world of GhoID. The competitors of Grand Monster Slam are drawn from staple fantasy races including trolls, orcs, ogres and imps. The player plays an unnamed dwarf. The final boss is a golden goblin named Winner, based on the logo of the developer, Golden Goblins.  Tournament  The game involves two leagues of eight competitors each, and a final league with three \\"boss\\" characters with supernatural abilities. In each league the player must compete in a knockout tournament, and, if he wins the final, successfully complete a game of Faulton Feeding (see below) to advance to the next league. Upon becoming champion of the third and final league the player is awarded the Gold Medal and the Yellow Jerkin by the King. If the player loses a match, he is made the King's fool. If he has made it past the first league, he will be given the opportunity to begin the league again, but will lose all his points.  Rules  The standard game of Grand Monster Slam takes place on a small pitch, apparently about the same size as a tennis court. Each of the two players stands on each end. On each side of the court six Beloms (also known as 'Boms') are lined up. The aim of Grand Monster Slam is to kick all one's Beloms over to the opposite side, then run across the pitch to claim victory. When kicked across Beloms land at the back of the pitch, then move to occupy one of the six spot's on the player's line as soon as one is free. To succeed the player must try to hit his opponent with his Beloms in order to knock him off his feet, thus briefly preventing him from kicking his own Beloms across the pitch. Gameplay is a mixture of dodging the opponent's Beloms while accurately kicking one's own in order to knock them down. The Beloms themselves are brown, spherical ball-like creatures with faces, which tremble as the player approaches them. The pitch is separated from the spectator stands by a low wall. If a Belom is kicked over the wall, the Belom player receives a 'Pelvan' (penalty). A duck-like creature descends from above the pitch on a rope and makes its way to the opposite end of the field. The penalty-taker then kicks the Pelvan-creature, and the other must move to try to save it. If he fails to catch the Pelvan, three Beloms move from the opponent's end to his (if the opponent has less than four Beloms left on his end, enough move so that he only has one left). If he catches it, one Belom moves to the opponent's end. The Pelvan can either by kicked left, right, or straight ahead, and the receiver can move in the same directions, so any Pelvan has a one-in-three chance of being saved. In the first league, the pitch is empty. In the second and third leagues the two opponents are separated by a low wall with a gap in the middle. This has two consequences: the balls must be kicked with more force to get them over the wall, and the players must finish in the middle of the pitch after having gotten rid of all the Beloms in order to run across through the gap.  Mini-games  Grand Monster Slam has two mini-games, which appear in between the main matches. They can also be practised from the main menu.  Revenge of the Beloms  Revenge of the Beloms takes place after every quarter-final and semi-final. The player is surrounded by eight Beloms at the compass points, which attack him one by one. They give warning as to which one will attack next by kicking up dust just before they move in. The player must fend them off with a weapon resembling a barbell that acts like a pugil stick. If a Belom gets past the player's weapon, he is tripped over, the other Beloms gleefully pile in and bounce up and down on his body, and the mini-game ends. Before each game the King gives the player a target to meet, which gets higher throughout the tournament. Depending on how many Beloms were fended off relative to this target, the player will either lose some of the points awarded in the previous round or gain bonus points.  Faulton Feeding  After winning the final of the first and second leagues, the player must complete a game of Faulton Feeding. This takes place on the same pitch as the main games, with six Beloms lined up in front of the player as usual, and six Faultons, which resemble frogs, lined up on pillars on the opposite side. The player must kick the Beloms into the Faultons' open mouths, which involves applying the right amount of power so that the Beloms do not fly over or under the Faultons. In the first game of Faulton Feeding, the player must successfully feed at least two Faultons; in the second he must feed four. If he succeeds, he advances to the next league; if he fails, he must begin the league again.

The Companions of Xanth computer game was marketed in a box set along with this novel. The game and novel share a storyline in which Kim and Dug, two Mundane teenagers, play a mysterious computer game that magically transports them to the realm of Xanth to compete for a one-of-a-kind prize: a magical talent. In the actual computer game, Companions of Xanth, the player assumes the role of Dug. Plot summary Dug, a Mundane, is transported in to the magic land of Xanth when he plays a computer game introduced to him by his friend for a bet. The game consists of the player having a companion, who is usually a well known Xanth character, and being led through the magical world of Xanth, defeating challenges along the way and eventually winning the ultimate prize of a magic talent. The catch with the companions is that there is a chance that your companion is false, meaning that at the point where you might finally win, the companion will cause your ultimate downfall. The game also has a way of becoming 3D to the player, and, if the player believes in magic, eventually real. Dug, being a mundane boy of sixteen, picks Nada Naga as his partner, because of her beauty. Nada Naga begins to lead Dug in the world of Xanth, at first trying to convince him that the magical world is real, but giving up after realizing that Dug stubbornly refuses to believe in magic. Dug travels to the Isthmus village, where he learns the town is being controlled under a horrible censorship. He sets out to destroy the ship. After defeating the censorship, he is kicked out of the game twice, once only temporarily from trying to look at Nada's panties, the second time for good after being defeated by Com Pewter. He comes back to the game and picks Nada to be his partner again but fails to remember that there is a chance that Nada will be a False Companion, which she is. He again has to go through the first part of his adventure, but this time his starting point has changed to the Black Village, home to the new Black Wave. Sherlock, one of the members of the Black Wave, joins Nada and Dug on their journey. Later in Xanth he meets Kim, another Mundane playing the game. Kim is with Bubbles--a dog she found in a bubble--Sammy Cat, and Jenny Elf (her companion). While Dug was completing the first part of his adventure, Kim was having her own. She first was captured by ogres and had to play a mind game with them in order to escape. She then traveled to the Water Wing, where her and Jenny met Cyrus Merman, who is trying to find a wife. He accompanies them on their journey in hopes of finding a wife on the way. When Kim and Dug meet, Kim develops a crush on Dug, but at first Dug does not return the feeling. The two parties attempt to cross the Gap Chasm, but split up, after Dug and Kim decide to switch companions. Kim, Nada, Cyrus, and Bubbles go toward the ocean where Cyrus ends up meeting the merwoman who ends up being his wife, Merci Merwoman, Mela's daughter.

Baker is best known for having been Government House Leader during the short-lived minority government of Joe Clark. He received much of the popular blame for the defeat of the government in a Motion of no confidence on December 13, 1979 with the claim that the government fell because \\"Walter Baker couldn't count\\". However, observers pointed out that targeting Baker as the scapegoat was unfair as he was House Leader, not Party Whip. The defeat was the result of the Clark government's decision to alienate the six Social Credit Members of Parliament by refusing to accord them official party status as well as Clark's view that he could \\"govern as if\\" he had a majority government. Baker was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1972 election as the Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament for Grenville‚ÄîCarleton (later renamed Nepean‚ÄîCarleton) and was re-elected in the 1974, 1979 and 1980 elections. He served as both Government House Leader and Minister of National Revenue during the Clark government. He served as Opposition House Leader from 1976 to 1979 and again from 1980 to 1981. In government, Baker introduced the first ever Access to Information Bill which died on the order paper with the Tory government. However, much of Baker's bill became part of the eventual Access to Information Act that was introduced by Liberal Solicitor-General Francis Fox in 1983 and passed by parliament into law. He was one of the founding partners of the law firm Bell Baker LLP located in Ottawa, Ontario.

Zulu is New Orleans' largest predominantly African American carnival organization known for its blackfaced krewe members wearing grass skirts and its unique throw of hand-painted coconuts. The club is a regular feature of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. History In 1908, John L. Metoyer and members of a New York mutual aid society called \\"The Tramps\\" attended a vaudevillian comedy show called There Never Was and Never Will Be a King Like Me. The musical comedy performed by the \\"Smart Set\\" at the Pythian Temple Theater on the corner of Gravier and Saratoga in New Orleans included a skit where the characters wore grass skirts and dressed in black makeup. Metoyer became inspired by the skit and reorganized his marching troupe from baggy- pant-wearing tramps to a new group called the \\"Zulus\\". In 1909, Metoyer and the first Zulu king, William Story, wore a lard-can crown and carried a banana stalk as a scepter. Six years later in 1915, the first decorated platform was constructed with dry goods boxes on a spring wagon. The King's float was decorated with tree moss and palmetto leaves. In 1916, Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club became incorporated where the organization's bylaws were established as well as its social mission and dedication to benevolence and goodwill. In 1933, the Lady Zulu Auxiliary was formed by the wives of Zulu members, and in 1948 Edwina Robertson became the first Queen of Zulu, making the club the first to feature a queen in a parade. In the 1960s, membership dwindled as a result of social pressures from civil rights activists. The protesters advertised in the local black community's newspaper The Louisiana Weekly stating: According to the club, Zulu's use of black makeup was never a form of \\"blackface\\". Throughout the south, black Americans were prohibited from wearing masks, but black makeup was permitted. The Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club, Inc. says that it has and never will participate in the act of \\"blackface,\\" as \\"blackface\\" is the derogatory, hateful representation of black people as buffoons and idiots.https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/16/us/zulu-new- orleans-blackface/index.html During the 1960s, the organization, with the support of the Mayor and chief-of-police, gave up black make up but continued the tradition of the parade, wearing grass skirts and keeping the identity of the king secret. Due to continued pressure, by 1965 there were only 15 Zulu members remaining. The induction of local civil rights leaders Ernest J. Wright and Morris F.X. Jeff Sr. as Zulu members eventually lifted tensions and membership started to increase. The krewe soon resumed their old traditions, including the black makeup. Unlike the other \\"old-line\\" Carnival Krewes, Zulu never had a policy of racial discrimination. From its inception, any man, regardless of race, ethnicity or religion, had the opportunity to join the membership. In 1973, Roy E. \\"Glap\\" Glapion Jr., Zulu President from 1973‚Äì1988, started actively recruiting professionals, educators, and prominent businessmen and men from all racial and ethnic backgrounds to join Zulu's membership, making Zulu the first parading organization to actually parade racially integrated. Zulu coconut The Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club is well known to parade-goers for throwing coconuts to the crowd.Deja Krewe. The Times-Picayune. Retrieved October 31, 2011. In the early 20th century, other parading organizations threw glass necklaces, often hand-made and expensive. The working men of Zulu could not afford similar throws, and decided to purchase coconuts from the French Market since they were unusual and relatively cheap. Painted and adorned coconuts became popular with the club starting in the late 1940s. In 1987, the organization was unable to renew its insurance coverage, and lawsuits stemming from coconut-related injuries forced a halt to the tradition. In 1988 Governor Edwin W. Edwards signed Louisiana State Bill #SB188, the \\"Coconut Bill\\", into law, removing liability from injuries resulting from coconuts and enabling the tradition to resume. Current Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club President : Elroy James (Zulu Notable Characters) Zulu King Zulu Big Shot Zulu Witch Doctor Zulu Ambassador Zulu Mayor Zulu Province Prince Zulu Governor Zulu Mr. Big Stuff King of Zulu Zulu is the only New Orleans Mardi Gras krewe that selects their king through an election voting process. Potential kings must campaign for the job, including throwing parties for other krewe members to solicit votes. Kings of Zulu=Queen of Zulu In 1948 Edwina Robertson became the first Queen of Zulu, making the club the first to feature a queen in a parade. It is a tradition for the club to make a show of meeting the Zulu queen at the airport, but most years' Zulu queens live in New Orleans and therefore have to travel elsewhere so that they can make the flight into the airport for the ceremony.

The network is owned by Plural TV, which is a joint venture of the El Comercio and La Rep√∫blica daily newspapers. It was the second television channel to be founded in Peru, the first commercial station with regular broadcasts, and Peru's highest-rated network. History=Origins The origins of Am√©rica Televisi√≥n reach back to 1942, with the formation of the first privately backed radio network in Peru, Compa√±√≠a Peruana de Radiodifusi√≥n, S.A. (Peruvian Radio Company). Among the original stations was Radio Am√©rica 94.3, which would eventually be owned by Antonio Umbert and Nicanor Gonz√°lez V√°squez. In early 1955, Umbert and Gonz√°lez received a license to broadcast on television channel 4, and using RCA equipment from the United States and after intense work to construct the facilities, Radio Am√©rica TV, callsign OAY-4D, began transmissions on Monday, December 15, 1958, at 18:15. Attending the first broadcast was then-Peruvian president Manuel Prado Ugarteche. Among the early programs were the first live broadcast, a football match from the Estadio Nacional de Lima, and the first fiction program on Peruvian television, Bar Cristal, which debuted in 1959. In the 1960s, Arturo Pomar became the anchor of Am√©rica's news programs. The 1970s: World Cups and nationalization The 1970s for channel 4 in Lima were a turbulent time. While the station carried both the 1970 and 1978 World Cups, in which the Peruvian national team was highly competitive, and the station added a news program in Quechua in the early 1970s (before its revival as an official language of the country), a major change came about when the military government of the time expropriated 51% of the shares in the station. Juan Velasco Alvarado's government created the state company Telecentro, which took over management of then C4 Television (renamed Am√©rica in 1978) and its chief rival, Panamericana Televisi√≥n. The 1970s also saw an introduction of color telecasts, in time for the 1978 World Cup, which was seen in color in Lima and some provinces, such as Tacna. In 1980, with the end of the military dictatorship, Telecentro was abolished. One of the best dramas of the decade was 1972's El Adorable Profesor Aldao, which catapulted Yola Polastri to stardom. The 1980s In the 1980s, Am√©rica continued its success. Programs like El Chavo del Ocho and other animated imports‚ÄîThunderCats, My Little Pony and He-Man among them‚Äîwere major ratings winners, while Tulio Loza and Pablo de Madalengoitia became popular personalities. Its coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics from Seoul included every game of the Peruvian women's volleyball team, which achieved a silver-medal finish. In 1988, to celebrate its 30th anniversary, the channel inaugurated a new studio facility known as \\"Est√∫dio 4\\". The 1990s: Crousillat and Televisa In 1992, the Mexican network Televisa acquired a significant stake in Am√©rica, and two years later, businessman Jos√© Enrique Crousillat, who had close ties to the Azcarraga family of Televisa, became administrator of the station. Under Crousillat and Televisa, Mexican-produced telenovelas came to dominate the schedule. Among the strong suits of Am√©rica in this area was a continued good run of imported animated shows, with Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon and Samurai Cats airing on the channel at this time, and Laura en Am√©rica (1998‚Äì2001), a talk show hosted by Laura Bozzo that was popular on the international market. Pomar died in 1993, leaving a new generation of journalists and expanded news programs; it was at this time that Am√©rica added a morning newscast, Primera Edici√≥n (First Edition). 2001‚Äì2002: Political scandal in Peru, turmoil at Am√©rica Political scandal rocked Per√∫ in 2000 with the discovery of the \\"Vladivideos\\", triggering a corruption scandal involving Vladimiro Montesinos, who was found to have bribed important business and political leaders, including the Crousillats. The scandal brought down Alberto Fujimori's administration and also was a black mark to Am√©rica Televisi√≥n. In 2001, Crousillat's daughters took over the network, and at the same time, Am√©rica fell from first to third in the ratings. Debts mounted, and creditors took over after a declaration of insolvency in late 2001 and the end of Crousillat's management in April 2002. 2003‚Äìpresent: Plural TV and a return to the top Logo used since 2003 until June 6, 2016, a date that makes a makeover. In 2003, Plural TV bought the debt of Am√©rica's creditors and took over the channel, injecting funds into it and hoping to resurrect its ratings leadership. Eric Jurgensen took over in management. The moves paid off, as beginning in 2004, Am√©rica siphoned key personalities and programs from Panamericana, helping it to return to its traditional first place in the ratings. In 2009, Am√©rica began testing high- definition and 1seg telecasts using the Japanese-Brazilian ISDB-T system, first on UHF channel 31, then on its assigned UHF channel 24, with 1seg service beginning in April 2010. High-definition programming began in 2011. In 2012, Crousillat announced that he would sell his remaining stake in the channel to the Peruvian state. It also continued broadcasting the Olympic Games to Per√∫, with coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics from London. In 2013, Am√©rica launched a new digital service, Fusi√≥n Gourmet, a network specializing in food. It is Am√©rica's second cable network; in 2012, it bought Canal N, an all-news channel started in 1999. Currently, Am√©rica is the ratings leader in Per√∫, with a 36% share of the national audience. It produces 65% of the shows it airs, and most of its imports still come from Televisa, with which it has retained a business relationship.

The Dastard is a vile, loathsome man with the power to travel back in time. He uses this to neutralize people's joyous moments and if this includes removing the existence of sentient beings, so be it. Despite this selfish, amoral attitude, The Dastard finds himself involved with a cross-Xanth adventure anyway, with a woman resistant to his methods. He runs up against the Sea Hag, who is equally as evil and powerful. Plot summary Becka was a crossbreed - the daughter of Draco Dragon and a lovely human woman who met, by chance, at a Love Spring. Now fourteen, Becka was beginning to wonder where in Xanth she belonged, on the ground with her mother's people or flying the skies with her father's kind. So she journeyed to the Good Magician Humfrey to discover her true purpose in life. Much to her astonishment and surprise, the Magician told her that a great Destiny awaited her, one that would affect the future of all of Xanth. To unravel the mystery of her Fate, Becka did as Humfrey bade her: traveling on foot to the statue of the dreaded Sea Hag to meet the man who would be waiting for her there, and offering him her assistance. But to her dismay, Becka discovered that the one who awaited her there was a dangerous, despicable libertine who called himself the Dastard. Once a common country boy, the Dastard had sold his soul to a detestable demon in exchange for the power to erase events and rewrite history to suit his own devious ends. Lacking a conscience and filled with craven self-loathing, he roamed the width and breadth of Xanth in search of anyone happier than he was. Once he found them, he used his malevolent talent to \\"unhappen\\" their happiness so that others could share in his misery. Determined to honor her vow but despairing of her ability to help this man and still preserve her virtue, Becka set out on a wide and perilous journey that led from the mists of Xanth's distant past to the tiny planetoid of Ptero, where everyone in Xanth who might have been actually existed. There she discovered a magic that was far stronger than the Dastard's: the awesome power of the human heart. Characters  *The Dastard - An evil man, only concerned with his base, animalistic desires. Once a man named Anomy, with the talent of Stupid Ideas, he traded his soul to a demon for the talent of Unhappening events.

Plot summary Clio, the Muse of History, discovers the twenty-eighth volume of Xanth, but she cannot read it and does not remember writing it. She goes to consult with the Good Magician, who treats her as a Querent. His Answer is that she should look for the currant, and her Service is to restock the extinct dragon population of Xanth. To this end she needs to recruit dragons from one of Ida‚Äôs moons. He also gives her a magical compass that will direct her toward her objective. Clio uses the service of Becka, the dragon girl from Castle Maidragon to escort her safely among the dragons. She also uses Che Centaur to prepare organic material, mainly peat, to form bodies for the dragon spirits. She finds the dragon moon of Ida recruits with the help of Drew and Drusie, two tiny telepathic dragons, whose relationship is forbidden. With the help of Dragon‚Äôs Ida, a dragon herself, she uses the Dragon-net to bring the recruited dragon souls back to Xanth. Back in Xanth, Clio follows the directives of the magical compass and performs various tasks all over Xanth. She encounters Sherlock, a man from the Black Wave, banished from his village after a series of odd accidents. It turns out that after a decade in Xanth, Sherlock developed a magical talent ‚Äì to summon and control reverse wood.

She also meets Umlaut and Surprise Golem, stranded in the Water Zone when rescuing Ciriana - a five year old girl whose talent is immunity to the Adult Conspiracy. In Castle Zombie Clio meets Thesis, who holds a magical device called The Spancel. She reveals that it was created by the Mundane Sorceress Morgan le Fay, who now resides in Ptero. Clio goes back to Ptero, to return the Spancel, where she is forced to confront the sorceress. She prevails with the aid of Sherlock, who saves her from the sorceress and from Demon Lithosphere. Finally, they return to Mount Parnassus, where they discover the currant plant in the garden. They revive the plant with the various artifacts retrieved during the quest, and take the big currant it grows. They discover that the twenty eighth volume was replaced with Humfrey's Book of Answers. After Sherlock uses his powers to switch the books back, they use the juice to decipher the text of the book. Back in Mount Parnassus Clio finally realizes that Sherlock‚Äôs talent is magician level, making him eligible to marry her. Only after Drew and Drusie intervene is she able to tell him that she loves him back. They adopt Ciriana and decide to live in normal Xanth. Finally, Clio realizes that her whole adventure had been another Demon bet, and verifies it with Venus who acknowledges the fact. Dragon Dragon is one of Ida‚Äôs moons. It is shaped as an Orbros, and unlike other moons it seems to be sentient. Dragon Ida, living on the tip of the tail, says that it is the source of all dragons. The dragons of the moon are arranged in five categories - environment, weapon, size, nature, and mental nature. There are five aspects for each category, making a total of 3,125 permutations, each considered a dragon type.

Debra Kawaguchi was a huge fan of the Xanth series and after her death in 2004, her father wrote Piers and asked him to include Debra in his cast of characters. After Piers explained to Debra's father that the only way he could think to include Debra in the book was through the De-Bra-ing pun, Mr. Kawaguchi agreed that Debra would have been delighted to be a character in Xanth and would have loved the pun.

The square is bordered by West Hastings Street to the northeast, West Pender Street to the southwest, Cambie Street to the southeast, and Hamilton Street to the northwest. The term is also used to refer to the neighbourhood immediately surrounding the square. History Victory Square was at one time the grounds of the city's provincial courthouse, which was torn down in 1911‚Äì13 when the new Francis Rattenbury-designed courthouse on Georgia Street was opened (now the Vancouver Art Gallery). The location had significance when it was chosen, as it stands at the intersection of the old Granville townsite (aka Gastown) and the CPR Townsite, which was the downtown-designated land grant obtained by the CPR as part of the deal to locate the terminus and thereby found the city (the corner of Hastings and Hamilton is the northern tip of the CPR Townsite). An area of out of the allotted to the CPR was held aside as \\"Government Square\\" on February 13, 1886. The southwest corner of Hamilton and Hastings Streets is where L. A. Hamilton drove the first survey stake to commence laying out the street system for the city. The Victory Square Cenotaph was unveiled on 27 April 1924 Boyd & Clendenning were contracted by the CPR to begin felling the forest at a rate of $26 per acre and an extra $2 per acre for lopping off large branches. A tangled mass soon built up to thick that was to be the kindling for the great fire that leveled the townsite.60 Years! Vancouver's Diamond Jubilee, Official Souvenir, 1946, 34‚Äì35. It was down the park's hillside that the clearing crews of the CPR entered Gastown a few steps ahead of the firestorm that destroyed the city on June 13, 1886, heading for their quarters in the Regina Hotel at Cambie and Water where they had themselves stored water and wetted blankets as safety precaution (it was the only building in that part of the city to survive the fire). Until that year, however, the site of Victory Square as with all of the downtown peninsula outside of Gastown had been dense west coast rainforest, with trees standing in dark, thick groves hundreds of feet high and also a small creek (now vanished). During the old courthouse's tenure the vicinity was the hub of the city's financial and legal district, with the Vancouver curb exchange operating just across Hastings Street, mostly in a passageway cutting the corner diagonally behind the Astor Hotel (see photos in External links). The Inns of Court, a ramshackle and infamously leaky (if decorative) structure on the west side of Courthouse Square, was the location of adjutant legal services and offices connected to the Court House. The Oddfellows Hall and what is now the Army, Navy and Air Force Veterans Hall still stand further south (uphill) along Hamilton Street from where the Inns of Court used to be (now a modernist bank-cum-film studio). Most of the original main branches of the major banks were within the next few blocks west along Hastings, which in both directions was the hub of the city's shopping district until the completion of Pacific Centre in the 1970s, which severed the old pedestrian link between Woodward's, a block east of Victory Square, and Eaton's, two blocks west (now the SFU Harbour Centre campus). On the south side of Victory Square originally stood the Central School, which later became the original Vancouver Community College (then named Vancouver College), adjacent to which was the city's original main hospital (both were in a brickwork Gothic style). Completed in 1910, the Dominion Building is one of several historic buildings adjacent to Victory Square. Even once it was known that the courthouse was to be demolished, major construction continued to line the square where it had been. The Province, Sun and Dominion Buildings went up in rapid succession in the last years of the courthouse's existence, and remain today, although no longer as newspaper buildings. The maple trees on the Pender Street side of the park are the oldest street trees in the city, planted in 1897. Vancouver Park Board, \\"Street Trees\\" Victory Square Cenotaph A Canadian Forces and RCMP guard of honour at the Remembrance Day services on Victory Square, 12 November 2014. On the northern side of the square, on a plaza flanking Hastings Street, lies the Vancouver war memorial, the Victory Square Cenotaph. The cenotaph is approximately tall, and is a triangular edifice whose shape conforms to that of the square. The pillar is of Nelson Island granite engraved with suitable inscriptions, and is kept continuously banked high with wreaths of flowers and adorned with national flags. The cenotaph was unveiled by William Reid Owen, Mayor of Vancouver, in the presence of an assemblage of 25,000 persons; naval, military and civilian, and including the Old Contemptibles, 7th British Columbia, 29th Vancouver, 72nd Seaforths, 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles, 47th New Westminster, and 102nd North British Columbian Battalions, CEF, and others, on 27 April 1924. It was dedicated by Major Cecil C. Owen, chaplain of the 29th (Vancouver) Battalion, CEF. The 24th Psalm was read by Lieutenant-Colonel G.O. Fallis, of the Methodist Church, and the music included \\"O Canada\\" (Buchan); \\"O God, Our Help in Ages Past\\"; \\"Lochaber No More\\" (bagpipes); \\"For All the Saints\\"; \\"Last Post\\" and \\"God Save the King\\". The first wreath, being the tribute of the Corporation and Citizens of Vancouver, was placed by W.R. Owen, wife of the mayor. Victory Square Cenotaph is located on the northern side of the square. The ornamentations on the stone include one long sword and two wreaths, one of laurels, the other of poppies; both entwined with maple leaves. A stone replica of the steel helmet, as used in the war of 1914‚Äì1918, adorns three corner buttresses. A larger wreath of laurels surrounds the numerals \\"1914‚Äì1918\\" at the base of the front. Slots in a receptacle of three bronze maple leaves hold the staffs of the Union Jack, the Canadian Red Ensign, the Flag of Canada, the White Ensign, and RCAF Ensign, always flying, which are placed there by the Royal Canadian Legion and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League, and renewed four times each year. Of the monument faces; one side faces Hastings Street, the others Pender and Hamilton Streets, and was designed thus by Major G.L. Thornton Sharp, architect, town planner, and park commissioner, to conform to the triangular shape of the park. It is so placed that, when approached from the east, it appears in the distance centrally at the end of busy Hastings Street. The granite was supplied by the Vancouver Granite Co., Ltd., and the erecting contractors were Stewart and Wylie. Stewart died from the effects of an accident whilst preparing the memorial. The Vancouver War Memorial Committee of 24, of which 12 represented the Canadian Club of Vancouver, and 12 the Civic War Memorial Committee, the whole under the chairmanship of F.W. Rounsefell, pioneer, and with J.R.V. Dunlop, of the Canadian Club, as honorary secretary, were the public-spirited sponsors. The cenotaph cost $10,666. The engraved inscriptions are: Facing Hastings Street: \\"Their name liveth for evermore\\" and, within a stone wreath, \\"1914‚Äì1918\\". Facing Hamilton Street: \\"Is it nothing to you\\". Facing Pender Street: \\"All ye that pass by\\". The first, commencing \\"Their name\\", is from Sirach, Chapter 44, Verse 14. The second, commencing \\"Is it nothing\\", from Lamentations, Chapter 1, Verse 12. The third side represents the continuation of the verse from Lamentations. In his valedictory address, Major Owen said: \\"Those whose sacrifices this Cenotaph commemorates, were among the men who, at call of King and Country, left all that was dear, endured hardship, faced danger, and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty, giving their own lives that others might live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that their names be not forgotten.\\" The Cenotaph continues to be the focus of the city's annual Remembrance Day services. The site of the Cenotaph is significant because it was at tables at the foot of the old courthouse steps where men signed up for the First World War in 1914‚Äîwhich was symbolic for the enlistees because of the strong royalist sentiment in the city, as it was on the courthouse steps where the main ceremonials of the various royal visits to Vancouver had taken place. The courthouse was the location of many official ceremonies, particularly the royal visits of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 and the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn in 1912.

The designation means it had a caliber of 75 mm, the barrel was 46 caliber-lengths long and it was accepted in service in 1934.  History  Showing the influence of contemporary Vickers designs, it was a sound and orthodox design; however, its production was first late in starting and slow in being carried out (by 1942, of the 240 ordered only 226 had been delivered). This meant that older and obsolete AA guns had to be kept in service even though their efficacy was minimal, and also that its production was parallel to the newer and better performing Cannone da 90/53. In addition to the mobile modello 34 a static mount the Cannone da 75/46 C.A. modello 40 was produced. Once again production was slow and only 45 of the 240 ordered were delivered. Assigned both to field units and to battieres protecting the Italian territory, it was also used on the Eastern front and in the Tunisian Campaign as an anti-tank gun (in which capacity it was also fitted to the Semovente da 75/46 self-propelled gun). Its performance was considered good in both roles, especially in the latter, with its AP shell that could pierce of armor at ), but it was never available in numbers. After the Italian Armistice, the Wehrmacht captured some of these guns, and employed them with the designation 7.5 cm Flak 264/3(i), while modello 40 guns were given the designation 7.5 cm Flak 264/4(i)  See also  * Italian Army equipment in World War II * Cannone da 90/53 - another contemporary Italian anti-aircraft gun  References  * Artillery by Chris Chant, published by Amber Books, * The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Barnes and Noble Ltd.

In September 1563, he was invited by Cosimo I, Duke of Tuscany to participate in his cosmographical project, the Guardaroba in the Palazzo Vecchio. Over the next dozen years, Danti painted 30 maps of regions of the world (based largely upon published prints by Giacomo Gastaldi, Abraham Ortelius, Gerardus Mercator, and others) upon the cabinet doors of the Guardaroba. He also worked on many other significant scientific and cosmographic projects in Florence, including the large terrestrial globe of the Guardaroba (1564‚Äì1568), and a number of brass scientific instruments (such as an astrolabe) today in the Museo Galileo in Florence. Between 1567 and 1569, Pius V, who belonged to the Dominicans, is said to have commissioned Danti to furnish plans for the construction of a Dominican church and convent at Bosco Marengo in Piedmont; Danti acted mainly as an adviser. During his stay in Florence, Danti taught mathematics and published a number of scientific treatises, mostly commentaries on ancient and medieval astronomy and mathematics or explanations of how to use scientific instruments. For much of his time in Florence, Danti resided at the convent of Santa Maria Novella, and designed the quadrant and the armillary sphere that appear on the end blind arches of the lower facade of the church in 1572 and 1574, on the right and left respectively. He also designed a large-scale gnomon for the church which allowed a thin beam of light to enter the church at noon each day through a hole just beneath the facade's rose window, although it probably was not completed by the time Danti left Florence. There were also discussions between the Duke and Danti about building a canal to place Florence in communication with both the Mediterranean and the Adriatic. However, this ambitious plan was not started before Cosimo's death in 1574. In late September the following year, Cosimo's son, Grand Duke Francesco de' Medici, forced Danti to leave Florence on an uncertain morals charge. It is not known precisely why Francesco exiled Danti, but the Dominican had no trouble finding work or patrons anywhere else in Italy, although he never returned to Florence. Later life and bishopric After leaving Florence, Danti became professor of mathematics at the University of Bologna. While there he built a massive gnomon in the Bolognese church of San Petronio, the meridian line of which is still visible in the church's pavement. He also spent some time in Perugia, at the invitation of the governor, where he prepared maps of the Perugian republic. Italy, Corsica and Sardinia - Gallery of Maps - Vatican Museums On account of his mathematical skills, Pope Gregory XIII invited him to Rome, appointed him pontifical mathematician and made him a member of the commission for the reform of the calendar. He also placed him in charge of the painters whom the Pope had summoned to the Vatican to continue the decoration of the palace, most notably to make a number of maps of the regions of modern Italy in the newly constructed Gallery of Maps along the Cortile del Belvedere. This project, begun in early 1580 and completed about 18 months later, mapped the entirety of the Italian peninsula in 40 large-scale frescoes, each depicting a region as well as a perspective view of its most prominent city. When the pontiff commissioned the architect Domenico Fontana to repair the Claudian harbour it was Danti who furnished the necessary plans. While at Rome Danti published a translation of a portion of Euclid with annotations and wrote a life of the architect Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola, preparing also notes for the latter's work on perspective. In 1583, in recognition of his work, Gregory made him Bishop of Alatri in the Campagna. He was appointed on 14 November 1583, and consecrated as bishop on 30 November 1583 by Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti de Nuce, Patriarch of Jerusalem. with Giovanni Battista Santorio, Bishop of Alife, and Gerolamo Mazzarelli, Bishop of Nona, serving as co-consecrators. Danti showed himself a zealous pastor in his new office. As Bishop of Alatri, Danti convoked a diocesan synod, corrected many abuses, and showed great solicitude for the poor. While bishop, he was the principal co-consecrator of Marco Pedacca, Bishop of Lacedonia (1584); and Basilio Gradi, Bishop of Stagno (1584). Shortly before his death Pope Sixtus V summoned him to Rome to assist in the erection of the grand obelisk in the piazza of the Vatican. Besides the works already mentioned, Danti was the author of Trattato del'uso e della fabbrica dell'astrolabo con la giunta del planifero del Raja; Le Scienze matematiche ridotte in tavole, also a revised and annotated edition of La Sfera di Messer G. Sacrobosco tradotta da Pier Vincenzio Danti. The first mentioned work deals with the use and construction of the astrolabe and is one of the oldest instructions for scientific instruments. Danti wrote the first Italian treatise on this topic to accompany the book.Ralf Kern, Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit, Vol. 1, Cologne: Koenig, 2010, p. 318. Danti died at Alatri on 10 October 1586, three years into his service. In 1588, Giovanni Antonio Magini was chosen to occupy the chair of mathematics at the University of Bologna, over Galileo.

History From 1783 onwards, there was a systematic settlement of Russians, Ukrainians, and Germans to the Crimean Peninsula (in what was then the Crimean Khanate) in order to weaken the Crimean Tatar population. The first planned settlements of Germans in Crimea were founded over 1805-1810 with the support of Czar Alexander I. The first settlements were: Friedental - in the district of Simferopol; formed in 1806 by Lutherans Heilbrunn - in the district of Feodosiya; formed in 1809 by Lutherans Kronental - in the district of Simferopol; formed in 1810 by Lutherans and Catholics Neusatz - in the district of Simferopol; formed in 1806 by Lutherans Rosental - in the district of Simferopol; formed in 1806 by Catholics Staryj Krim (old Crimea)- in the district Feodosiya; formed in 1805 by Lutherans and Catholics Sudak - in the district of Feodosiya; formed in 1805 by Lutherans Zuerichtal - in the district of Feodosiya; formed in 1805 by Swiss and Lutherans All of these early colonies were located in the Yayla- mountains of Crimea and were mostly Swabian wine-farmers. However over time only Sudak produced quality wine and the other settlements soon turned to agriculture. The second generation didn‚Äôt have enough land and soon young men started buying land from the Russian aristocracy and creating new (\\"daughter\\") colonies. German map of Crimea, Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 1888. Later Mennonites began to move from Ukraine into Crimea. Details are vague but during the 19th century a \\"German hospital\\" and dispensary arose in the Simferopol suburb of Nowyj gorod (called Neustadt or new city - now this is \\"–ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω\\" of Simferopol).\\"Die deutschen Kolonien in der Krim\\" in the Heimutbuch der Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Russland (1960) Soviet Persecution Portion of German settled population in Crimea in 1926 In red indicated German national districts in the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic On 18 October 1921 the so-called Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created as part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (i.e. part of Russia). In place of today Krasnohvardiiske Raion there were created two national districts for Germans Biyuk-Onlar and Telman. Under the Soviet regime many Volksdeutsche were persecuted by gangs of Russian peasants as landowning Kulaks or class enemy bourgeoisie. In 1939, two years before their deportation to Central Asia, around 60,000 of the 1.1 million inhabitants of Crimea were German and \\"they had their own administrative raion in the Crimean Republic.\\".Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries: the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German minorities of Europe, 1939-1945 (1993), page.128. Exiles dispersed all over the world. In Canada, Reynold Rapp, a farmer and Lutheran immigrant from the Crimea, became a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament. A strong supporter of the British heritage of freedom in his adoptive country, Rapp opposed the replacement of the Canadian Red Ensign with a new Maple leaf flag in 1964. He told reporters: \\"I may be the only man in this House who has lived under the Hammer & Sickle. A flag is not just a bunting: it represents so much more than that.\\"The Globe and Mail, October 3, 1964 Nazi invasion, deportation and exile In late 1941, following the Axis invasion of the western regions of the USSR, Soviet authorities forcibly removed almost 53,000 native Germans of Crimea eastwards to Siberia and Central Asia on entirely spurious allegations that they were spies for the Third Reich. Consequently, many died in transit, although later they could not be seriously blamed for Nazi crimes in the region. > \\"Stalin had no doubts about the loyalty of the ethnic German minority.

Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries: the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle and the German minorities of Europe, 1939-1945 (1993), page 250. The Nazi Generalkommissar for Crimea, the Austrian Alfred Frauenfeld, toyed with the idea of resettling ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) here from Italian South Tyrol after the war, and several cities of the envisaged Gotengau were renamed with spurious German names (Simferopol became Gotenburg and Sevastopol became Theodorichhafen for example).

The German reunification brought a rebirth of Crimean-German culture and, in 1994, had a small representation in the Crimean Parliament. The 1991 RSFSR law On the Rehabilitation of Repressed Peoples addressed rehabilitation of all ethnicities repressed in the Soviet Union. However the law had various deficiencies, including unclear legal status of a number of peoples, such as Crimean Tatars and Crimean Germans moved across the borders of Soviet republics, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.–ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ–≤—ã–µ –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã —Ä–µ–∞–±–∏–ª–∏—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Ä–µ–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤, in Pravo i Zhizn, 1994, no 4, p. 26.

The game recreates the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC between the Macedonians and the Persians. Players choose to portray either Alexander the Great or King Darius III. The game uses small cardboard counters and a hex-based movement system common to wargames of this era. Pieces represent infantry, cavalry, phalanx formations, chariots, and elephants. A unique feature of the game is a sliding morale track to determine which combat results table is used for combat resolution.

Unlike functionalist theories and some rational choice approaches, historical institutionalism tends to emphasize that many outcomes are possible, small events and flukes can have large consequences, actions are hard to reverse once they take place, and that outcomes may be inefficient. So-called \\"critical junctures\\" may set in motion events that are hard to reverse, because of issues related to path dependency. Historical institutionalists tend to focus on history (longer temporal horizons) to understand why specific events happen. The term \\"Historical Institutionalism\\" was coined in the early 1990s. The most widely cited historical institutionalist scholars are Peter Hall, Paul Pierson, Theda Skocpol, Douglass North and Kathleen Thelen. Prominent works of historical institutionalist scholarship have used both sociological and rationalist methods. Historical institutionalist works tend to employ detailed comparative case studies. Works, such as Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation, Theda Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions, Philippe Schmitter's Still a Century of Corporatism?, Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, and Evans, Ruschemeyer and Skocpol's Bringing the State Back In have been characterized as precursors to Historical Institutionalism. Old and new institutionalism Kathleen Thelen and Sven Steinmo contrast New Institutionalism with \\"Old Institutionalism\\", which was overwhelmingly focused on detailed narratives of institutions, with little focus on comparative analyses. Thus, the Old Institutionalism was unhelpful for comparative research and explanatory theory. This \\"Old Institutionalism\\" began to be undermined when scholars increasingly highlighted how the formal rules and administrative structures of institutions were not accurately describing the behavior of actors and policy outcomes. Works, such as Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation, Theda Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions, Philippe Schmitter's Still a Century of Corporatism?, Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, and Evans, Ruschemeyer and Skocpol's Bringing the State Back In have been characterized as precursors to Historical Institutionalism, spawning a new research program. Historical institutionalism is a predominant approach in research on the welfare state. In the field of International Relations, John Ikenberry‚Äôs After Victory and Abraham Newman‚Äôs Protectors of Privacy are prominent works of historical institutionalist scholarship. The treatment of history Unlike most western scholars who preceded them, including classical liberals, classical Marxists, empiricists, dialectical thinkers and positivists, historical institutionalists do not accept that history necessarily develops in a straightforward, linear fashion. Instead, they examine the conditions under which a particular trajectory was followed and not others, a phenomenon that Gabriel Almond refers to as the \\"historical cure\\".. As a consequence, specifying why particular paths were not taken is as important as specifying the actual trajectory of history. As opposed to the old institutionalists, they postulate that history will not necessarily lead to a \\"happy\\" outcome (i.e. \\"fascism or democracy as the end of history\\"). The most basic concept with which historical institutionalists work is the concept of path dependence. For Paul Pierson, path dependence entails that ‚Äúoutcomes at a ‚Äòcritical juncture‚Äô trigger feedback mechanisms [negative or positive] that reinforce the recurrence of a particular pattern into the future.‚Äù Thus, path dependence makes it harder to reverse once a certain path has been taken, because there are increased costs to switching from the path. These paths may lead to outcomes are inefficient, but nonetheless persist, because of the costs involved in making substantial overhauls. An example of this is the QWERTY keyboard layout, which was efficient for typewriters to prevent jams in the 19th century and was implemented in computer keyboards in the 20th century. However, the QWERTY keyboard is arguably not as efficient as a computer keyboard could be, but the keyboard layout has persisted over time due to the costs involved in overhauling computer keyboards. Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson argue that other approaches to institutions may fall guilty of treating politics as if it were the film Groundhog Day where each day the participants just start over; in reality, past politics and policy legacies shape the interests, incentivizes, power and organizational abilities of political actors. A related crux of historical institutionalism is that temporal sequences matter: outcomes depend upon the timing of exogenous factors (such as inter-state competition or economic crisis) in relation to particular institutional configurations (such as the level of bureaucratic professionalism or degree of state autonomy from class forces). For example, Theda Skocpol suggests that the democratic outcome of the English Civil War was a result of the fact that the comparatively weak English Crown lacked the military capacity to fight the landed upper-class. In contrast, the rise of rapid industrialization and fascism in Prussia when faced with international security threats was because the Prussian state was a ‚Äúhighly bureaucratic and centralized agrarian state‚Äù composed by ‚Äúmen closely ties to landed notables‚Äù.. Thomas Ertman, in his account of state building in medieval and early modern Europe, argues that variations in the type of regime built in Europe during this period can be traced to one macro-international factor and two historical institutional factors. At the macro-structural level, the ‚Äútiming of the onset of sustained geopolitical competition‚Äù created an atmosphere of insecurity that appeared best addressed by consolidating state power. The timing of the onset of competition is critical for Ertman‚Äôs explanation. States that faced competitive pressures early had to consolidate through patrimonial structures, since the development of modern bureaucratic techniques had not yet arrived. States faced with competitive pressures later could on the other hand, could take advantage of advancements in training and knowledge to promote a more technical oriented civil service..Whitehead, Richard (2002, October). ‚ÄúIn Debate: The Casual Focus of Historical Institutionalism‚Äù. Paper presented at Temple University course seminar on Authoritarian Regimes, Philadelphia, PA. An important element to historical institutionalism is that it may cement certain distributions of power or increase asymmetries of power through policy feedbacks, \\"lock in\\" effects and stickiness. For example, France has a permanent seat on the UN Security Council because of its power and status at the end of World War II, yet it would likely not get a permanent seat if the UN Security Council were re- designed decades later. Historical institutionalist works tend to reject functionalist accounts of institutions. Historical institutionalists tend to see origins behind the creation of institutions as the result of conflict and contestation, which then gets locked in and persists, even if the circumstances that resulted in the institution change. Reception Historical institutionalism is not a unified intellectual enterprise (see also new institutionalism). Some scholars are oriented towards treating history as the outcome of rational and purposeful behavior based on the idea of equilibrium (see rational choice). They rely heavily on quantitative approaches and formal theory. Others, more qualitative oriented scholars, reject the idea of rationality and instead emphasize the idea that randomness and accidents matter in political and social outcomes.. There are unsolvable epistemological differences between both approaches.. However given the historicity of both approaches, and given their focus on institutions, both can fall under \\"historical institutionalism\\". * It could be said that path dependence claims causality because every juncture must be considered causal to further developments (i.e. Z couldn‚Äôt occur without W, X and Y). In that sense, it is more deterministic than statistical analysis because at the latter acknowledge only probabilistic relations among variables. ‚ÄúCorrelation is not causation‚Äù. * Path dependence, in the economic sense, is also subjective because it involves the judgment of the researcher in determining which historical conjunctures had an effect on the outcome why others don‚Äôt (selecting on the dependent variable). The subjectivity becomes accentuated because one can claim that the smallest historical event can shape the larger outcomes (e.g.: a man got drunk, the next morning he was involved in manufacturing 20 rifles that were sent to the same regiment and the rifles didn‚Äôt aim right and the battle was lost and then the war). Where should we trace the causal thread? How much history is needed? Avner Greif and David Laitin have criticized the notion of increased returns. Sociological institutionalists and ideational scholars have criticized versions of Historical Institutionalism that adopt materialist and rationalist ontologies. Scholars who use ideational approaches argue that institutional change occurs during episodes when institutions are perceived be failing (such as during economic crises) or during episodes of uncertainty, as this creates room for an exchange of ideas and a receptivity for institutional change. Political scientists such as Henry Farrell, Martha Finnemore, Mark Blyth, Oddny Helgad√≥ttir, and William Kring argue that Historical Institutionalism has over time tended to engage more with rational choice institutionalism than with sociological institutionalism. In Paradigms and Sand Castles, an influential book on research design in comparative politics, Barbara Geddes argues that there are methodological limits to the kind of path-dependent arguments that is often found in Historical Institutionalist research. She argues that it is hard to rule out rival explanations for a proposed outcome and to precisely identify one purported critical juncture or another.

Rodilla is a Spain-based fast food chain that specializes in cold and hot sandwiches, salads, pastries and fried dishes for dining in or take-out. History About 1939 or 1940 Antonio Rodilla opened a confectionery shop in Callao Square in downtown Madrid. After some years he decided to sell a new line of products, cold meat (fiambre) sandwiches. Since it was difficult at the time to find a good bread supplier he decided to make his own sliced bread as well, called \\"English bread\\", or pan de molde (as opposed to the more traditional baguette-like bread). In the early 1970s Rodilla opened two new establishments in Princesa and Orense streets, and in 1992 the new firm Artesan√≠a de la Alimentaci√≥n was created to centralize the production of their own raw materials.

APY figures allow a reasonable, single-point comparison of different offerings with varying compounding schedules. However, it does not account for the possibility of account fees affecting the net gain. APY generally refers to the rate paid to a depositor by a financial institution, while the analogous annual percentage rate (APR) refers to the rate paid to a financial institution by a borrower. To promote financial products that do not involve debt, banks and other firms will often quote the APY (as opposed to the APR because the APY represents the customer receiving a higher return at the end of the term). For example, a CD that has a 4.65% APR, compounded monthly, would instead be quoted as a 4.65% APY.http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/FreePubs/pdfs/ui392.pdf Equation One common mathematical definition of APY uses this effective interest rate formula, but the precise usage may depend on local laws. : \\\\text{APY} = \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac {i_\\\\text{nom}} {N} \\\\right)^N - 1, where : i_\\\\text{nom} is the nominal interest rate and : N is the number of compounding periods per year. For large N we have :\\\\text{APY} \\\\approx e^{i_\\\\text{nom}} - 1, where e is the base of natural logarithms (the formula follows the definition of e as a limit). This is a reasonable approximation if the compounding is daily. Also, it is worth noting that a nominal interest rate and its corresponding APY are very nearly equal when they are small. For example (fixing some large N), a nominal interest rate of 100% would have an APY of approximately 171%, whereas 5% corresponds to 5.12%, and 1% corresponds to 1.005%. United States For financial institutions in the United States, the calculation of the APY and the related annual percentage yield earned are regulated by the FDIC Truth in Savings Act of 1991:http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-3400.html The calculation method is defined ashttp://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/6500-3270.html#6500appendixatopart230 : \\\\text{APY} = 100 \\\\left[ \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{\\\\text{interest}}{\\\\text{principal}} \\\\right)^{365 / \\\\text{days in term}} - 1 \\\\right] Algebraically, this is equivalent to : \\\\text{interest} = \\\\text{principal} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\text{APY}}{100} + 1 \\\\right)^{\\\\text{days in term}/365} - 1 \\\\right]. Here : \\"principal\\" is the amount of funds assumed to have been deposited at the beginning of the account, : \\"interest\\" is the total dollar amount of interest earned on the Principal for the term of the account, : \\"days in term\\" is the actual number of days in the term of the account.

Cooper, instead of his pseudonym, Dan Cooper, due to a confusion. A facial composite is a graphical representation of one or more eyewitnesses' memory of a face, as recorded by a composite artist. Facial composites are used mainly by police in their investigation of (usually serious) crimes. These images are used to reconstruct the suspect's face in hope of identifying them. Methods=PhotoFIT generation Construction of the composite was originally performed by a trained artist, through drawing, sketching, or painting, in consultation with a witness or crime victim. Subsequently, techniques were devised for use by those less artistically skilled, employing interchangeable templates of separate facial features. The first such mechanical system, called \\"Identikit\\", was introduced in the U.S. in 1959; it used drawings of facial features on transparent acetate sheets that could be superimposed on one another to produce the composite image. (A later version of Identikit is made by Smith & Wesson.) In 1970, a system called \\"Photofit\\", which aimed for greater realism by using actual photographs of facial features, was introduced in the U.K. In the last two decades, a number of computer based facial composite systems have been introduced; amongst the most widely used systems are SketchCop FACETTE Face Design System Software, \\"Identi-Kit 2000\\", FACES, E-FIT and PortraitPad. In the U.S. the FBI maintains that hand-drawing is its preferred method for constructing a facial composite. Many other police agencies, however, use software, since suitable artistic talent is often not available. Evolutionary systems Until quite recently, the facial composite systems used by international police forces were exclusively based on a construction methodology in which individual facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc.) are selected one at a time from a large database and then electronically 'overlaid' to make the composite image. Such systems are often referred to as feature-based since they essentially rely on the selection of individual features in isolation. However, after a long period of research and development work conducted largely within British universities, systems based on a rather different principle are finding increasing use by police forces. These systems may be broadly described as holistic or global in that they primarily attempt to create a likeness to the suspect through an evolutionary mechanism in which a witness's response to groups of complete faces (not just features) converges towards an increasingly accurate image. Three such systems have come from academic beginnings, EFIT-V from the University of Kent; EvoFIT from the University of Stirling, the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) and the University of Winchester; and ID from the University of Cape Town, South Africa. GFE is an experimental evolutionary face compositing system using image gradient instead of luminance to represent faces, which seems to produce better quality composites.Garc√≠a-Zurdo, R. \\"Evolving Faces in Gradient Space\\". Conference of the British Psychological Society, Cognitive Psychology Section. Barcelona, September 2016. Research A general review of research into the evaluation of mechanical template techniques may be found in Davies and Valentine (2006). A review of research into more modern 'feature' and 'recognition' systems, and into methods for improving the effectiveness of composites, may be found in Frowd et al. (2008) and (2009). The systems used in the UK have been subjected to a number of academic studies. These have typically shown that E-FIT and PRO-fit produce composites that are correctly named, either immediately or a few hours after construction, about 20% of the time (see Brace et al. (2000), Bruce et al. (2002), Davies et al. (2000) and Frowd et al. (2005)). When witnesses in these studies are required to wait two days before constructing a composite, which matches real use more closely, naming falls to a few percent at best (e.g. Frowd et al. [2005] and [2007]). The reason for the low level of naming from these systems appears to be that witnesses are unable to accurately construct the internal features of the face after long delays, the region that is important for recognition by another person later (Frowd et al. [2007]). Evolutionary systems show a marked improvement in accuracy. In academic trials, research on a fairly-recent version of the EvoFIT system has shown correct naming levels of about 30% after a 2-day delay (see Frowd et al., 2010). Using more-recent construction techniques, the performance increased to 45% correct naming (Frowd et al., 2012). Using the very latest system, interview and enhancement techniques, naming of an EvoFIT composite is 74% correct (Frowd et al., 2013). Appropriately, the system does appear to behave more like a face recognition than a face recall system (Frowd et al., 2011) Accompanying the development of EvoFIT have been new approaches in the type of interview administered to eyewitnesses prior to face construction (e.g. Frowd et al., 2012). Similarly in extensive field use EFIT-V has shown a 40% naming rate over an 18-month period with 1000 interviews. The EvoFIT system has been similarly evaluated in formal police field-trials. These evaluations have reported a much higher naming rate for EvoFIT composites but, using the latest interview techniques, a suspect arrest rate of 60%. This latest police field trial has also indicated that an EvoFIT directly leads to the arrest of a suspect and then a conviction in 29% of cases. File:Caesius facial composite.jpg A facial composite produced by FACES software File:PortraitPad.jpgA facial composite produced by PortraitPad software Usage Facial composite of Aafia Siddiqui, created by the FBI for a wanted poster While the classic use of the facial composite is the citizen recognizing the face as an acquaintance, there are other ways where a facial composite can prove useful. The facial composite can contribute in law enforcement in a number of ways: # Identifying the suspect in a wanted poster. # Additional evidence against a suspect. # Assisting investigation in checking leads. # Warning vulnerable population against serial offenders. Facial composites of various types have been used extensively in those television programs which aim to reconstruct major unsolved crimes with a view to gaining information from the members of the public, such as \\"America's Most Wanted\\" in the US and \\"Crimewatch\\" in the UK.

The Disneyland version opened on January 26, 1994, a year after the Mickey's Toontown area opened, and the Tokyo Disneyland version opened on April 15, 1996.  History  Roger Rabbit was recognized as a lucrative character by Disney after the release of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and an ambitious set of attractions based on the movie were developed for many Disney theme parks. Roger was even set to be the star of his own land, behind Main Street, U.S.A. at Disneyland, called Hollywoodland. Meanwhile, over at the Magic Kingdom, a new land behind Fantasyland was being developed in honor of Mickey Mouse's sixtieth birthday, named Mickey's Birthdayland. There were also set to be attractions based on Roger Rabbit, Judge Doom and Baby Herman opening in a major expansion at Disney's Hollywood Studios and Tokyo Disneyland, but after the financial troubles of the Euro Disney Resort, plans were cut back with only Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland receiving any Roger Rabbit-themed attractions. In the ride, Marvin Acme's \\"Acme Warehouse\\" from the film is called the \\"Gag Warehouse.\\" Imagineer Joe Lanzisero described the creation of the ride: Queue and Ride The loading area in Disneyland, California. Entering the Toontown Cab Company, the queue winds its way through darkened Toontown streets and alleys, passing through the Ink and Paint Club's backstage areas like Jessica Rabbit's dressing room and the prop cage, then past the window of Baby Herman's apartment. In a window on the upper floors, the shadows of the Toon Patrol can be seen plotting to Dip the city with the queue passing above their Dip refinery. Exiting this area, the guests return to the Toontown Cab Company and approach the loading area. Characters' voices can also be heard throughout the queue, including two points where the Toon Patrol can be heard discussing their plans, one in the alley in front of the Ink and Paint Club and the other in their hideout. Jessica can also be heard talking on the phone outside her dressing room door. At the start of the ride's queue, some license plates hanging on the wall have code-like puns of various Disney characters or slogans. They include 2N TOWN (Toontown), BB WOLF (Big Bad Wolf), MR TOAD (Mr. Toad), 1DRLND (Wonderland), 1D N PTR (Wendy & Peter Pan), IM L8 (I'm late - The White Rabbit), CAP 10 HK (Captain Hook), L MERM8 (The Little Mermaid), 101 DLMN (101 Dalmatians), FAN T C (Fantasy), RS2CAT (Aristocat), ZPD2DA (Zip-a- Dee-Doo-Dah), and 3 LIL PIGS (Three Little Pigs). Guests board a yellow Toon cab named Lenny the Cab, the twin cousin of Benny the Cab. Each cab seats two people, and the cabs are dispatched in groups of two. Once the traffic light in the loading area changes to green (with the hand on its side pointing left), the cabs leave the loading area. The ride begins with Stupid, Greasy and Wheezy dumping barrels of Dip into the streets, sending Roger Rabbit and Benny spinning out of control, and the guests' cab drives into the Dip as well. At this point, the steering wheel of the cab becomes active, and the cab can then spin around, much like Fantasyland's Mad Tea Party. Nearby, Smarty has tied up Jessica and placed her in the trunk of his car. The cabs then crash through a China shop run by a bull, who is trying to protect some of his stock. Upon exiting the shop, the cars travel down Spin Street, where Toon fire hydrants, power cables, mailboxes, and streetlights laugh and dance around. Next, the cabs enter the Toontown Power House, where they pass a furnace with an abstract face and encounter Roger having an electricity fight with Psycho. Passing through a series of explosions, the cabs \\"fall down\\" from Toon skyscrapers. Heading closer to street level past a group of stairs, Roger promises to fix things. The cabs then enter the Gag Factory, going past various jokes and gags, and a weasel named Sleazy holds a large metal gate open for the cabs, intending to \\"put them out of contrition\\". Jessica manages to free herself and assault Greasy and Wheezy. Stupid then tries to drop a safe onto the cabs. Just as the Dip Machine (operated by Smarty) is about to Dip the cabs, they narrowly escape and Roger saves the day by stretching his arm out and using a portable hole to allow the cabs to return safely to the Toontown Cab Company, going through a cartoon \\"The End\\" title card to return to the loading area.

Setting The Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests extends across the alluvial plain of the lower Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers, which form the world's largest river delta. The ecoregion is currently one of the most densely populated regions on earth, and the forests have largely been replaced with intensive agriculture. The ecoregion is bounded on the east and northeast by montane tropical rain forests; the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests covers the Chin Hills and Chittagong Hills to the east, extending into Myanmar and other states of Northeast India, while the Meghalaya subtropical forests covers the Garo- Khasi-Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya and southern Assam, and almost defines the Bangladesh border with Northeast India. To the north, the ecoregion extends to the base of the Himalayas, where it is bounded by the Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands. The upper portion of the Brahmaputra valley in Assam is home to the humid lowland Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests. To the northwest, the forests are bounded by the Upper Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests. The dry Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests lie on the Chota Nagpur Plateau to the southwest. The Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests and Sundarbans mangroves ecoregions lie in the swampy, semi-brackish and brackish southern reaches of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta bordering the Bay of Bengal.

These memory areas are called segments in Intel terminology. Global Descriptor Table The GDT can hold things other than segment descriptors as well. Every 8-byte entry in the GDT is a descriptor, but these descriptors can be references not only to memory segments but also to Task State Segment (TSS), Local Descriptor Table (LDT), or Call Gate structures in memory. The last ones, Call Gates, are particularly important for transferring control between x86 privilege levels although this mechanism is not used on most modern operating systems. There is also a Local Descriptor Table (LDT). Multiple LDTs can be defined in the GDT, but only one is current at any one time: usually associated with the current Task. While the LDT contains memory segments which are private to a specific program, the GDT contains global segments. The x86 processors have facilities for automatically switching the current LDT on specific machine events, but no facilities for automatically switching the GDT. Every memory access which a program can perform always goes through a segment. On the 80386 processor and later, because of 32-bit segment offsets and limits, it is possible to make segments cover the entire addressable memory, which makes segment-relative addressing transparent to the user. In order to reference a segment, a program must use its index inside the GDT or the LDT. Such an index is called a segment selector (or selector). The selector must generally be loaded into a segment register to be used. Apart from the machine instructions which allow one to set/get the position of the GDT, and of the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), in memory, every machine instruction referencing memory has an implicit Segment Register, occasionally two. Most of the time this Segment Register can be overridden by adding a Segment Prefix before the instruction. Loading a selector into a segment register automatically reads the GDT or the LDT and stores the properties of the segment inside the processor itself. Subsequent modifications to the GDT or LDT will not be effective unless the segment register is reloaded. Format of a segment descriptor  GDT example  Shown below is an assembly implementation of a GDT which opens up all 4 GB of available memory: ;base = 0x00000000, segment limit = 0xffffffff ; offset 0x0 .null descriptor: dq 0 ; offset 0x8 .code: ; cs should point to this descriptor dw 0xffff ; segment limit first 0-15 bits dw 0 ; base first 0-15 bits db 0 ; base 16-23 bits db 0x9a ; access byte db 11001111b ; high 4 bits (flags) low 4 bits (limit 4 last bits)(limit is 20 bit wide) db 0 ; base 24-31 bits ; offset 0x10 .data: ; ds, ss, es, fs, and gs should point to this descriptor dw 0xffff ; segment limit first 0-15 bits dw 0 ; base first 0-15 bits db 0 ; base 16-23 bits db 0x92 ; access byte db 11001111b ; high 4 bits (flags) low 4 bits (limit 4 last bits)(limit is 20 bit wide) db 0 ; base 24-31 bits  GDT in 64-bit  The GDT is still present in 64-bit mode; a GDT must be defined, but is generally never changed or used for segmentation. The size of the register has been extended from 48 to 80 bits, and 64-bit selectors are always \\"flat\\" (thus, from 0x0000000000000000 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). However, the base of FS and GS are not constrained to 0, and they continue to be used as pointers to the offset of items such as the process environment block and the thread information block. If the System bit (4th bit of the Access field) is cleared, the size of the descriptor is 16 bytes instead of 8. This is because, even though code/data segments are ignored, TSS are not, but the TSS pointer can be 64bit long and thus the descriptor needs more space to insert the higher dword of the TSS pointer. 64-bit versions of Windows forbid hooking of the GDT; attempting to do so will cause the machine to bug check. Local Descriptor Table A Local Descriptor Table (LDT) is a memory table used in the x86 architecture in protected mode and containing memory segment descriptors, just like the GDT: address start in linear memory, size, executability, writability, access privilege, actual presence in memory, etc. LDTs are the siblings of the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), and each define up to 8192 memory segments accessible to programs - note that unlike the GDT, the zeroeth entry is a valid entry, and can be used like any other LDT entry. Also note that unlike the GDT, the LDT cannot be used to store certain system entries: TSSs or LDTs. Call Gates and Task Gates are fine, however.  History  On x86 processors not having paging features, like the Intel 80286, the LDT is essential to implementing separate address spaces for multiple processes. There will be generally one LDT per user process, describing privately held memory, while shared memory and kernel memory will be described by the GDT. The operating system will switch the current LDT when scheduling a new process, using the LLDT machine instruction or when using a TSS. On the contrary, the GDT is generally not switched (although this may happen if virtual machine monitors like VMware are running on the computer). The lack of symmetry between both tables is underlined by the fact that the current LDT can be automatically switched on certain events, notably if TSS-based multitasking is used, while this is not possible for the GDT. The LDT also cannot store certain privileged types of memory segments (e.g. TSSes). Finally, the LDT is actually defined by a descriptor inside the GDT, while the GDT is directly defined by a linear address. Creating shared memory through the GDT has some drawbacks. Notably such memory is visible to every process and with equal rights. In order to restrict visibility and to differentiate the protection of shared memory, for example to only allow read-only access for some processes, one can use separate LDT entries, pointed at the same physical memory areas and only created in the LDTs of processes which have requested access to a given shared memory area. LDT (and GDT) entries which point to identical memory areas are called aliases. Aliases are also typically created in order to get write access to code segments: an executable selector cannot be used for writing. (Protected mode programs constructed in the so- called tiny memory model, where everything is located in the same memory segment, must use separate selectors for code and data/stack, making both selectors technically \\"aliases\\" as well.) In the case of the GDT, aliases are also created in order to get access to system segments like the TSSes. Segments have a \\"Present\\" flag in their descriptors, allowing them to be removed from memory if the need arises. For example, code segments or unmodified data segments can be thrown away, and modified data segments can be swapped out to disk. However, because entire segments need to be operated on as a unit, it is necessary to limit their size in order to ensure that swapping can happen in a timely fashion. However, using smaller, more easily swappable segments means that segment registers must be reloaded more frequently which is itself a time-consuming operation.  Modern usage  The Intel 80386 microprocessor introduced paging - allocating separate physical memory pages (themselves very small units of memory) at the same virtual addresses, with the advantage that disk paging is far faster and more efficient than segment swapping. Therefore, modern 32-bit x86 operating systems use the LDT very little, primarily to run legacy 16-bit code. Should 16-bit code need to run in a 32-bit environment while sharing memory (this happens e.g. when running OS/2 1.x programs on OS/2 2.0 and later), the LDT must be written in such a way that every flat (paged) address has also a selector in the LDT (typically this results in the LDT being filled with 64 KiB entries). This technique is sometimes called LDT tiling. The limited size of the LDT means the virtual flat address space has to be limited to 512 megabytes (8191 times 64 KiB) - this is what happens on OS/2, although this limitation was fixed in version 4.5. It is also necessary to make sure that objects allocated in the 32-bit environment do not cross 64 KiB boundaries; this generates some address space waste. If 32-bit code does not have to pass arbitrary memory objects to 16-bit code, e.g. presumably in the OS/2 1.x emulation present in Windows NT or in the Windows 3.1 emulation layer, it is not necessary to artificially limit the size of the 32-bit address space.

His work was mainly in theater, but he worked in films and television sporadically from 1958. He is known for television roles on Matlock, and Seinfeld, and particularly as Doctor Hayward on Twin Peaks, a series co-created by his son Mark Frost. He has also appeared in TV movies, such as Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) and The Stand (1994). Early life, military service and education Frost was born in 1925 in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and was raised in the Bronx and Essex Junction, Vermont. At the age of 17, he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II, and served aboard the destroyer escort in Europe during the Normandy landings. At the age of 21, he enrolled as an English major at Middlebury College in Vermont under the G.I. Bill. Acting career Frost spent much of his career in the Twin Cities, teaching at the University of Minnesota and serving as artistic director of the Chimera Theater in St. Paul. He had a small yet memorable role in the film adaptation of Slaughterhouse Five (1972), which was shot in the Minneapolis area. Frost's Hollywood work in shows such as Twin Peaks and Matlock was essentially his second career, following his retirement from teaching and stage direction. He was aged 60 when his son Mark, co-creator of Twin Peaks with David Lynch, cast him in the role of Dr. Will Hayward. Frost appeared in thirty episodes of the series, and reprised the role in the feature film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me although his scenes were cut. His appearance in Twin Peaks led to a recurring role in the legal drama Matlock. In the Matlock TV series he played Billy Lewis. In the Seinfeld TV series he played Henry Ross, father of Susan Ross, George Costanza's fianc√©e. His onscreen wife in Seinfeld was played by his Twin Peaks co-star Grace Zabriskie. Frost returned to play Doc Hayward in the revived series of Twin Peaks, which began airing in May 2017. Personal life and death Frost married Mary Virginia Calhoun in 1949 and was the father of novelist, television screenwriter and producer Mark Frost, actress Lindsay Frost and writer Scott Frost. He was the grandfather of baseball player Lucas Giolito and actor Casey Giolito.Amanda Comak, \\"Lucas Giolito‚Äôs talent too tantalizing for Nationals to pass on\\", The Washington Post, June 5, 2012.

Facts Ganweriwala is situated near the Indian border on the dry river bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra, now part of a vast desert. It is spread over 80 hectares and comparable in size with the largest sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as Mohenjo-daro. But it has not been excavated, only identified. It may turn out to be among the top five largest towns of the Indus Valley Civilisation. Significant finds Although excavation has yet to begin at this site, a stray find of a terracotta tablet is a significant find. In this seal, a cross legged person (suggesting a yogic posture) and a kneeling person below a tree and upon a tree are depicted. Such kneeling persons on a tree, particularly in front of a tiger like animal, are shown in tablets or seals found at Harappa (H 163 a), Mohenjadaro (M 309 a) and Kalibangan (K 49a). More recently Sidra Gulzar and Asko Parpola discovered an inscribed tablet from Ganweriwala that may ultimately help to solve the riddle of the Indus Valley script. Despite its degraded condition, one can see the horn of the missing ‚Äúunicorn bull\\" to the bottom right, plus seven signs of the Indus script.

The only character to appear in all 52 episodes of the series, Vila was particularly known for his humorous lines and his banter with Kerr Avon. In the new audio series, Vila is played by Dean Harris; however Michael Keating returned to the role for the story When Vila Met Gan. Michael Keating has reprised his role as \\"Vila\\" in several volumes of the Liberator Chronicles (a series of enhanced audiobooks released by Big Finish in a licence deal with B7 Enterprises) and the series of Full Cast audio dramas produced by the same company, released from January 2014. Character biography A native of Earth and a member of the lowly Delta grade criminal underclass (similar to the classes established in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World), Vila is a petty thief who meets Blake in the detention cell awaiting transport to Cygnus Alpha. Whilst Blake is asleep, Vila was picking Blake's pockets. Vila later participates in a prisoner mutiny aboard the transport ship London. He remains on the London when Blake, Avon and Jenna escape in the Liberator, finally leaving the penal planet Cygnus Alpha with Blake. Vila is more intelligent than his Delta grade rating suggests, claiming to have bought that designation to avoid being drafted as a spaceship captain. Vila is a talented thief who can break into the most sophisticated security systems. This ability makes him useful to Blake's crew; in the episode City At the Edge of the World, Avon tells Del Tarrant that \\"...we can find a pilot anywhere, but a talented thief is rare.\\" Vila is often lazy and cowardly, preferring to evade danger. He claims he wants \\"...to live forever, or die trying.\\" Actor Michael Keating described the character as \\"...a survivor\\", doing what was necessary to stay alive and not caring as much about the ideals of Blake or the ambitions of Avon. Vila is a poor fighter - his confusion costs the rebels the battle in Spacefall, and he is momentarily shocked after stabbing a fanatical monk in Cygnus Alpha. Vila greatly enjoys drinking and gambling, making the Liberator crew keep him away from situations where his vices could compromise the mission (Shadow, Killer, Gambit). However, he demonstrates courage and resourcefulness when needed, choosing to join with Blake instead of staying on Cygnus Alpha, grabbing Orac before being teleported off the Liberator in Terminal and re-entering the Terminal complex to save Tarrant (Rescue). He demonstrates immense skill and heroism in City at the Edge of the World, where he develops a short-lived but intense romance with Kerril, a female gunfighter. Vila admires Blake, but possibly his closest friend is Gan, whose honesty he trusts. His relationship with Avon is considered by many fans to be a highlight of the series. It is a mixture of respect and loathing. They share a common cynicism and focus on material success as demonstrated in Gambit. They clearly respect each other's skills and work together effectively (Killer). They often sparred over Avon's ruthlessness and Vila's cowardice. In Spacefall, Vila suggests killing Avon, anticipating that Avon would scheme to have other prisoners thrown out of an airlock. During the fourth series episode Orbit, Avon tries to throw Vila out of the airlock of a spaceship that cannot reach its escape velocity. Although another solution is found and they survived the ordeal, the incident created a cooling of their relationship. Vila is fond of attractive women; during Cally's first episode, he calls out to her \\"Don't shoot, pretty lady!\\" He sometimes engages in playful, and sometimes more serious, bantering with Cally, Dayna and Soolin. While Cally treated Vila's jokes as playful remarks from a friend, both Dayna and Soolin considered him to be quite lecherous. The rest of the crew are aware of this; during the episode \\"Headhunter\\", Vila remarks that he was a \\"...perfect gentleman\\" to Muller's female partner, to which Tarrant replied \\"That's what bothered us.\\" However, Vila was capable of genuine affection and concern for his female friends; despite his lecherous comments and flirtations with her at the outset, his relationship with Kerril developed quickly into love, with Vila offering to sacrifice himself so that Kerril would escape. Similarly, during the episode Sand he was shown to be very upset with Soolin when she mentions Cally's death. Along with rest of the Scorpio crew, Vila is gunned down during the final shoot-out on Gauda Prime. He is presumed to have died, although there has been much speculation that he pretended to fall to avoid getting killed. In the non-canonical novel \\"Afterlife\\" by Tony Attwood, this is what happened and Vila stays with Avon to continue their adventures‚Äîalthough bitterly resentful of Avon's killing of Blake.  Character development  The character was twice considered for removal from the series, according to the DVD commentaries of script editor Chris Boucher and producer David Maloney. Terry Nation originally wanted Vila to be killed in Pressure Point but was overruled by the other producers. Later, it was briefly suggested killing off Vila and Jenna in 'Star One'; he remained because a survey showed Vila to be the series' second most popular character. In an interview with Tony Attwood, Keating said that he was watching the series with his daughter when she said, \\"Daddy, you're stupid!\\" Keating related this to Boucher, inspiring the latter to write City at the Edge of the World in which Vila becomes a hero. During the production of Orbit, while Avon looks for Vila to throw from the airlock, Keating was filmed hiding, shaking and in tears. These few seconds were not broadcast because the director considered the scene \\"...too real\\". Following this episode, Vila becomes very wary of Avon's motives.

She is the titular subject of an audio drama released in August 2009. Development It was originally intended that Cally would wear black contact lenses to make her look more alien. Jonathan Bignell and Andrew O'Day write that \\"Cally (Jan Chappell), conceived much later as an alien from the planet Saurian Major (Stevens and Moore 2003: 19), is introduced in the fourth episode 'Time Squad'. In early drafts of the episode 'she was explicitly described as being like 'an Israeli terrorist girl' and her name echoes Kali, the Hindu goddess of death (Stevens and Moore 2003: 19). In the final televised version she is the only survivor of a guerrilla force that attacked the Federation, and comes closest to paralleling Blake's political aims.\\" Fictional biography=Character overview Cally was the only alien amongst the original crew, a native of the planet Auron.In the B7 audio dramas, the \\"Callys\\" are a clone familial line, exclusively female and like most Auron's telepathically linked each to the other, with the link strongest between members of the same cr√®che or clone batch, and the elder \\"Cally\\" cr√®ches referred to as \\"Aunties\\". She left her home world to help the resistance fighters on Saurian Major and was subsequently exiled by her isolationist people. When a chemical poison was dropped on the rebels, she was the only survivor and was determined to make a suicide attack on the base until she met and joined with Blake. She was initially ashamed to return to Auron because she was the only survivor of the resistance. Cally was the only member of the original seven who was not a convicted criminal. Like other members of the Auron race, Cally was telepathic and her psychic abilities were a great asset to the crew. On the other hand, it occasionally made her susceptible to being taken over by telepathic influence (\\"The Web,\\" \\"Shadow,\\" \\"Sarcophagus\\"). While her initial role was monitoring communications, she eventually became a skilled medic and pilot. Initially as fanatical as Blake in fighting the Federation, she, along with Gan, became the moral \\"conscience\\" of the crew, once even questioning Blake whether destroying Star One was worth the \\"many many (innocent) people\\" he would kill as a result. She even questions his entire crusade, wondering if he has made them all 'fanatics' to which Blake becomes defensive. Cally has come a long way from the rebel who would kill until she was killed on Saurian Major, developing the conscience which Blake never showed in his terrorist acts. While Cally was rather distant and philosophical at first, as the series went on she became more connected to the crew and would display a dry wit on occasion. Tragedy eventually marked Cally. Servalan, in a gambit to have herself cloned, deliberately infected Auron with a disease to which she alone had the cure. Almost all of the Aurons were killed, including Cally's twin sister Zelda. Cally herself was later killed by Servalan's explosives on Terminal in series four opener Rescue, whilst calling out to Vila with her last thoughts. Avon confirmed her death after returning to the ruined and collapsing tunnels. He was very certain when he tells Tarrant, his voice becoming softer, as it is often when talking to or about Cally, and then he looks away in the distance. Reception The character has been positively received by fans and critics alike. Ben Rawson-Jones describes the character as \\"Blake's 7 fans‚Äô‚Ä¶ beloved Cally.\\" In a review of her debut, John Bensalhia writes, \\"One of the most popular regulars, Cally is well portrayed by Jan Chappell right from the word go. Initially, she's seen as a tough-as-nails freedom fighter, hostile to Blake, and ready to commit suicide after the deaths of her fellow companions. Already at this story, we're given some clue as to how Cally interacts with her future friends - she looks up to Blake as the leader, Vila's clearly taken with her, but Cally is more interested in Avon, who, amazingly, seems to return the interest, given his distrust of other people. It's a shame that Cally's part would be watered down in future stories - especially in Season Two, where she's mostly stuck glum-faced behind the teleport controls - but here at least, she gets a strong debut.\\" In a more scholarly analysis, Camille Bacon-Smith writes, \\"In the Blake's 7 character Cally, who can never experience the telepathic presence of another because her people are dead and the humans cannot communicate on her level, the loneliness of many women who feel that they give understanding but receive nothing back to nurture their sense of belonging finds representation.\\" Bacon-Smith identifies further a contrast between Mr. Spock and Cally, noting how unlike Spock, \\"the telepathic alien Cally on Blake's 7 could send thoughts but could only receive those sent by another telepath. Separated from her own people, Cally could communicate with others at the level of the mind, but she could never receive communication in return. Whereas for Spock telepathy diminished the solitude of the alien, for Cally telepathy only made her alien solitude more acute. Bacon-Smith goes on to argue that while \\"Mr. Spock represents the positive value of an understanding merged with the other, Cally represents the tragedy when comprehension of the totality of the other is forever denied.\\" Audio drama In the Blake's 7 Productions audio drama series Blake's 7: The Early Years three Callys appear in the story Blood and Earth: Ariane (played by Amy Humphreys), Jorden (played by Barbara Joslyn), with Jan Chappell playing an elder relative, \\"Cally Secundus\\" (the second Cally ever to be born on Auron).Cally Returns b7media.

Newman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana to Dwight, (pianist) and Louise Newman, a musical family, having his first music lessons from David Jones. He attended Alabama State College, where he joined the college band (the Bama State Collegians), became its leader, and took it on tour. In 1941 he joined Lionel Hampton for two years, before signing with Count Basie, with whom he stayed for a total of thirteen years, interrupted by short breaks and a long period (1947‚Äì1952) spent first with saxophonist Illinois Jacquet and then drummer J. C. Heard. During his second period with Basie, which lasted for about nine years, he made a number of small-group recordings as the leader. He also played on Benny Goodman's 1962 tour of the Soviet Union. In 1961 Newman left the Basie band and helped to found Jazz Interactions, of which he became president in 1967. His wife, Rigmor Alfredsson Newman was the Executive Director. Jazz Interactions was a charitable organization which provided an information service, brought jazz master classes into schools and colleges, and later maintained its own Jazz Interaction Orchestra (for which Newman wrote). In the 1970s and 1980s, Newman toured internationally and recorded for various major record labels. He suffered a stroke in 1991, however, which seriously disabled him, and he died of complications from it in 1992.

He is also a minor character in the 2004 novel The Godfather Returns. Roth is a Jewish mobster and investor and a business partner of Vito Corleone, and later his son Michael Corleone. He is based on New York mobster Meyer Lansky and was played by Lee Strasberg in the movie. It was Al Pacino who suggested Strasberg, his former acting teacher, for the role. Character overview Roth's background is supplied in a deleted scene in The Godfather Part II. In this scene, set in Little Italy, New York in the early 1920s, he is working as a car mechanic. He is noticed by Peter Clemenza, who has been calling him \\"Johnny Lips\\". Clemenza introduces him to Vito Corleone, who suggests that he change his name, which was originally Hyman Suchowsky. When Vito asks him whom he admires, Suchowsky says Arnold Rothstein, for having fixed the 1919 World Series; accordingly, he changes his last name to Roth. Dialogue later in the film explains that Roth worked diligently with the Corleone family during Prohibition, and was a close friend and ally of Moe Greene, the \\"inventor\\" of Las Vegas. Roth, as well as Don Corleone, started out running molasses out of Havana and into Canada. Michael says that his father Vito respected Hyman Roth, did business with Hyman Roth, but never trusted Hyman Roth, nor did many of his associates, including Frank Pentangeli. The Godfather Part II By the timeline of this film, Roth is based in Miami. Though in seemingly poor health, he is extremely wealthy, having made a fortune by running his own organized crime outfit, assisted by his right-hand man, Sicilian Johnny Ola. Roth forms a partnership with Michael Corleone for a profitable business enterprise with the corrupt Cuban government of Fulgencio Batista and a number of major American corporations. Roth secretly plans to assassinate Michael, partly to avenge Moe Greene's murder (as depicted in The Godfather). Roth instructs Ola to befriend Michael's brother Fredo, who provides Ola (and Roth) information about Michael that enables them to make an attempt on his life. Michael quickly realizes that Roth perpetrated the murder plot. Remembering his father's advice to \\"keep enemies close,\\" he maintains a good business relationship with Roth. Michael also suspects a mole within the Corleone family aided Roth, and needs time to uncover his identity. On New Year's Eve 1958, the last night of Batista's rule, Michael orders Roth killed, confiding to Fredo that Roth will not see the New Year. Just as Michael's bodyguard Bussetta attempts to smother Roth with a pillow in the hospital, Batista's soldiers storm the facility and kill Bussetta. Moments later, Fidel Castro's army enters the city, overthrowing the Batista regime and ruining Roth and Michael's plans. Shortly after the Cuban fiasco, the U.S. Senate begins hearings on organized crime. To eliminate Michael as a competitor, Roth manipulates Corleone family caporegime Frank Pentangeli into testifying against Michael by having the Rosato Brothers, two small-time hoods, attempt to kill Pentangeli. He survives and, believing Michael ordered the attack, agrees to testify against the Corleone Family at a Senate hearing. The hearing is really a set piece arranged by Roth in hopes of removing Michael from the scene; the Senate committee's chief counsel is on Roth's payroll. As a counter-move, Michael has Pentangeli's brother, Vincenzo, flown in from Sicily to coerce Pentangeli into silence, thus destroying the government's case against Michael. Roth is last seen at the Miami airport, where he publicly states that he wishes to retire and live in Israel under the Law of Return. His request (like that of the real-life Meyer Lansky) is rejected by the Israeli High Court, reportedly due to his criminal ties. Michael arranges to have Roth killed at the airport where he is about to be taken into U.S. Federal custody. Minutes after disembarking the plane, he is fatally shot by Michael's caporegime Rocco Lampone, posing as a reporter. Rocco himself is killed by federal agents as he is escaping.

Blue depicts cell nuclei. The Anopheles gambiae complex consists of at least seven morphologically indistinguishable species of mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. The complex was recognised in the 1960s and includes the most important vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly of the most dangerous malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. It is one of the most efficient malaria vectors known. The An. gambiae mosquito additionally transmits Wuchereria bancrofti which causes Lymphatic philariasis, more commonly known as elephantiasis. Discovery and elements The Anopheles gambiae complex or Anopheles gambiae sensu lato was recognized as a species complex only in the 1960s. The A. gambiae complex consists of: *Anopheles arabiensis *Anopheles bwambae *Anopheles melas *Anopheles merus *Anopheles quadriannulatus *Anopheles gambiae sensu strictoYakob L (2011) Epidemiological consequences of a newly discovered cryptic subgroup of Anopheles gambiae.Biol Lett *Anopheles coluzzii *Anopheles amharicus The individual species of the complex are morphologically difficult to distinguish from each other, although it is possible for larvae and adult females. The species exhibit different behavioural traits. For example, Anopheles quadriannulatus is both a saltwater and mineralwater species. A. melas and A. merus are saltwater species, while the remainder are freshwater species. Anopheles quadriannulatus generally takes its blood meal from animals (zoophilic), whereas Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto generally feeds on humans, i.e. is considered anthropophilic. Identification to the individual species level using the molecular methods of Scott et al. (1993) can have important implications in subsequent control measures.  Anopheles gambiae in the strict sense  An. gambiae s.s. has been discovered to be currently in a state of diverging into two different species‚Äîthe Mopti (M) and Savannah (S) strains‚Äîthough as of 2007, the two strains are still considered to be a single species. The An. gambiae s.s. genome has been sequenced three times, once for the M strain, once for the S strain, and once for a hybrid strain. Currently, ~90 miRNA have been predicted in the literature (38 miRNA officially listed in miRBase) for An. gambiae s.s. based upon conserved sequences to miRNA found in Drosophila. The mechanism of species recognition appears to be sounds emitted by the wings and identified by Johnston's organ.Pennetier C, Warren B, Dabir√© KR, Russell IJ, Gibson G (2009) \\"Singing on the wing\\" as a mechanism for species recognition in the malarial mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Curr. Biol. Fecundity Fecundity of A. gambiae depends on the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by catalase. Reduction in catalase activity significantly reduces reproductive output of female mosquitoes, indicating that catalase plays a central role in protecting oocytes and early embryos from ROS damage.  Historical note  An. gambiae invaded northeastern Brazil in 1930, which led to a malaria epidemic in 1938/1939. The Brazilian government assisted by the Rockefeller Foundation in a programme spearheaded by Fred Soper eradicated these mosquitoes from this area. This effort was modeled on the earlier success in eradication of Aedes aegypti as part of the yellow fever control program. The exact species involved in this epidemic has been identified as An. arabiensis. Role in Malaria Research The spread of malaria by the female mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, is dependent, amongst other things, on its ability to fly. This in turn, is dependent on the adipokinetic hormone, Anoga-HrTH (pGlu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Ala-Trp-NH2). No crystal structure of this important neuropeptide is available and hence NMR restrained molecular dynamics was used to investigate its conformational space in aqueous solution and when bound to a membrane surface. The results showed that Anoga-HrTH has an almost cyclic conformation that is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the C-terminus and Thr3. Upon docking of the agonist to its receptor, this H-bond is broken and the molecule adopts a more extended structure.Preliminary AKHR docking calculations give the free energy of binding to be ‚àí47.30 kJ/mol. There is a close correspondence between the structure of the docked ligand and literature structure‚Äìactivity studies.Information about the 3D structure and binding mode of Anoga-HrTH to its receptor is vital for the design of suitable mimetics which can act as insecticides.

The Farm Credit System provides more than $304 billion in loans, leases, and related services to farmers, ranchers, rural homeowners, aquatic producers, timber harvesters, agribusinesses, and agricultural and rural utility cooperatives. Congress established the Farm Credit System in 1916 to provide a reliable source of credit for farmers and ranchers. Today, the Farm Credit System provides more than one-third of the credit needed by those who live and work in rural America. The Farm Credit System function is to provide a source of credit for American agriculture by making loans to qualified borrowers at competitive rates and providing insurance and related services. Authority Congress established the Farm Credit System as a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) when it enacted the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916. Current authority is granted by the Farm Credit Act of 1971. The Farm Credit System is considered the first GSE chartered by the United States. Oversight The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), an agency of the federal government created in 1933, provides regulatory oversight for the Farm Credit System. The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (FCSIC), established by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, insures the timely repayment of principal and interest on FCS debt securities. Wholesale system banks Farm Credit Bank (and Agricultural Credit Bank) charter territories Farm Credit Bank (FCB) Three Farm Credit Banks (FCBs) provide loan funds to 50 Agricultural Credit Associations (ACAs) and one Federal Land Credit Association (FLCA). In turn, ACAs make short-, intermediate-, and long-term loans, while FLCAs make long- term loans, to farmers, ranchers, producers and harvesters of aquatic products, rural residents for housing, and certain farm-related businesses. There are three FCBs: *AgFirst *AgriBank *Farm Credit Bank of Texas There is also one Agricultural Credit Bank, with the authority of a FCB (and a Bank for Cooperatives): * CoBank FCBs were created on July 6, 1988, in 11 of the 12 then-existing FCS Districts when the FLB and FICB in each district merged. The mergers were required by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Bank for Cooperatives (BC) A Bank for Cooperatives (BC) provides lending and other financial services to farmer-owned cooperatives, rural utilities (electric and telephone), and rural sewer and water systems. A BC is also authorized to finance U.S. agricultural exports and provide international banking services for farmer-owned cooperatives. CoBank is an Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) and has the authority of a Farm Credit Bank and a BC. The last standalone BC, the St. Paul Bank for Cooperatives, merged into CoBank on July 1, 1999. Retail lending associations alt=A map of the United States divided into numerous (83) districts, differentiated by colors, which are grouped by shades indicating the Farm Credit Bank or Agricultural Credit Bank district to which it belongs.thumb Agricultural Credit Association (and two Federal Land Credit Association) charter territories Agricultural Credit Association (ACA) An Agricultural Credit Association (ACA) is the result of the merger of a FLBA or a FLCA and a PCA and has the combined authority of the two institutions. An ACA obtains funds from a FCB or an ACB to provide short-, intermediate-, and long-term credit to farmers, ranchers, producers and harvesters of aquatic products, and to rural residents for housing. An ACA also makes loans to these borrowers for basic processing and marketing activities, and to farm-related businesses. All ACAs operate with a parent- subsidiary structure, with the ACA as the parent and a wholly owned PCA and FLCA as subsidiaries. Federal Land Credit Association (FLCA) The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 authorized an FCS bank to transfer its direct- lending authority for long-term mortgage loans to a FLBA. These Associations are designated as FLCAs. Unlike a FLBA, a FLCA owns its loan assets. An FLCA obtains funds from an FCS bank to make and service long-term mortgage loans to farmers and ranchers, and to rural residents for housing. An FLCA also makes loans to these borrowers for basic processing and marketing activities, and to farm-related businesses. Most present-day FLCAs are now subsidiaries of ACAs. Only nine FLCAs operate independently. Funding institutions=Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation The Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation issues a variety of Federal Farm Credit Banks Consolidated Systemwide Debt Securities (Farm Credit Debt Securities) on behalf of the Farm Credit System Banks with a broad range of maturities and structures. Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) is a government-sponsored enterprise with the mission of providing a secondary market for agricultural real estate and rural housing mortgage loans. Four Points Federal Credit Union Four Points Federal Credit Union is chartered by the National Credit Union Administration to provide credit union membership to employees and retired persons of the Farm Credit System. Spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, and grandparents of eligible members can also join. Through the Nebraska Consumer Council (NECC), Four Points Federal Credit Union has also extended their membership options to anyone who lives, works, attends school or worship services in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska. Historical institutions There are several institutions that have been authorized by law but which have been subsumed by other institutions, which usually retain their authority. FCS Financial Assistance Corporation Created by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 and chartered in 1988, the Assistance Corporation provided capital to the FCS by purchasing preferred stock from FCS institutions that received financial assistance authorized by the FCS Assistance Board. The Assistance Corporation provided approximately $1.26 billion before its authority to raise additional funds expired on December 31, 1992. Following statutory requirements, the Assistance Corporation repaid its obligations in June 2005 and received a final audit in September 2005. After determining that the Assistance Corporation had completed its statutory mission, complied with applicable laws and regulations, and operated in a safe and sound manner, the FCA Board canceled the charter of the Assistance Corporation as of December 31, 2006. Federal Intermediate Credit Bank (FICB) The Agricultural Credits Act of 1923 provided for the creation of 12 FICBs to discount farmers‚Äô short- and intermediate-term notes made by commercial banks, livestock loan companies, thrift institutions, and, beginning in 1933, Production Credit Associations. On July 6, 1988, 11 of the 12 then-existing FICBs merged with the Federal Land Banks in their respective districts to form Farm Credit Banks. The mergers were required by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. The last remaining FICB, the FICB of Jackson, merged with the FCB of Columbia, which has since been renamed AgFirst Farm Credit Bank on October 1, 1993. 1921 newspaper ad for loans to farmers available under the program. Federal Land Bank (FLB) The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 provided for the establishment of 12 FLBs to provide long-term mortgage credit to farmers and ranchers, and later to rural homebuyers. On May 20, 1988, the FLB of Jackson was placed in receivership and liquidated. On July 6, 1988, the 11 remaining FLBs merged with the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in their respective districts to form Farm Credit Banks. The mergers were required by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Federal Land Bank Association (FLBA) An FLBA was a lending agent for a Federal Land Bank and later the Farm Credit Bank and the Agricultural Credit Bank. FLBAs originated and serviced long-term mortgage loans to farmers and ranchers, and to rural residents for housing. FLBAs did not own the loan assets but originated loans on behalf of the Federal Land Banks/FCS banks with which they were affiliated. As of October 1, 2000, there are no longer any FLBAs in the FCS. They either merged with Production Credit Associations to form ACAs or became direct-lender Federal Land Credit Associations when Farm Credit Banks transferred their authority to make long-term mortgage loans to their affiliated FLBAs. Production Credit Association (PCA) The Farm Credit Act of 1933 authorized farmers to organize PCAs to deliver short- and intermediate-term loans to farmers and ranchers, and to rural residents for housing. A PCA also makes loans to these borrowers for basic processing and marketing activities, and to farm-related businesses. A PCA obtains funds from an FCS bank to lend to its members. PCAs own their loan assets. All present- day PCAs are now subsidiaries of ACAs. 1980s Agricultural crisis In the 1980s, the United States faced a major farm crisis. With low crop prices, and the value of farm land falling, many farmers were unable to service their debts. This severely affected the Farm Credit System, which experienced large losses beginning in 1986. Investor confidence in FCS bonds declined, with increased spreads over U.S. treasury debt. The federal government responded by amending the Farm Credit Act of 1971 in 1985 and 1986, and then enacting the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 to help strengthen the FCS.Financial Crises of the 1970s and 1980s: Causes, Developments, and Government Responses. CRS Report For Congress April 28, 1989  Criticism  The Farm Credit System and a number of FCS banks have faced criticism of their practices. In March 2016, the FCS Funding Corporation disclosed that 45.5% of total FCS taxpayer- subsidized loans outstanding as of year-end 2015 had been borrowed by only 4,458 borrowers. Critics, such as the American Bankers Association, also charge that FCS banks only make large loans (more than $1 million) and are making loans with tax-emempt earnings that have almost nothing to do with farming, such as to Verizon Communications and Cracker Barrel; defenders justified CoBank ACB loans to Verizon and Frontier Communications because they provide landline voice service, Internet and wireless access and other services to rural areas.

Profile The Syria Times was published by Tishreen Organization for Press and Publishing, a government-owned company that publishes the leading Arabic daily Tishreen. As of 2000, these two newspapers had a circulation of 5,000 and 60,000, respectively. Condemnation of Iraq war In March and April 2003, The Syria Times received some international attention due to its harsh condemnation of the US-led war against Iraq, well in line with the official Syrian discourse in the debates of the UN Security Council. For instance, The Irish Times noticed that ‚ÄúThe Syria Times attacked Bush's \\"unholy war\\" and his \\"imperialist strategy to control the Arab oil-rich region‚Äù‚Äù. In an interview with The Middle East magazine, Fuad Mardood, editor of The Syria Times, said: ‚ÄúI cannot imagine that there is anyone in Syria who wants to attack our policy (‚Ä¶) You can find people who have personal motives who may attack the system, but it is only to achieve personal goals.‚Äù In late May 2008, Mohammad Agha was released from his position as editor-in-chief of Syria Times. The decision was apparently made by the Minister for Information Mohsen Bilal. A history of differences between the two had been reported. The official reason for Agha's termination was failure to catch a mistake regarding the caption accompanying a photograph. Closure On 8 June 2008, The Syria Times was closed for an indefinite period of time. Various reasons were given, chief amongst them issues relating to the contract for the new editor-in-chief. A report on the viability of the Syria Times was delivered to the People's Assembly (the Syrian parliament) in July, and assistance was requested to restart the newspaper. Following lengthy delays, a 2-year agreement (since extended) was signed with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to assist the newspaper to the tune of $900,000 used for analysis, restructuring, training and equipment.\\"Support to the Syria Times Newspaper\\" UNDP Syria No official date has been set for recommencing publishing of the Syria Times.

The launching coincided with the country's celebrations of the 39th anniversary of the Liberation War of October, led by the late President Hafez al-Assad. On the importance of the re-launching the \\"Syria Times\\" e-newspaper, Minister al- Zou'bi said: \\"We are in need for new tools to communicate with English- speaking communities, as to address the people of these communities and present our views and causes the way they understand, and not the way we want to.\\" Minister Al-Zou'bi asserted that the launching of this e-newspaper is not a kind of political or media luxury, but is an urgent need to communicate and interact with the other in complete transparency, accuracy and credibility. The Minister underlined the need to make a success of the \\"Syria Times\\", so as to achieve its hoped-for goal and to attain wide circulation by publishing it in different languages.\\" Minister Al-Zou'bi asserted the need to restore the paper copy of the newspaper since this kind of publications still have their own readers. \\"I think this is very important to convey our media message to wider categories of readers.\\" the minister concluded. Director General of al- Wehda Press Foundation, Khalaf al-Meftah, expressed hope that the re-launching of the Syria Times would be a further step forward by the Syrian Media, in continuation of the ongoing tireless media efforts as to disseminate the reality of the events on the ground, and as to expose media outlets of fabrications and lies. On his part, the Syria Times editor-in-chief, Mohammad Abdo Al-Ibrahim, underlined that the daily, at the directive of information minister, Omran al-Zou'bi, would adopt in its media coverage the main principles and ethics of journalism, including those of transparency, credibility, and objectivity.

Background Yossef Tamir practicing javelin throwing as the champion of British Mandate Palestine in this field. Tamir was born in Berdychiv in the Russian Empire (now part of Ukraine) and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1924. He passed through elementary and high school in Petah Tikva and graduated from the Law and Economics School at Tel Aviv University. Between 1935 and 1945 he worked as a journalist for Haaretz, the Palestine Post, Yedioth Ahronoth, Maariv and HaBoker, and was a military correspondent during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He was a member of the Maccabi Sports Movement, and won three bronze medals in the Maccabiah Games. Political career Tamir joined the General Zionists party, and became its general secretary. Between 1965 and 1969 he was a member of the Tel Aviv directorate as head of the Liberal Party faction (a merger of the General Zionists and the Progressive Party). In the 1965 elections Tamir was also elected to the Knesset as member of Gahal, an alliance of the Liberal Party and Herut. Yosef retained his seat in the 1969 election, and again in the 1973 election, before which Gahal had become Likud. After being elected to the Knesset for Likud again in the 1977 election, Tamir broke away from the party and joined the newly formed Shinui, a centrist liberal party. However, he soon left his new party and spent the rest of the Knesset session as an independent MK. He was not returned to the Knesset in the 1981 elections. Environmental activism During his lifetime Tamir founded several environmental organisations: *Council for a Beautiful Israel (1968) *Non- factional Committee for Ecology (1970) *Life and Environment Organization (1975) *Israel Economic Forum on the Environment (1991) He also launched the environmental journal Green Blue and White.

Exams usually take place in March, and their results are known in June or July. Students who show great ability in one field are selected to participate by their teachers and their school principal. Most of the time, no more than one student per high school is allowed to participate in the competition, which requires strong knowledge of college level topics. In the humanities and social sciences, the exams involve one or more essays and last 6 hours. In the sciences, the exams last almost as long and are problem-based. In a given subject, up to 18 awards can be given: * up to 3 Prizes. A student winning a prize takes part in a ceremony held in the main amphitheatre of the Sorbonne University, where he or she is given the diploma and congratulated by the Minister of Education and members of the government. * up to 5 Accessits * up to 10 Regional awards A student who wins any of the above is called a \\"laur√©at du Concours G√©n√©ral\\".

King was born Maria Grazia Morgana Messina in Pleasantville, New York; her parents were \\"from Fiumefreddo di Sicilia, Province of Catania, Sicily, Italy.\\" King is better known as a singer and is given a brief chance to display her vocal skills in the wedding reception scene of The Godfather when she sings the song \\"Luna Mezz'O Mare\\".Vernon Scott (May 3, 1971).

She married Vito Corleone in 1915; they were married for 40 years until Vito's death in 1955. They had four children ‚Äì Sonny, Fredo, Michael and Connie. They also took in Sonny's friend Tom Hagen, who later served as the family consigliere. In the book, Carmela Corleone is portrayed as a traditional Italian immigrant woman who speaks in very broken English. In the movies, however, she speaks fluent English as an adult, with a marked New York accent. In the novel, she develops a close relationship with Michael's girlfriend and future wife, Kay. She is given more expansive dialogue in The Godfather Part II, notably when she confronts her daughter Connie about her behavior early in the film, and when she discusses family life with Michael, who fears that his role as Don of the Corleone criminal empire will cost him his family. Carmela Corleone dies toward the end of the sequel. Carmela was disturbed by Vito's change from a kind, quiet young man to a pragmatic and ruthless criminal. However Carmela seems to forgive Vito for his many crimes, because he remains essentially a good man who is devoted to his family. Devoutly Catholic, Carmela attends Mass every day to pray for her husband's soul to keep him from \\"going down there.\\" In The Godfather Part IIs flashback scenes, the young Carmela is portrayed by Francesca De Sapio. Her first name is almost never mentioned, in either the movies or the book, though it is referenced in the sequel books.

His 1984 film The Boy Who Had Everything was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival. His 1986 film For Love Alone was entered into the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.  Short and feature film career  Stephen Wallace made several short 16mm fiction films and worked at Film Australia as a production assistant and director of documentaries.Danny Torsh, \\"Love Letters and Stephen Wallace\\", Cinema Papers, January 1978 p221-223 Wallace made a series of feature films. His first short feature film was The Love Letters from Teralba Road (1977). His feature directorial debut took place with Stir in 1980, a film based on incarceration and a subsequent Royal Commission. The film proved popular and Wallace stated that it made a profit. In 1984, Wallace directed The Boy Who Had Everything. Wallace's experience of this film was to be one of his first difficult encounters within the directing field; he was unhappy with the casting and found one of the actors hard to work with: > Diane Cilento tried to play working-class, but it just didn't work. Robyn > Nevin wanted to play that part, and I think she should have. Jason Connery > was very young then and he was very nervous about the film and thought it > would ruin his image, and he was never very friendly to me. He did the film, > but he thought I was ruining his career. In 1986, Wallace directed the film adaptation of Christina Stead's novel, For Love Alone. The film was beset with budget and rewriting issues, and Wallace was disappointed by its reception, especially in reviews from feminist and women's magazines. Wallace harboured a regret that he didn't handle the treatment of this film more boldly.David Stratton, \\"Margaret Fink\\", Cinema Papers, May 1986 p42 Wallace made Olive in 1988 and Prisoners of the Sun (also known as Blood Oath) in 1990. For the latter film, Wallace felt the writers were not true to the original story, which rendered the film less interesting than the real-life story. Wallace's final feature film before taking a hiatus from directing was Turtle Beach. Wallace was hired because the financiers who had invested in his movie Blood Oath loved his work and saw him as a good choice. Yet, Wallace said: > I loved the book and I really wanted to make the film. I think in the end > the script really wasn't good enough and I had a terrible run-in with the > producer on it. It was just a nightmare. I wanted to make a film about Asia > again, because I thought Asia was misunderstood in Australia and I thought > the more light we can shed on Asians, the better... But unfortunately in the > film, it all went haywire because the reason to make the film was wrong... > The producers all wanted to make Pretty Woman. I said, \\"It's not Pretty > Woman, it's a film about Asia.\\" I had to fight to get an Indian to play the > Indian; it was a struggle from start to finish. There was plenty of money, > but I kept compromising on it. I kept compromising about the place where the > beach was, about the roughness of the set. I wanted it really rough. Then > there was this whole thing about the disco place, which was actually the > producer's idea, something he'd seen in Thailand... Also the massacre on the > beach. Everyone was worried, the massacre had to be built up, whereas the > massacre was wrong - emotionally and morally wrong. All this was pushed and > I felt I'd lost control of the film. Wallace finished the film. He made his cut but was fired from the film and extra scenes were shot. Wallace was given advice to remove his name from the film but didn't: > I should have taken my name off it. I got advised by my agents not to, but I > should have. I don't feel the film is mine. A lot of the shots are mine, but > extra stuff was shot and my name is on it, so I've got to take > responsibility for it.

At the time, he considered that making this film wrecked his feature film career. In 2014, it was announced that Wallace was directing again. The low budget film, The Body in the Yard, was set to begin shooting on 28 August 2014, with an all-Australian cast.\\"New Film for Screenwise tutor Director Stephen Wallace!\\", Screenwise, 7 July 2014 accessed 14 December 2014 This film is based on an Australian newspaper story Wallace read back in the 1980s or 90s, about the murder by a husband of his wife; the husband buried his murdered wife in the backyard and continued to live with his girlfriend in the same house. Wallace may look to screening in France first, then consider Australia. As at December 2014, the film was still in the editing stage.

Original uses Bull pizzle It is also known, at least since 1523, especially in the combination \\"bull pizzle\\", to denote a flogging instrument made from a bull's penis. It derives from the Low German pesel or Flemish pezel, originally from the Dutch language pees meaning \\"sinew\\". In William Shakespeare's play, Henry IV, Part 1, the character Falstaff uses the term as an insult (Act 2, Scene IV): > 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried neat's tongue, you bull's > pizzle, you stock-fish! In heraldry In heraldry, the term pizzled (or vilen√© in French blazon) indicates the depiction or inclusion of an animate charge's genitalia, especially if colored (or \\"tinctured\\") differently.http://www.heraldica.org/topics/sex.htm (accessed July 13, 2016). Coat of arms of Appenzell, Switzerland; argent, a bear rampant sable armed, langued and pizzled gules The bear in the coat of arms of Appenzell is represented pizzled, and omission of this feature was seen as a grave insult. In 1579, the pizzle was forgotten by the printer of a calendar printed in Saint Gallen, which brought Appenzell to the brink of war with Saint Gallen. Prior to 2007, the lion on the coat of arms of the Nordic Battlegroup featured a pizzle, but in 2007 the commander ruled that the lion's penis had to be removed. Since civilian women are often sexually abused in the war zones of the world, they did not consider the depiction of a penis appropriate on a uniform worn into battle. However, this decision has been questioned by some Swedish heraldists, including heraldic artist Vladimir Sagerlund, who has asserted that coats of arms containing lions without a penis were historically given to those who had betrayed the Swedish Crown. Modern uses=Paramilitary use in World War II Pizzles were widely used as late as 1944 by local paramilitary units on the Eastern Front, usually as a disciplinary measure against arrested or bullied civilians.Ern≈ë Sz√©p, The Smell of Humans: A Memoir of the Holocaust in Hungary, translated by John B√°tki (Budapest: Corvina and Central European University Press, 1994) Animal consumption Pizzles, or bully sticks, are mostly produced today as chewing treats for dogs. Bull penises are dried, in open air or in ovens. Commercial vendors will drain the blood and urine from the organ prior to drying in order to decrease the smell of these when chewed by dogs. These are called \\"odor free\\" bully sticks. \\"Junior\\" bully sticks are thinner ones that are made from castrated male (steer). Glue The pizzle of a bull was commonly rendered for use as glue. Human consumption In addition to being used as a dog treat, pizzles are also eaten by humans for their purported health benefits (according to traditional Chinese medicine) such as being low in cholesterol and high in protein, hormones, and vitamins, and minerals such as calcium and magnesium, although little empirical evidence supports these claims. Pizzles for human consumption are prepared either by freezing or by drying. Scottish deer pizzles are thought to boost stamina and were used by Chinese athletes at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pizzles can be served in soup, and if they have been dried they can be turned into a paste. Pizzles may also be mixed with alcoholic beverages or simply thawed (if frozen) and eaten. In Jamaica, bull pizzles are referred to as \\"cow cods\\" and are eaten as cow cod soup. Like many pizzle-based foods, cow cod soup is claimed to be a male aphrodisiac.

The field has also been called the empirical studies of programming (ESP). It covers research into computer programmers' cognition, tools and methods for programming-related activities, and programming education. Psychologically, computer programming is a human activity which involves cognitions such as reading and writing computer language, learning, problem solving, and reasoning. History The history of psychology of programming dates back to late 1970s and early 1980s, when researchers realized that computational power should not be the only thing to be evaluated in programming tools and technologies, but also the usability from the users.Jorma Sajaniemi.

These destinations include refining the use of current languages, improving present and future languages, developing special purpose languages, and improving tools and methods. Two important workshop series have been devoted to psychology of programming in the last two decades: the Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP), based primarily in the US, and the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), having a European character. ESP has a broader scope than pure psychology in programming, and on the other hand, PPIG is more focused in the field of PoP. However, PPIG workshops and the organization PPIG itself is informal in nature, It is group of people who are interested in PoP that comes together and publish their discussions. Goals and purposes It is desirable to achieve a programming performance such that creating a program meets its specifications, is on schedule, is adaptable for the future and runs efficiently. Being able to satisfy all these goals at a low cost is a difficult and common problem in software engineering and project management. By understanding the psychological aspects of computer programming, we can better understand how to achieve a higher programming performance, and to assist programmers to produce better software with less error. Research methods Some methods which one can use to study the psychological aspects of computer programming include introspection, observation, experiment, and qualitative research.

Ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (from 1569 part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth) actively participated in the broad European Renaissance. The multinational Polish state experienced a period of cultural growth thanks in part to a century without major wars, aside from conflicts in the sparsely-populated eastern and southern borderlands. The Reformation spread peacefully throughout the country (giving rise to the Polish Brethren), and living conditions improved, cities grew, and exports of agricultural products enriched the population, especially the nobility (szlachta), who gained dominance in the new political system of Golden Liberty.  Overview  The Renaissance movement, whose influence originated in Italy, spread throughout Poland roughly in the 15th and 16th century. Many Italian artists arrived in the country welcomed by Polish royalty, including Francesco Fiorentino, Bartholommeo Berecci, Santi Gucci, Mateo Gucci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and others, including thinkers and educators such as Filip Callimachus, merchants such as the Boner family and the Montelupi family, and other prominent personalities who immigrated to Poland since the late 15th century in search of new opportunities. Most of them settled in Krak√≥w, the Polish capital until 1611. Jan Kochanowski, poet and prose writer, with his beloved daughter The Renaissance values of the dignity of man and power of his reason were applauded in Poland.Michael J. Miko≈õ, Polish Renaissance Literature: An Anthology. Ed. Michael J. Miko≈õ. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1995. Cultural Background Many works were translated into Polish and Latin from classical Latin, Greek and Hebrew, as well as contemporary languages like Italian. The Cracow Academy, one of the world's oldest universities, enjoyed its Golden Era between 1500 and 1535, with 3,215 students graduating in the first decade of the 16th century ‚Äì a record not surpassed until the late 18th century. The period of Polish Renaissance, supportive of intellectual pursuits, produced many outstanding artists and scientists. Among them were Nicolaus Copernicus who in his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium presented the heliocentric theory of the universe, Maciej of Miech√≥w, author of Tractatus de duabus Sarmatis... ‚Äì the most accurate up to date geographical and ethnographical account of Eastern Europe; Bernard Wapowski, a cartographer whose maps of that region appeared in Ptolemy's Geography; Marcin Kromer who in his De origine et rebus gestis Polonorum libri... described both the history and geography of Poland; Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, a philosopher concerned with governance; Miko≈Çaj Rej who has popularized the use of Polish language in poetry; and Jan Kochanowski, whose poems in Polish language elevated him to the ranks of the most prominent Polish poets.Michael J. Miko≈õ, Polish Renaissance Literature: An Anthology. Ed. Michael J. Miko≈õ. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1995. Literary Background Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium Young Poles, especially sons of nobility (szlachta), who graduated from any one of over 2,500 parish schools, gymnasiums and several academies (Cracow Academy, Wilno Academy, Zamo≈õƒá Academy), often traveled abroad to complete their education. Polish thinkers, like Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, Johannes Dantiscus or Jan ≈Åaski maintained contacts with leading European philosophers of the Renaissance, such as Thomas More, Erasmus and Philip Melanchthon. Poland not only partook in the exchange of major cultural and scientific ideas and developments of Western Europe, but also spread Western heritage eastwards among East Slavic nations. For example, printing process, Latin language and art with the syllabic versification in poetry, especially in Belarus and Ukraine (through Kyiv-Mohyla Academy), from where it was transmitted to Russia (Duchy of Moscow), which began to increase its ties with western Europe in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion of Rus. The first four printed Cyrillic books in the world were published in Krak√≥w, in 1491, by printer Szwajpolt Fiol. King Sigismund I the Old and bishop Piotr Tomicki kneeling before St. Stanis≈Çaw, a leaf form the Hours of Sigismund I by Stanis≈Çaw Samostrzelnik, 1535 Incentives for development of art and architecture were many. King Sigismund I the Old, who ascended to the throne in 1507, was a sponsor of many artists, and begun a major project - under Florence architect Bartolommeo Berrecci - of remaking the ancient residence of the Polish kings, the Wawel Castle, into a modern Renaissance residence. Sigismund's zeal for Renaissance was matched not only by his son, Sigismund II Augustus, but by many wealthy nobles and burghers who also desired to display their wealth, influence and cultural savvy. In 1578, chancellor Jan Zamoyski begun construction of the ideal Renaissance city, sponsoring the creation of Zamo≈õƒá (a city named after him), which soon became an important administrative, commercial and educational town of Renaissance Poland. Two largest contemporary Polish cities - Krak√≥w (which attracted many Italian architects) and Danzig (which attracted mostly architects from Germany and the Netherlands) - likely gained the most in the era, but many other cities also spotted new Renaissance constructions. Renaissance painting was introduced in Poland by many immigrant artists, like Lucas Cranach, Hans D√ºrer and Hans von Kulmbach, and practiced by such Polish painters as Marcin Kober (a court painter of king Stefan Batory). The works of the portraitists created an impressive gallery, particularly representative of those who could afford to be immortalized in them. Portrait of Queen Anna Jagiellon of Poland by Martin Kober, 1576 The centre of musical culture was the royal residence at Krak√≥w, where the royal court welcomed many foreign and local performers. The most significant works of the Renaissance in Poland include compositions, usually for lute and organs, both vocal and instrumental, from dances, through polyphonic music, to religious oratorios and masses. In 1540 by Jan of Lublin released the Tablature, in which he collected most known European organ pieces. Nicolaus Cracoviensis (Miko≈Çaj of Krak√≥w) composed many masses, motets, songs, dances and preludes. Miko≈Çaj Gom√≥≈Çka was the author of musical rendition of Kochanowski's poems (Melodies for the Polish Psalter). The most famous Polish composer was Wac≈Çaw z Szamotu≈Ç, recognized as one of the outstanding Renaissance composers. The first printing press was set up in Krak√≥w in 1473 by the German printer Kasper Straube of Bavaria. Between 1561 and 1600, seventeen printing houses in Poland published over 120 titles a year, with an average edition of 500 copies. The first complete translation of the Bible into Polish was made in 1561 by Jan Leopolita (Leopolita's Bible). About that time, the first Polish orthographic dictionary was published (by Stanis≈Çaw Murzynowski, 1551); grammars and dictionaries also proliferated. The Polish Renaissance was bilingual, the szlachta's speech being a mixture of Polish and Latin, and various authors oscillating among Polish, Latin, and a mixture of the two (Macaronic language). Literature has progressed beyond being dominated by religious themes. They were still present, as seen in numerous bible translations, the most famous being the Wujek's Bible by Jakub Wujek, published in 1599. The nobility, however, cared about more than just religious themes, and the works of Polish renaissance reflected their material and spiritual values (see sarmatism). Contemporary poetry extolled the virtue of manorial life. For example, Rej celebrated life and the position of country's noble, while Kochanowski wrote about the pleasures and beauty of life in the countryside, surrounded by nature. Literary forms varied, from ode, pastorals and sonnets to elegy, satire and romance. In applied sciences, scholars of the period include Jan ≈Åaski (John Lasco), evangelical reformer, Maciej of Miech√≥w (Maciej Miechowita), writer and university teacher, Nicolaus Copernicus, astronomer known in Polish as Miko≈Çaj Kopernik, Wawrzyniec Grzyma≈Ça Go≈õlicki (Laurentius Grimaldius Gosliscius), political thinker and philosopher; Marcin Kromer, writer and geographer; Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski, writer and philosopher; Piotr Skarga, Jesuit political reformer; J√≥zef Stru≈õ, doctor, scientist, mayor of Pozna≈Ñ; and many others.  Notable Polish Renaissance artists  Graves of the last Jagiellons in the Sigismund's Chapel, hailed as \\"the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps\\"The much admired Sigismund Chapel, called \\"the pearl of the Renaissance north of the Alps\\" by foreign scholars. Among the most prominent Polish Renaissance writers and artists, whose accomplishments have become a salient part of Polish curriculum are poets Miko≈Çaj Rej, Jan Kochanowski, Szymon Szymonowic, Miko≈Çaj Sƒôp Szarzy≈Ñski, Andrzej Krzycki and Johannes Dantiscus, writer ≈Åukasz G√≥rnicki, composer Wac≈Çaw z Szamotu≈Ç, composer and singer Miko≈Çaj Gom√≥≈Çka, sculptor Jan Micha≈Çowicz z Urzƒôdowa and painters Stanis≈Çaw Samostrzelnik and Marcin Kober. The artists and architects who settled into Poland and had achieved considerable recognition for their work in the country are: Hans D√ºrer, Hans (S√ºss) von Kulmbach, Mateo Gucci, Santi Gucci, Bartholommeo Berecci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and others.  Architectural trends and periods  Polish Renaissance architecture is divided into three main periods.Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa. Von Sp√§tgotik bis zum Manierismus, Frankfurt af Main, 1960 Wilfried Koch, Style w architekturze, Warsaw 1996 Tadeusz Broniewski, Historia architektury dla wszystkich Wydawnictwo Ossolineum, 1990 Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz, Studia nad dziejami kultury artystycznej p√≥≈∫nego renesansu w Polsce, Toru≈Ñ 1962 The first period (1500-1550) is often called \\"Italian\\", because most of the Renaissance buildings in this time were built by Italian architects invited by Polish nobility mainly from Florence. During the second period (1550-1600), Renaissance style became common, and included influences from Dutch version of the Reinessance as well as beginnings of the Mannerist style. In the third period (1600-1650), Mannerism became popular, with first notable examples of Baroque (see also, Baroque in Poland). First period Wawel Castle's courtyard exemplifies first period of the Polish Renaissance In 1499 Wawel Castle was partially consumed by fire. King Alexander Jagiellon in 1504 appointed Eberhard Rosemberger as the main architect for the renovation. Later, he was replaced by Italian-born Francesco Florentino and, after his death, by Bartolomeo Berrecci and by Benedykt of Sandomierz. As a result of their work the Royal Castle was transformed into a Renaissance residence in Florentine style. In the same period other castles and residences were built or rebuilt in the new style, including Drzewica (built in 1527-1535), Szyd≈Çowiec (rebuilt 1509-1532), Ogrodzieniec (rebuilt 1532-1547) and most notably, Pieskowa Ska≈Ça, rebuilt 1542-1580. In the first period of the Polish Renaissance, churches were still build mostly in the Gothic style. In this time, only new chapels surrounding the old churches were sometimes build in the new style. The most prominent of them, the Sigismund's Chapel at the Wawel Cathedral, was built in 1519-33 by Bartolomeo Berecci. Second period Pozna≈Ñ Town Hall, rebuilt from Gothic style by Giovanni Battista di Quadro, 1550-55 The Renaissance style became most common throughout Poland in its second period. In the northern part of the country, especially in Pomerania and in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), there worked a large group of Dutch-born artists. Renaissance style in other parts of Poland varied under local conditions, producing different substyles in each region. Also, some elements of the new Manierist style were present. Architecture of this period is divided into three regional substyles: \\"Italian\\" ‚Äì mostly in the southern part of Poland, with the most famous artist there being Santi Gucci, the \\"Dutch\\" ‚Äì mostly in Pomerania, and the \\"Kalisz‚ÄìLublin style\\" () (or the \\"Lublin Renaissance\\") in central Poland ‚Äì with most notable examples built in Kalisz, Lublin, and Kazimierz Dolny. All over Poland, new castles were constructed, bearing the new quadrilateral shape enclosing a courtyard, with four towers at the corners. Prominent examples include: the castle at P≈Çakowice (16th century), the castle at Brzeg, (rebuilt from a Gothic stronghold in 1544-60), the castle at Niepo≈Çomice (rebuilt after a fire in 1550-71), the castle at Baran√≥w Sandomierski (built in 1591-1606 by Santi Gucci), and the castle at Krasiczyn. Many cities erected new buildings in the Renaissance style. New Cloth Hall (Sukiennice) in Krak√≥w was built. City halls were built or rebuilt in: Tarn√≥w, Sandomierz, Che≈Çm (demolished) and in Pozna≈Ñ. Also, entire towns were often redesigned. Examples of Renaissance urban planning survived into modern times in Szyd≈Çowiec and Zamo≈õƒá. Green Gate in Gda≈Ñsk, 1612‚Äì14 Examples of Pomeranian Renaissance which developed under the influence of Northern Europe rather than Italy were: Green Gate in Gda≈Ñsk (built in 1564-1568 by Hans Kramer), Upland Gate in Gda≈Ñsk (finished by Willem van den Blocke in 1588), Great Arsenal in Gda≈Ñsk (built in 1602-1606 by Anthonis van Obbergen), and the Old City Hall in Gda≈Ñsk (built in 1587-1595, probably by Anthonis van Obbergen). Characteristic laicization of life during Renaissance and Reformation resulted in only minor development in sacral architecture. Mainly chapels were being built in the Renaissance style, but some churches were also rebuilt including: Cathedral in P≈Çock (rebuilt after fire by architects Zanobi de Gianotis, Cini, Filippo di Fiesole and later again by Giovanni Battista di Quadro); and, the Collegiate in Pu≈Çtusk (rebuilt by John Batista of Venice). Only a few new churches were founded, such as the collegiate church of St. Thomas in Zamo≈õƒá. Third period \\"Armenian houses\\" in Zamo≈õƒá A fire at Wawel and the moving of the capital to Warsaw in 1596 halted the development of Renaissance in Krak√≥w, as well as in Danzig. Also, the rising power of the Jesuits and the Counterreformation gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and a new style ‚Äì the Baroque (see also, Baroque in Poland). The most important example of the ascending Mannerist architecture in Poland is a complex of houses in Kazimierz Dolny and in Zamo≈õƒá.

After a brief custody battle, Terry and Dawn‚Äôs relationship improves and their lives become more stable. In the meantime, Louise discovers that she has feelings for Terry after all and they get together and decide to buy the B&B; from Alan Turner. However, Louise is attracted to newcomer Matthew King and is unable to resist when he starts flirting with her. Soon they begin an affair behind Terry‚Äôs back. It goes on for weeks and Terry finds out when Louise ends their relationship just as they are about to complete the sale of the B&B.; Terry is furious but now that Louise is living with Matthew, he loses interest and realising her mistake, Louise begs him for a second chance but Terry is not interested. He throws himself into work and takes a job as Tom King (Kenneth Farrington)‚Äôs chauffeur. When Bob marries Viv again, Terry spends the night with Jean Hope and they agree it was a one off but eventually reconcile. Terry and Jean are devastated when Dawn is imprisoned for benefit fraud and the trauma brings them back together. They begin a relationship but determined to keep it a secret, Jean flirts with Tom King, but the relationship is exposed when Terry and Jean are caught having sex in public and are arrested. Tom, feeling foolish, sacks them both so they decide to buy the B&B; from Alan Turner. Terry could not afford to buy it when he and Louise split up so Jean agrees to go into business with him, deciding to sell her hotel in Spain. Unfortunately it emerges that she could not afford to go into business with Terry but Louise jumps at the chance, selling her share of The Woolpack to Val Lambert. Jean is unhappy about this but she and Louise eventually come to an agreement. Dawn finds out about Terry and Jean's relationship when she is released from prison and furiously insists that they end it but Jean refuses. Dawn goes to Newquay to think things over and clear her head and when she returns, Dawn tells them that she and T.J are moving to Cornwall. Hurt at the prospect of losing contact with his son, Terry threatens to sue for custody but backs down when he realizes that he is tearing the family apart. On the day Dawn and T.J are due to leave, TJ is with Terry for the day so Dawn could pack but Terry returns T.J later than planned, so he and Dawn miss their flight. While waiting for Terry, Donna, persuades Dawn to go and see her and her husband Marlon's new home at the Kings River development, along with the rest of the village. During the opening there is a huge gas explosion, making the show home collapse, and Dawn dies after suffering internal injuries. Although Terry is sad Dawn has died, he is relieved not to lose his son and gains custody of T.J. Dawn's family, however, are devastated and Dawn's father, Bob, and brother, Jamie (Alex Carter), begin a campaign for justice for the people who died. Jean grows tired of Bob's obsession and asks Terry to talk sense into him. When Tom offers compensation, Jean accepts as she sees it as the Kings admitting liability and plans to leave the country with T.J for a fresh start. When Terry finds out, he races to the airport to stop her but she and T.J leave for Morocco. Terry is devastated. Terry holds a grudge against Tom for losing him contact with his son and when Tom is murdered on Christmas Day 2006, Terry is a prime suspect. Shortly after Tom's death, Terry disappears and returns with T.J a few weeks later after going to Morocco and persuading Jean to give him back. He is questioned by the police as a suspect in the murder investigation but is released without charge. Terry's father, Duke, arrives in Emmerdale in June 2007. Louise had seen Duke Woods appearing as a guest on The Jeremy Kyle Show, speaking out against anti-social young men. Duke's friend, Andrea Hayworth, persuades Terry to ask Duke to visit for a while in the hope they would reconcile. They do not reconcile completely but learn to respect each other a little more. Duke hopes that Terry and Andrea will get together, as they are both single parents. Andrea is keen to embark on a relationship but Terry is not. Terry is scared when T.J is admitted to hospital in 2008 after food poisoning strikes the village and the surrounding area. T.J contracts E coli and a possible cause is Jo Sugden's organic goat cheese. Jo is cleared and Environmental Health tells Jo and Terry that a local supermarket is responsible. Since then, Terry concentrates on looking after his son and his business. After his former girlfriend, Viv Hope is imprisoned for fraud, Terry and Jamie ask Bob and their twins to move in with them. Bob needs company and the twins are company for T.J. Terry later embarks on a relationship with Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop). T.J does not like her at first but comes round eventually. Brenda moves in with Terry and T.J and eventually convinces Terry to sell the B&B; to Eric (Chris Chittell) and Val Pollard. Brenda is later angry with Terry when she discovers that her adopted daughter Gennie had slept with Bob whilst Viv was in prison. Bob had told Terry but Terry lets Bob stay with him and T.J briefly after Viv throws him out. Terry begins work as a limousine driver with Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower). In December 2010, Terry becomes close to Viv again after the shop is burgled numerous times. He helps Viv install a new lock on the flat door and after injuring his hand he looks for a first aid kit and discovers items lost in the burglaries and an alleged mugging Viv claimed had occurred when she had been taking the money from the till to the bank. Terry confronts Viv and she tells him that she faked some of the burglaries and the mugging in order to get Bob's attention as she had been feeling lonely after their split. Terry reassures Viv and she promises never to do anything like that again. Terry later invites Viv over for drinks with him and Brenda and they get on well, much to Brenda's discomfort. After Christmas, Terry encourages Viv to move on from Bob and find a new boyfriend and take up salsa dancing classes again. Viv agrees and asks Terry to come with her as she felt he had been a good dance partner before. Terry agrees and decides not to tell Brenda for fear of her getting the wrong idea. Viv mistakes Terry's friendliness as a sign that he wanted to restart their relationship and on 11 January 2011, when he drops her off at the caf√©, she kisses him. Terry hesitates at first then goes home. He later confides in Bob what happened with Viv and he tells Bob that he intends to set her straight and goes to visit her. Unbeknownst to Terry, Brenda sees him as he enters the caf√©. Viv is waiting in the flat with a bottle of wine and Terry explains to her that they cannot be together as he is with Brenda. He also explains that she is a special friend to him and that he was trying to cheer her up. Viv accepts his explanation and Terry leaves and goes home. Brenda confronts him about his meetings and dance classes with Viv and accuses him of having an affair with her. Terry denies it but before he can tell her the truth, they hear shouts outside and are told the houses are on fire and that they should leave their home in case it spreads. Terry packs a bag and gets T.J ready but Brenda continues to pester him about Viv. Terry takes Brenda and T.J to Carl King (Tom Lister)'s house and goes back to help with the rescue effort. Terry finds out that Viv is trapped in the shop with the twins and he and Bob go into the building to rescue them, despite Brenda begging Terry not to go. Bob gets out safely after rescuing the twins but Terry is not with him. The post office and shop explodes and Terry and Viv are killed. Brenda is devastated when the chief firefighter tells them that the ferocity of the blaze means that he had to remove his men from the building. Brenda breaks down as she comes to terms with the fact that Terry is dead and regrets arguing with him and Bob remarks that both his wife and his best friend have gone.

Running northwest-to-southeast, they form the main watershed between the Huai and Yangtze rivers. The range also marks the boundary between Hubei Province and its neighbors of Henan (to the north) and Anhui (to the east). The western part of Dabie Mountains has a low elevation of only 1,000‚Äì1,300 feet (300‚Äì400 meters), though there are a few peaks rising to 3,000 feet (900 meters). The eastern part is higher, averaging more than 3,300 feet (1,000 meters). The highest peak is Mount Tianzhu at 5,820 feet (1,774 meters), with several others topping 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) including the high Tiantangzhai. Landscape The range is heavily forested (about 85% coverage) and yields valuable bamboo as well as oak, particularly cork oak, making it China's chief cork-producing area. The region is median income, and subsistence agriculture is the heart of its economy with rice and tea predominating. The main transportation route across the higher range is from Macheng in Hubei to Huangchuan in Hunan, through the Huai River valley. The main rail and road crossings go north from Wuhan, through the lower elevations. In 2009, the high-speed Hewu Passenger Railway opened, connecting Hefei (capital of Anhui) with Wuhan (capital of Hubei) along a short direct route. It uses a number of tunnels when crossing the Dabie range. Geology Geologically, the Dabie Mountains are characterized by the occurrence of eclogite-facies ultrahigh- pressure metamorphic rocks. Geographically, the range is a complex, stressed structure, making it and the surrounding area subject to earthquakes. In late 2005, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake centered in the northwest corner of Jiangxi province, just south of Jiujiang on the Yangtze killed at least 15 people, injured hundreds, and left several thousand people homeless. It caused tremors in Qichun County in Hubei province and beyond, even reaching as far as the provincial capital of Wuhan. International Forest Park This scenic park centered on Tiantangzhai is a key tourist attraction in the highest part of the Dabie mountain range. Total area of the park is 300 square kilometers. Located in Hubei province's Luotian County and close to the border with Anhui Province, the park is about 68 kilometers from Luotian town, 140 kilometers from Macheng, 150 kilometers from Huangshi, and 210 kilometers from the Hubei provincial capital, Wuhan.

The remains of the ship, and a modern reconstruction, are on display at the Lat√©nium archeology museum. The boat The Bevaix boat was built from large oak planks and measured in length and around in beam. It is characterized by a flat bottom and the complete absence of a keel or any central plank. Its four principle bottom planks were arranged one besides the other in a way that the first plank forms the stern and the last one forms the bow. The beam of the boat was determined by the addition of L-shaped bilge strakes. These strakes allowed a direct transition between the flat bottom and the sides of the boat. The spaces left between the bilge strakes and the four large bottom planks were filled by two planks with an irregular outline. The purpose of these last planks was to obtain appropriate symmetry of the bottom. The upper strakes, those above the bilge strake, did not survive. However, evidence of caulking, found on the upper edges of the bilge strakes clearly suggests that the sides had been heightened by at least one or two strakes. This, in turn, led to estimates suggesting that the maximum height of the boat was about . Framing Twenty-two pairs of internal frames, also made of oak, were arranged head to tail to give almost vertical sides. All the pairs consisted of two timbers, each made of a single naturally bent timber which was cut from a tree junction (main trunk as floor support, and branch junction as side support). In every case, frames were always installed in pairs covering the whole length of the bottom, but alternatively supporting only one side of the hull. The only exception is a sixth pair, which was a single piece of oak with a mortise cut in the center to function as a mast-step. The framing was fastened to the planks with some 300 iron nails driven from inside. They passed first through the frame, and then the strakes. Any projecting end was clenched at the right angle (double- clenched according to some sources). Caulking The Bevaix boat presents a very distinctive caulking technique, which clearly differentiated it from similar finds of this period from other parts of Europe. It was observed that caulking was consistently present between all the planks of the boat. First, a string was inserted into the seam. Next, this string was covered by layer of mosses, which in turn was held by a wooden lath that was secured with thousands of little caulking nails, inserted into the seams from the outside.

He was the son of classical scholar John Henry Wright and novelist Mary Tappan Wright, and the brother of legal scholar and utopian novelist Austin Tappan Wright. He married Katharine McGiffert Jan. 21, 1921 in New York, N.Y. They had three children: Austin McGiffert Wright, Gertrude Huntington McPherson, and Mary Wolcott Toynbee. Having completed a PhD in history at Harvard University, in 1920 Wright was employed as librarian by the American Geographical Society; between the years of 1920 and 1956 he also served as an AGS editor, personal academic contributor, and eventually director. As a result of his prolific academic and professional life, three main themes have emerged in John K. Wright‚Äôs published works. These include: the overlapping of academic disciplines (mainly history) with geography, the power of the mind and the supernatural realm in creating subjectivity in geographic research, and the importance of sharing academic knowledge. Geographic subjectivity While at one point the discipline of geography ignored the influence of subjectivity in human and physical patterns, John Kirtland Wright brought to the forefront the significance of the mind and the imagination in affecting scientific research. Specifically, he stressed the duality of both the mind‚Äôs reality and of mental, often transcendental, images. Included in this arena of study were his interests in geographical cosmogony and cosmography, which pertained to the theological realm of the divine, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs invisible creation,‚Äù and the emotional bonds between people and places, which he then compared to the physical realm of land surface, climate, and cartography (Wright 1928). History of geography Wright was highly interested in the history of geography and the importance of accurate geographic archival records. He discovered and documented the influences of various religious perspectives on geography, with a very keen interest in Gothic and medieval representations that signified both divine and earthly geographic beauty (Wright 1965). In addition, he wrote prolifically on the Greek and Roman geographic influences, largely pertaining to the fifteenth- century map of the world by Giovanni Leardo (Wright,AGS,1928). This was the second oldest map that was given to the AGS in 1906, dated in the 15th century. Wright‚Äôs historic and cartographic fascination was sparked by the unusual, detailed features of the map, including a calendar encompassing the center image, and by the concept it depicted of the earth‚Äôs surface before the actual discovery of America; Leardo‚Äôs known world includes Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and Europe. Greek and Roman sources were used for the making of the map, specifically including Greek notions that the earth existed as a flat disk. The document lacks the evocative drawings seen in many other medieval maps that were primarily used to fill blank map space (drawings mostly of animals.) Lastly, Leardo features Jerusalem as the city center (Wright, AGS, 1928). Ultimately, Wright indicates that the blurring of the fields of history and geography has much significance, as each subject relies on the other for accuracy (Wright, Henry Holt, 1928.) After retiring as director from the American Geographical Society, Wright continued his quest for historic elucidation by writing on the history of the Society and its connection to the development of geography (Light 1950). Wright coined the term choropleth map in 1938, although the mapping technique itself was first used by Charles Dupin in 1826. Wright cautioned against the use of choropleth maps, instead espousing the virtues of the dasymetric map. Nine years later, in 1947, Wright introduced the notion of geosophy, \`the study of geographical knowledge from any or all points of view. To geography what historiography is to history, it deals with the nature and expression of geographical knowledge both past and present' (Wright 1947).

A radio and television pioneer, she founded King Broadcasting Company, a major owner of broadcast stations in Seattle, Washington. She was the first woman in the United States to buy and manage a television station. Birth and early life Bullitt was born Dorothy Frances Stimson in Seattle in 1892, four years after Washington became a state, to C. D. Stimson, a lumber and real estate magnate, and his wife Harriet. Wealthy throughout her childhood and early adulthood, in 1918 she married A. Scott Bullitt, a lawyer and aspiring politician 14 years her senior. Scott Bullitt, a member of a prominent Kentucky family, became a prominent Democrat and friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was scheduled to place Roosevelt's name in nomination for the U.S. presidency at the 1932 Democratic National Convention when he died of liver cancer, leaving Dorothy a widow at the age of 40. She attended the convention as a delegate in her late husband's place, and presented a plank outlawing child labor for the party's platform. After Scott's death, Dorothy Bullitt hired a lawyer and took personal charge of her family's real estate holdings. Her father had bequeathed her a considerable number of properties in downtown Seattle, but it was the height of the Great Depression, and the Bullitt properties were losing lessees rapidly as businesses failed and their owners moved out. Working in the almost exclusively male business world, and despite knowing next to nothing about real estate at the time of her husband's death, Bullitt personally restored the family's real estate business to financial health. An increasingly prominent member of Seattle's business community, Bullitt became a member of a number of corporate boards and a regent of the University of Washington, and was named Seattle's First Citizen in 1959. King Broadcasting In 1947, Bullitt bought a small AM radio station, KEVR. She immediately applied to the Federal Communications Commission to change the station's call letters to KING (for King County, Washington), but KING was already registered to an old merchant ship, the SS Watertown. Undaunted, Bullitt negotiated with the freighter's owner and acquired the letters. (According to legend, Bullitt personally rowed out to the freighter with a bottle of champagne to meet the captain, who didn't care what call letters he used and asked only that Bullitt make a donation to his church.) The following year, Bullitt received a license for an FM station, KING-FM, and used it to broadcast classical music, her favorite. In 1949, Bullitt purchased an eight-month-old television station, KRSC-TV, and renamed it KING-TV. As the only television station in the Northwest, KING had its choice of programming from all four networks, NBC, CBS, DuMont, and ABC. But as more stations came on the air following the lifting of the FCC's construction freeze, they peeled away KING's network affiliations, leaving KING with the then-poor-performing ABC. KING-TV became an NBC station in 1959 after Bullitt persuaded the more successful network to switch its affiliation from rival station KOMO-TV. KING-TV remains an NBC affiliate today. Bullitt turned the presidency of King Broadcasting, as the company was called, over to her son Charles Stimson \\"Stim\\" Bullitt in 1961, remaining on the board as chairperson for several years thereafter. Dorothy and Stimson both believed strongly that the stations of King Broadcasting should serve the public, and not just be driven by ratings and revenue. At Bullitt's insistence, KING-TV built one of the first local TV news operations in the country, and through the 1950s and 1960s the station's news programming earned a national reputation for quality, on the strength of its locally produced documentaries and tough investigative journalism. Through the influence of the Bullitts and King Broadcasting executive Ancil Payne, KING-TV and its sister stations developed a corporate culture characterized by political liberalism, expressed through broadcast editorials and a dedication to the Bullitts' notion of public service. In 1952, Senator Joseph McCarthy threatened to have KING-TV's license revoked after the station barred the senator from delivering an allegedly libelous attack on the air. In 1966, Stimson Bullitt himself made the only televised appearance of his career when he delivered an impassioned and controversial editorial against the Vietnam War, long before the American public as a whole began to turn against the conflict's prosecution. All of the King Broadcasting television stations including KING-TV, KREM-TV, KTVB and KGW-TV traditionally ended their broadcast days with the playing of the Old 100th set to nature scenes, produced for them by the Religious Broadcasting Commission of the state councils of churches (and later Churches of the Northwest). Death and legacy Dorothy Bullitt died on June 27, 1989 at the age of 97. She was interred at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park. By the time of her death, King Broadcasting owned six television stations in four states, and radio stations in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco, as well as a cable TV company, broadcast sales companies, and mobile production facilities; its estimated $300‚Äì400 million market value made it one of the most valuable privately held media companies on the West Coast. Bullitt bequeathed ownership of King Broadcasting to her daughters, Priscilla \\"Patsy\\" Bullitt Collins and Harriet Bullitt, who sold the properties to the Providence Journal Company in 1991 in a sale brokered by Ancil Payne. All three Bullitt children have donated substantial amounts of money and time to the Bullitt Foundation, founded by Dorothy in 1952 with a mission to protect the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest, and to other charitable organizations and causes. Patsy Bullitt Collins, who died in 2003, was ranked 16th in that year's \\"Slate 60\\" list of the nation's largest charitable donors for bequests to the Nature Conservancy, CARE USA, and the Trust for Public Land totaling $71.1 million. Today, King Broadcasting is a subsidiary of TEGNA, based in McLean, Virginia. Bullitt's original KING AM station changed owners, frequencies, and call letters several times in the 1990s; its old 1090 kHz frequency is currently occupied by progressive talk station KFNQ. When the Bullitt sisters sold the company to the Providence Journal in 1991, they donated KING-FM to a nonprofit organization formed by the Seattle Opera, the Seattle Symphony, and the Corporate Council for the Arts (now ArtsFund). In 2011, the stakeholder organizations and the board of KING-FM shifted KING from a commercial station to a nonprofit in its own right. KING-FM still broadcasts classical music in Seattle today, having never changed format since its founding in 1948.

History Electric Banana Band was formed as a response to the success of Trazan & Banarne, a highly acclaimed Swedish children's television programme, also produced by two of the band members, Lasse √Öberg and Klasse M√∂llberg. The band takes on a jungle theme, partially borrowing elements from The Phantom, a widely popular comic in Sweden, as well as Tarzan. Their jungle theme included both their costumes, designed to reflect the nicknames of the lineup, as well as the songs, which usually had nature-inspired themes. Despite being mainly a studio band, the band does some occasional touring, mainly at free events as the members of the band are not dependent upon the success of the band. In the 2003 film Smala Sussie the band was mentioned several times and became somewhat of a comedic plot element. The band competed in Melodifestivalen 2006 with their song Kameleont (Chameleon).

History Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs founder, Isaac Gilman, emigrated from Ukraine and began working in the paper manufacturing business in 1881. In 1921, Gilman Paper Company purchased the Fitzdale Paper Company. From 1921 to 1924, a period of major renovations and construction occurred. The steam plant, built in 1901, was demolished and replaced with four Stirling boilers and a 225 foot-high chimney. Two buildings were erected to house the paper machines and the grocery bag department. During this period, most of the employee residences in the nearby village were built and provided with fire, sewer, and water systems. Over the next decade, Gilman Paper Company expanded manufacturing in the paper converting field, opening a Kraft bag department, a gummed tape department, and a department that produced twisted yarn made from paper. In the 1940s, Isaac Gilman's son Charles Gilman built an additional mill in St. Mary's, Georgia. The company was capable of producing 2.6 million pounds of paper per day, employed 1,100 workers and 1,500 independent contractors, with headquarters at 111 West 50th Street, New York. Gilman Paper Company grew to become the largest privately held paper company in the United States. In addition to the pulp mill in St. Marys, Georgia, Gilman Paper Company acquired extensive timber lands in Florida and Georgia, including 7,400 acres in Nassau County, Florida that would become White Oak Conservation. A short-line railroad was built to haul trees, pulp, and paper. In 1947, Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs Vermont mill was sold to Georgia- Pacific Corporation. At the death of Charles Gilman in 1967, the company was run by his two sons, Charles (Chris) Gilman, Jr. and Howard Gilman. The article, The Fall of The House of Gilman, published in Forbes Magazine in 2003, described Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs management under Charles and Howard Gilman: > Their relationship became strained, riven by jealousy and bitterness over > control of the company, according to friends and family. In 1979 their > mother, Sylvia, sided with Chris, disinheriting Howard and leaving Chris > with control of the business. With the assistance of attorney Bernard D. Bergreen, Howard Gilman was able to reinstate his stake in Gilman Paper Company. At the death of Charles Gilman, Jr., in January 1982, Howard Gilman bought the balance of the company from Charles's estate. Howard Gilman later died of a heart attack at his White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida in 1998. At the time of his death, the Gilman family fortune was estimated to be $1.1 billion in assets, with $550 million in debts. The paper mill was subsequently sold to Durango Products of Mexico. In 2002, Durango entered into bankruptcy, and the paper mill was shut down in September, 2002.  Environmental and legal record = St. Marys, Georgia  Gilman Paper Company began operation of a mill in St. Marys, Georgia in 1941. By the 1970s, the location produced 900 tons of paper a day. Of the 4,000 residents of St. Marys, Gilman Paper Company employed between 1,500 and 2,000 individuals. At its peak, the mill‚Äôs manager, George W. Brumley, reported: > Gilman Paper Company is the only major Georgia industry south of Brunswick > and east of Waycross. It can safely be stated that not less than 75 percent > of the economy of Camden County is directly dependent on Gilman Paper > Company. Of those employed by Gilman Paper Company was Georgia State Representative Robert W. Harrison, who served as the attorney for the St. Marys mill; the attorney for the surrounding cities of St. Marys, Kingsland, and Folkston; the attorney for the local school board and the hospital authority; and the attorney for Camden and Charlton Counties. Disputes that arose over Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs obligation to pay city and county taxes were resolved by Robert Harrison, who spoke on behalf of Gilman Paper Company, the city, and the county. Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs 1958 tax arrangement with the city of St. Marys guaranteed that the valuation placed on its assets for property tax purposes remained frozen at its 1958 level. The agreement also exempted Gilman Paper Company from paying city tax on any new land purchases. The mill‚Äôs value was listed on the St. Marys 1970 tax digest as $3 million, in contrast to the Camden County digest, which required approval by the state of Georgia, and placed the value at $15.4 million. = Statewide and national publicity = In 1970, members of Ralph Nader‚Äôs ‚ÄúNader‚Äôs Raiders‚Äù were located in nearby Savannah, Georgia conducting the study, The Water Lords, regarding the influence of large companies on the pollution, tax evasion, and economy of surrounding areas. Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs labor union president, Wyman Westberry, contacted the project‚Äôs members to bring attention to the 18 million gallons of wastewater the mill generated daily and was discharging into the St. Marys River without treatment. In May 1972, Ralph Nader associates, Harrison Wellford and Peter Schuck, published an article in Harper's Magazine about Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs St. Marys location, titled Democracy and the Good Life in a Company Town. Later that spring, Mike Wallace and the film crew of CBS Evening News 60 Minutes visited St. Marys to interview the mill's manager, George W. Brumley, and report on Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs tax arrangements and involvement in local politics. Newsweek also featured a column detailing Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs presence in St. Marys, Georgia. During the September 1970 primary election for the office of the Georgia state representative from the 66th District, local physician and Camden County resident, Carl Drury, successfully campaigned against Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs attorney and incumbent state legislator, Robert W. Harrison. However, in October 1970, ten days before the general election, Carl Drury was approached by a Gilman Paper Company employee with an accusation of medical misconduct. Carl Drury was informed that the accusation would be withdrawn if he would agree to end his campaign. Carl Drury refused to end his campaign, his medical license was suspended, and a grand jury was convened to investigate the charges. Nonetheless, Carl Drury won the general election and took office as state legislator in February 1971. The grand jury issued a report clearing Carl Drury of the charges, after investigation revealed that the eyewitness affidavit had been signed in the office of opponent Robert W. Harrison by an individual who claimed never to have read it. After winning the election, state representative Carl Drury requested investigation of Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs affairs, ranging from taxes to pollution control. The director of the Georgia Watershed Protection Branch ordered Gilman Paper Company to increase its anti-pollution efforts. The Georgia attorney general ruled that the tax arrangement between Gilman Paper Company and St. Marys was unconstitutional. The legislature passed a law requiring cities to use the county tax valuations, which are approved by the state, in determining city taxes. Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs annual taxes in St. Marys rose from $45,000 to $227,000. A federal grand jury was convened to investigate irregularities in the county‚Äôs politics. Following the increased environment regulation, tax assessments, and negative publicity in 1972, a Gilman Paper Company supervisor, William (Tommy) Thomas, offered fellow mill employee, Lawrence Brown, $50,000 to kill the labor union president, Wyman Westberry. According to his later testimony, Lawrence Brown never intended to follow-through with the contract, but instead warned Wyman Westberry of the solicitation. Westberry and Brown drove across the state line to Florida, where they contacted the FBI. The FBI and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation provided Lawrence Brown with covert listening devices to record his conversations. Lawrence Brown proceeded to meet with George W. Brumley, Vice President and resident manager of the Gilman Paper Company; Robert W. Harrison, longtime attorney, former legislator, and local counsel for Gilman Paper Company; and William (Tommy) Thomas, an employee of Gilman. On the evidence gathered, a federal grand jury convened to take testimony about the murder plot in May 1972. During Lawrence Brown‚Äôs testimony, he repudiated his story and stated that the account of solicitation had been a mistake. After release, Brown continued to express that he was forced to renounce his story from fear of the Gilman Paper Company executives. By summer 1972, Lawrence Brown was reported missing. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran the front page story for September 19, 1972, Offered $1,500 to Kill ‚Äì Now He‚Äôs Missing. October 15, 1975, the United States grand jury, sitting at Savannah, indicted George W. Brumley, Vice President and resident manager of the Gilman Paper Company at St. Marys, Georgia; Robert W. Harrison, longtime attorney, former legislator, and local counsel for Gilman Paper Company; and William (Tommy) Thomas, an employee of Gilman. A nine day jury trial resulted in the conviction of all three defendants on all pending counts, including conspiracy to commit murder. Gilman Paper Company‚Äôs mill in St. Marys, Georgia was the subject of the CBS Evening News 60 Minutes documentary Company Town, released in 1972. The film alleges that improper waste disposal, political corruption, and tax arrangements by the Gilman Paper Company resulted in the civil right infringement of the residents of St. Marys, Georgia and employees of the mill.

It was the home of the Joseph Bryan family, who followed Daniel Boone through the Cumberland Gap, and became an early settler and horseman of this region. History The history of Waveland begins with the Boone and Bryan families. The two families met in the Yadkin River Valley, North Carolina, when the Boones moved onto the land next to the Bryan family. It was said that the Bryans outfitted several of the Boones hunting trips. Eventually William Bryan married Daniel Boone's sister, Mary Boone. William and Mary had a son, Daniel Boone Bryan.Tapp, p. 3 Daniel Boone surveyed the land that he would give to his nephew, Daniel Boone Bryan, who was a renowned historian, frontiersman, and poet. The area surveyed was about about six miles from present-day downtown Lexington, Kentucky. Daniel Boone Bryan Daniel Boone Bryan settled the land around Waveland by 1786. The name Waveland came from the waves that were visible when the wind blew the fields of grain and hemp surrounding the house. The area was once the home of the biggest hemp and rope producers of the nation. When Daniel Boone Bryan moved to what is now Waveland, he built a small stone cabin. The Waveland mansion was constructed between the fall of 1844 and late 1848. Joseph Bryan had the house built \\"to please his father\\" according to a letter written by his son Elijah in 1845. Bryan constructed his office with seven doors, each for a different part of his life. There was a door that connected to the formal dining room, where he and guests would eat. Another door, which locked from his office, was to two upstairs rooms where he would allow travelers to stay if they paid him. He made sure he was able to lock them in for safety reasons. The travelers could not leave their room unless Joseph unlocked the door, meaning he was safe from being robbed or attacked by them at night. Another door led to the fields where the slaves worked. This meant easier communication with them when necessary. Another door led out to the road where businessmen would often travel in to see him. Being an important and successful businessman in Kentucky, he often was visited by others. One door lead into the family parlor, where he could be with his children. The remaining two doors were closets, which were used as safes.Christen interview Bryan was at once a gunsmith, having a large shop and employing twenty five men at one time; manufacturer of saltpeter and gunpowder; operator of a gristmill, a blacksmith shop, Baptist church, a female seminary, a distillery and a paper mill.Tapp, p. 5 He was able to manage all of these successfully. He and his wife Elizabeth had twelve children. Joseph Bryan Bryan's son, Joseph, inherited Waveland and made the most memorable piece of this historic site. Joseph Bryan's wife convinced him to construct a more memorable and beautiful home than his father had built. He tore down the old stone cabin two years after his father's death so that he could build the large, opulent house that his wife wanted. To reduce construction costs, Bryan constructed the stairway rail using flat pieces of wood instead of rounded ones. Although his wife wanted expensive marble baseboards, Bryan used cheaper stones and had them painted to look like marble.Christen Interview Proof of how successful the Bryans' businesses were was that he was able to construct most of the house using only his businesses and materials on his land; the lumber he used came from Waveland plantations, the wrought iron was made at the Waveland blacksmith, the bricks used in the buildings were made from some clay gathered on the land, which was then burned on site. The resources that were not at Waveland were the stones that were used for the foundation of the house and also for some decorative work. The stones that were needed were quarried and dressed at Tyrone on the Kentucky River and moved to Waveland.Kentucky Parks Online Bryan decided to build a classic Greek Revival structure. Inspired by the work of Lexington architect John McMurtry, Bryan hired Washington Allen, a well-known Lexington contractor, to oversee the construction of his new home.Kentucky State Parks Online The house contained fourteen high ceiling rooms, which made them each cooler in the summer, as heat rises. The main doorway of the mansion is considered to be an exact replica of the doorway of the north entrance to the Erechtheion at the Acropolis in Athens. The house also contains a porch on either side, to give a view of the beautiful surrounding country side, as well as a spacious hall and a portico. Throughout their time at Waveland, the Bryans kept slaves. There were thirteen slaves, three women and ten men. The women were to keep the house clean as well as do the cooking. Margaret Cartmell Bryan, Joseph's wife, made all of the clothing for all of the slaves and the Bryan family. The invention of the sewing machine significantly reduced the time it took her to make clothing. The male slaves were in charge of the farm. Each one had to keep of land. In order to save time traveling, the Bryans allowed the slaves to build houses on the property they kept. The slaves at Waveland enjoyed freedoms that were uncommon for other slaves of the day. When they were not working, they were allowed to hunt for themselves. They were also allowed to buy and sell at the local markets, keeping any profits for themselves. Joseph Bryan also allowed the slaves to keep weapons. The slave quarters were two bricks thick, making them better insulated than many other homes in Kentucky. Joseph Bryan supported the Confederacy during the Civil War and gave them supplies such as horses and food produced on his land. When Union authorities discovered this, they sought to arrest him. Bryan fled to Canada, returning years later when the war had ended. As a result of the war, the slaves at Waveland were emancipated, but they chose to stay and continue working for Bryan, who paid them for their labor, but charged them rent. Joseph Henry Bryan Joseph Henry Bryan, one of Bryan's eleven children, lost his house, so he and his wife and children moved back into Waveland with his father.Bryan Family Online Eventually, Joseph Bryan, Sr. moved out, leaving Joseph Henry Bryan as the owner of Waveland. While he owned Waveland, he established it as one of the premier thoroughbred and trotter farms in Kentucky. Waveland produced some great horses such as \\"Waveland Chief\\", \\"Ben-Hur\\", \\"Eric\\", \\"Olaf\\" and \\"Wild Rake\\", who never lost a heat and was sold to William Rockefeller for $7800 in the 1880s. Joseph Henry Bryan also built a race track across from the mansion. He and other businessmen would go out to watch horse races. The women, who were not allowed to go, would often go up to the top floor of the house and watch the races with their binoculars. Joseph Henry Bryan was a notorious gambler. In less than seven years, he lost over one million dollars. Another family member had to sell their home so that they could try to keep Joseph Henry Bryan from losing the property. Eventually, however, Bryan was unable to pay his debt. For this, he was never forgiven by his family. He had to sell the house at auction just to try to pay off the debt. Salle A. Scott bought Waveland in 1894. She sold the property in 1899 to James A Hullet. In 1956, the Commonwealth of Kentucky bought the house and less than of the original for use by the University of Kentucky as experimental farmland. Museum In 1957, Waveland became a museum that depicted Kentucky life from pioneer days to the Civil War. The house sits on 10 acres of land and now depicts life on a plantation during the 1840s. Period-appropriate furniture was donated to the site. Many of the buildings did not survive, but Waveland currently contains the mansion, decorated in Antebellum style, and four outbuildings, which are the ice house, a two-story brick building that was the slave quarters, a barn, and a smokehouse. Tours are given daily for much of the year, and the tour guides dress in the style of the 1840s. Tours include the historic house, the slave quarters, smokehouse and ice house, and focus on the Bryan family and life on a 19th-century Kentucky plantation.

Resonance ionization spectroscopy The ionization threshold energy of atoms and small molecules are typically larger than the photon energies that are most easily available experimentally. However, it can be possible to span this ionization threshold energy if the photon energy is resonant with an intermediate electronically excited state. While it is often possible to observe the lower Rydberg levels in conventional spectroscopy of atoms and small molecules, Rydberg states are even more important in laser ionization experiments. Laser spectroscopic experiments often involve ionization through a photon energy resonance at an intermediate level, with an unbound final electron state and an ionic core. On resonance for phototransitions permitted by selection rules, the intensity of the laser in combination with the excited state lifetime makes ionization an expected outcome. This RIS approach and variations permit sensitive detection of specific species. Low Rydberg levels and resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization High photon intensity experiments can involve multiphoton processes with the absorption of integer multiples of the photon energy. In experiments that involve a multiphoton resonance, the intermediate is often a Rydberg state, and the final state is often an ion. The initial state of the system, photon energy, angular momentum and other selection rules can help in determining the nature of the intermediate state. This approach is exploited in resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy (REMPI). An advantage of this spectroscopic technique is that the ions can be detected with almost complete efficiency and even resolved for their mass. It is also possible to gain additional information by performing experiments to look at the energy of the liberated photoelectron in these experiments. (Compton and Johnson pioneered the development of REMPI) Near-threshold Rydberg levels The same approach that produces an ionization event can be used to access the dense manifold of near-threshold Rydberg states with laser experiments. These experiments often involve a laser operating at one wavelength to access the intermediate Rydberg state and a second wavelength laser to access the near-threshold Rydberg state region. Because of the photoabsorption selection rules, these Rydberg electrons are expected to be in highly elliptical angular momentum states. It is the Rydberg electrons excited to nearly circular angular momentum states that are expected to have the longest lifetimes. The conversion between a highly elliptical and a nearly circular near-threshold Rydberg state might happen in several ways, including encountering small stray electric fields. Zero electron kinetic energy spectroscopy Zero electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy was developed with the idea of collecting only the resonance ionization photoelectrons that have extremely low kinetic energy. The technique involves waiting for a period of time after a resonance ionization experiment and then pulsing an electric field to collect the lowest energy photoelectrons in a detector. Typically, ZEKE experiments utilize two different tunable lasers. One laser photon energy is tuned to be resonant with the energy of an intermediate state. (This may be resonant with an excited state at a multiphoton transition.) Another photon energy is tuned to be close to the ionization threshold energy. The technique worked extremely well and demonstrated energy resolution that was significantly better than the laser bandwidth. It turns out that it was not the photoelectrons that were detected in ZEKE. The delay between the laser and the electric field pulse selected the longest lived and most circular Rydberg states closest to the energy of the ion core. The population distribution of surviving long-lived near threshold Rydberg states is close to the laser energy bandwidth. The electric field pulse stark shifts the near-threshold Rydberg states and vibrational autoionization occurs. ZEKE has provided a significant advance in the study of the vibrational spectroscopy of molecular ions. Schlag, Peatman and M√ºller- Dethlefs originated ZEKE spectroscopy. Mass analyzed threshold ionization Mass analyzed threshold ionization (MATI) was developed with idea of collecting the mass of the ions in a ZEKE experiment. MATI offered a mass resolution advantage to ZEKE. Because MATI also exploits vibrational autoionization of near-threshold Rydberg states, it also can offer a comparable resolution with the laser bandwidth. This information can be indispensable in understanding a variety of systems. Photo-induced Rydberg ionization Photo-induced Rydberg ionization (PIRI) was developed following REMPI experiments on electronic autoionization of low-lying Rydberg states of carbon dioxide. In REMPI photoelectron experiments, it was determined that a two-photon ionic core photoabsorption process (followed by prompt electronic autoionization) could dominate the direct single photon absorption in the ionization of some Rydberg states of carbon dioxide. These sorts of two excited electron systems had already been under study in the atomic physics, but there the experiments involved high order Rydberg states. PIRI works because electronic autoionization can dominate direct photoionization (photoionization). The circularized near-threshold Rydberg state is more likely to undergo a core photoabsorption than to absorb a photon and directly ionize the Rydberg state. PIRI extends the near-threshold spectroscopic techniques to allow access to the electronic states (including dissociative molecular states and other hard to study systems) as well as the vibrational states of molecular ions.

Administratively it acts as a municipal borough divided into 12 subordinate parishes based on the town and its surrounding villages: Becklingen, Belsen, Bergen, Bleckmar, Diesten, Dohnsen, Eversen, Hagen, Hassel, Offen, S√ºlze and Wardb√∂hmen. Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was located in the area of Belsen. The town had 13,099 inhabitants according to the census conducted in December 2008.Landesbetrieb f√ºr Statistik und Kommunikationstechnologie Niedersachsen - Bev√∂lkerungsfortschreibung. (Lower Saxon Department of Statistics and Communication Technology - Population as at 31 Dec 2008.) Members of the British military and their families, who were not included in the census, brought the actual population to about 17,000. These soldiers occupied a NATO base and exercise on the Bergen-Hohne Training Area just outside the town, but the base closed in summer 2015 as part of the British Army's withdrawal from Germany. The Sieben Steinh√§user, a cluster of dolmens dating from the Stone Age, are located within the training area. Geography Bergen is located in the north of Celle district on the L√ºneburg Heath, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The Bundesstra√üe 3 (B3) passed through the municipal territory from north to south. Neighbouring communities Bergen is bordered by (from the north, clockwise): Wietzendorf (located in Heidekreis district), S√ºdheide, Eschede, Celle, Winsen an der Aller and the unincorporated area Lohheide (all in Celle district).  History  Bergen was first mentioned in the records in 1197 and was the centre of a legislative and administrative region, the seat of the district sheriff (Amtsvogtei) and, later, the Royal Hanoverian Office. After the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover by Prussia in 1866 the Amt Bergen, formed in 1852, was incorporated into Fallingbostel district, which had been created in 1867. In the district reorganisation of 1885, the Amt was transferred into the newly formed Celle district. If the development of Bergen was rather slow during the Middle Ages and the early part of the Modern Age, due mainly to fires in 1354, 1585 and 1796, the agricultural reform in the 19th century and the town's connection to the Celle‚ÄìSoltau railway led to far-reaching changes. In particular, the creation of the military training area that is today the Bergen-Hohne Training Area in 1935 encouraged the beginning of a period of urbanisation that has led to Bergen's transformation from an agriculturally based village into the small town it is today, characterised by trade and commerce with agriculture having largely lost its significance. The Bergen-Belsen concentration camp is located near Bergen. 1836 \\"no entry\\" road sign by order of the \\"Royal Great British and Hanoverian District Office\\" Today the town of Bergen acts as a municipality in the northern part of Celle district and is, except for Celle, the only political entity in the district that has been granted the status of a town (in this case in 1957). In the Gebietsreform (municipal reorganization) of 1971, Bergen was given responsibility for the Stadtteile of Becklingen, Belsen, Bleckmar, Diesten, Dohnsen, Eversen, Hagen, Hassel, Nindorf, Offen, S√ºlze and Wardb√∂hmen. That significantly increased the size of its population and its area. The area of the original town of Bergen was ; after the administrative reform it grew to 163 km¬≤. Demographics Today around 14,000 people live in the town of Bergen. About 3,000 members of the British Forces and their families departed in summer 2015 when the British left Bergen-Hohne Garrison. Arts and culture Due to the presence of foreign troops in the area, including Dutch and British both military and their families have come to Bergen. This has influenced the cultural environment of the town strongly; for example a typical Dutch carnival is held annually which is very uncharacteristic of this area. The Bergen-Hohne British base held a bonfire night on 5 November which was free to all local residents to attend forming strong ties with the community. Attractions= R√∂mstedthaus local history museum  R√∂mstedthaus local history museum The R√∂mstedthaus is a farmhouse museum dedicated to local and regional history. Its focus is the life and work of farmer up to the turn of the century in 1900. It is located in a former smokehouse (Rauchhaus), about 350 years old, that is still on the spot it was built. The old farmstead and church cottage (Pfarrkote) was first mentioned in 1438. \\"Wobbeke Scroders\\" was the farmer at that time. In 1831 the cottage and the land were rented, and the house continued to be used until 1912 as a smokehouse. The Bergen Local History Society bought the house in 1912. The preceptor, Friedrich R√∂mstedt (1849‚Äì1930), furnished the house with a collection of prehistoric and local historic artefacts. In 1913 the museum was opened. In the middle of the military training area to the west of Bergen are the well known Sieben Steinh√§user, a group of five megalithic graves from the late Funnelbeaker culture (3500-2800 B.C.), which are today a cultural monument. Memorials In the centre of town, on the Friedensplatz (\\"Peace Square\\") immediately next to St. Lambert's Church are three memorials: *A war memorial - to the fallen of the First (1914‚Äì1918) and Second World Wars (1939‚Äì1945). It was inaugurated on 30 April 1922. On the front is the inscription \\"Das Kirchspiel Bergen 1914‚Äì1918 seinen Helden\\" (\\"The parish of Bergen 1914‚Äì1918 [in honour of] its heroes\\") and on the rear: \\"Die Liebe h√∂ret nimmer auf\\" (\\"Love never ends\\"). *A sandstone monument - with a white marble plaque in memory of the fallen of the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1871). Inaugurated on 22 June 1878. The marble tablet bears the inscription \\"In Erinnerung an die in den Jahren 1870 u. 71 gefallenen Krieger aus dem Kirchspiel Bergen\\" (\\"In memory of those warriors from the parish of Bergen who fell in the years 1870 and 1871\\"). *A peace monument - that has a lively history. It was originally erected for the peace celebrations on the occasion of the ending of French rule. In the Battle of Leipzig (October 1813) the troops of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte were defeated and the First Treaty of Paris was signed (30 May 1814). By order of the prince-regent (Britain's George IV) all the churches of the land celebrated a peace festival on 24 July 1814. The square, hitherto, called Buernbrink and used for annual fairs, was given the name of Friedensplatz (\\"Peace Square\\"). A wooden post was erected which bore the inscription \\"Zur Friedensfeier! Bergen, den 24. Juli 1814\\" ‚Äì \\"Dem Vaterlande Heil\\" ‚Äì \\"Friede dem Jahrhunderte\\" (\\"The Peace Festival! Bergen, 24 July 1814\\" - \\"Salvation to the Fatherland\\" - \\"Peace to the centuries\\"). In the mid-19th century the post, which had meanwhile become rotten, fell over and was replaced in 1865 by another wooden monument for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. That monument also deteriorated and was replaced by the present sandstone one. This has the following inscription: Zur Friedensfeier ‚Äì Bergen, den 24. Juli ‚Äì 1814. Erneuert zur ‚Äì 50 j√§hrigen Jubelfeier ‚Äì der Schlacht bei ‚Äì Waterloo ‚Äì am 18. Juni 1865 ‚Äì und errichtet in Stein ‚Äì 1898 (\\"To the peace celebrations in Bergen on 24 July 1814. Restored for the 50th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1865 and erected in stone in 1898\\") On the back of the monument is the crowned cursive monogram \\"GR\\" (Georgius Rex) of George V King of Hanover. On the sides are the words: Dem Vaterlande Heil (\\"Salvation to the Fatherland\\") and Friede dem Jahrhunderte (\\"Peace to the centuries\\").

In addition the town of Bergen has friendly relations with the following: leftRo≈ænov pod Radho≈°tƒõm in the Czech Republic leftOttendorf-Okrilla in the county of Bautzen in Saxony leftPembroke (Malta) in Malta  Infrastructure= District court  The Gogericht by Ferdinand Br√ºtt which hangs in the present council chamber of the municipal hall From the 15th century the parishes of Bergen and Wietzendorf were part of a united juridical district or Gogericht. From 1437 to 1852, the courts were presided over by judges known as Gografen. They were subordinated to the advocacy or Vogtei of Celle, which later became a Great Advocacy (Gro√üvogtei). The first Gograf was Ludermann Tunderen (1437‚Äì1445). From 1674 the new L√ºneburg district constitution set out the range of responsibilities of the district advocacies (Amtsvogteien). Until the end of the Thirty Years' War the private residence of the district advocates (Amtsv√∂gte) also served as their seat (Amtssitz). In 1651 the old house of Kocksche Kote, Bergen No. 5, which paid dues to the Abbey of St. Michael's in L√ºneburg, became the official seat of the district judge. In 1653 the government bought the farmstead from the heirs of the district judge, Cord Brase, and upgraded it into a district advocacy building (Amtsvogteigeb√§ude). In 1709 the building, was completely rebuilt under district advocate, Jost Hinrich Wolff (Bergen's primary school is named after him). In 1852 there was a separation of the judiciary from the administration within the Kingdom of Hanover. From then on, Prussian law appliedVerfassung Preu√üens vom 31. Januar 1850 and there was both a district office (Amt Bergen) and a district court (Amtsgericht Bergen). In the wake of these reforms, the Vogtei of Wietzendorf was split away from Bergen. The first district judge (Amtsrichter) was Ernst August Eggert von Estorff. On the land of the district court, which amounts to 6,480 m¬≤, there is an office building, a residential building, a district prison and several outbuildings. In 1945 there was a reform of the German courts. The district court in Bergen became a branch of the district court of Celle. On 1 July 1973 the Bergen District Court was closed.  Municipal hall (Stadthaus)  The Stadthaus (former district court) In 1975 the town of Bergen sold the land of the old district court. Initially it was used as a youth centre, but there were plans for a leisure centre or town library. Even a police school was considered. In 1979 it was decided to sell the old town hall and move the council offices here. Because the negotiations over the sale dragged on and a large number of the townsfolk were against the proposal, it was eventually dropped. On 20 October 1981 it was decided to build a new municipal building with a banquet hall. The old district office of 1653/1709 and the district prison from 1853 were to be largely preserved as listed buildings and integrated. In an architectural competition, Hans-Joachim Ehrich from Brunswick won first prize for his design. In 1984 the rebuilding work began. On 6 December 1985 the new municipal hall or Stadthaus was inaugurated. It had cost over seven million DM. It has a banqueting hall for up to 530 people with a stage and side rooms, event rooms, a council chamber with a gallery, and various conference rooms. In the council chamber of the Stadthaus hangs the painting Gogericht by Bergen artist, Ferdinand Br√ºtt (1849‚àí1936). It was a precursor to a painting in the L√ºneburg State Court (Landgericht L√ºneburg)].  Military training area  Between Bergen, Mei√üendorf and Fallingbostel, roughly in the area between the A 7 and the B 3, is the military training area of Bergen-Hohne. To create this training area, several villages, including Hartem, were evacuated in 1938 by the German Wehrmacht, along with individual homesteads. Some of their ruins can still be seen. Within a few years about 3,650 inhabitants from 25 parishes had to leave their homes. On the eastern perimeter of the terrain, near the village of Belsen, at that time called Ostlager, around 100 barrack blocks, 50 horse stables and 40 large vehicle garages were built, along with a medical centre, depots and a target factory. The largest village in this area was and is Ostenholz, which was not cleared and is like an island of habitation within the training area. Today, the area is used by the Bundeswehr and other NATO forces. The civil administration of the training area is carried out by the two unincorporated areas of LohheideGemeindefreier Bezirk Lohheide in the east and Osterheide in the west.  Churches and religious organisations  * Lutheran parish of St. Lambert's * Gemeinde Gottes Bergen * Roman-Catholic parish of Zum kostbaren Blute * Independent Lutheran parish of St. John in Bergen-Bleckmar * Missionary work: Bleckmar branch of the Lutheran Church Mission (Lutherische Kirchenmission ‚àí Bleckmarer Mission e. V.) since 1892.  Transport  Bergen lies on the B 3 federal highway from Celle via Soltau to Ovelg√∂nne near Buxtehude. Several state roads (Landesstra√üen) serve the surrounding area which is mainly agricultural and lead, inter alia, to Hermannsburg and Winsen (Aller). The nearest motorway junction is Soltau-S√ºd on the A7 autobahn from Hamburg to Hanover. In addition, the Celle‚ÄìSoltau railway runs through the town. This no longer provides a passenger service, but is very important for the transportation of goods.

The group was formed in 2003 and was composed of Gisele Abramoff as the vocalist, and Tibor Yuzo and Tom Hopkins as the producers. Everything started when Gisele recorded a new version for Livin' On A Prayer, originally by Bon Jovi, with no strings attached, just for fun. They didn't expect the remix to be so successful in Brazilian dance clubs and playlists. After that, Angel and Dreams (written by Gisele) were recorded and Dalimas became one of the most famous dance groups in Brazil. On 2004, Gisele performed Livin' On A Prayer and Dreams at the 2004 Planet Pop Festival, a two-day dance music festival in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in front of more than 7.000 people. In the same night, Lasgo and Ian Van Dahl also performed. On 2005, they were back in the second edition of the Festival, performing in the same night as Jan Wayne, Cuva and Magic Box. When 2006 arrived, Dalimas had a massive and loyal fanbase, including an official fanclub and a 6.000 members community in Orkut. Gisele performed songs from her debut album \\"Dreams\\" on the 2006 Planet Pop Festival, in front of an estimated 10.000 people and on the same night as Belgian dance acts Lasgo and Ian Van Dahl. \\"Dreams\\" The group released their first CD in December 2005, entitled \\"Dreams\\".

It is located in the southeast corner of Catholic University‚Äôs main campus, near the Brookland‚ÄìCUA station. It has been described as \\"Harvard on the outside, Google on the inside\\" and \\"one of the premier academic buildings in Washington, D.C. if not the country.\\" History The Martin Maloney Chemical Laboratory was dedicated on November 15, 1917 and named for Martin Maloney, a Philadelphia philanthropist and papal marquis. Maloney gave $120,000 in 1917 to construct the main building and $100,000 in 1923-24 for what is today the 273 seat Della Ratta Auditorium. The philanthropist said he hoped the building would \\"help our Catholic young men and women rise to the level of the great opportunities, which our nation offers them. James A. Farrell, president of the United States Steel Corporation, was a featured speaker at the dedication The fieldstone Gothic‚Äêstyle building was designed by architect Frederick Vernon Murphy who studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts. Upon his return to D.C. from Paris, Murphy introduced himself to the fourth rector of Catholic University, Rev. Thomas Joseph Shahan. The two men, who became great friends, planned the early campus, including Maloney, Father O‚ÄôConnell, and Gibbons Halls, the John K. Mullen of Denver Memorial Library, and the old gymnasium. As the lab was opened in Washington D.C. in the midst of World War I, the United States Army took over the lab to conduct chemical research. It was here that the chemical weapon lewisite was first invented by Julius Nieuwland and Winford Lee Lewis, with the help of CUA and Army researchers. Maloney Hall underwent renovations and extensions in 1926. Busch School=Renovation In 2016, a $47 million renovation was announced, with a lead gift of $15 million coming from Tim Busch. The renovation turned the building into a \\"Gothic-chic\\" home for the Busch School of Business which opened in January 2019. Prior to the renovation, the Busch School took up 25% of McMahon Hall, and the School was scattered throughout six buildings on campus with students taking classes in 10. The principal architect was Brian Pilot, a Catholic University alumnus, along with his firm, Studios Architecture. Construction was carried out by Whiting-Turner Construction, and included Chris Saxon, Rachel Hutton, and Nick Carneglia, all of whom are University alumni. It was rededicated in March 2019. The 61,000 square foot building maintains the original Collegiate Gothic features, but modern updates including tiered case study classrooms modeled after those at Harvard Business School and top business schools around the world. The nine \\"smart\\" classrooms are tiered to promote class discussions. The building also features nearly 40 offices, conference rooms, touchdown rooms, and glass-walled study pods for students to use on projects that require teamwork and communication. Saint Michael the Archangel Chapel The 2019 construction also added a chapel dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel designed by Studio Granda Architects, a Spanish firm. The chapel's original artwork was commissioned by artists in Spain. The stained glass windows feature saints and holy people chosen to serve as inspirations for business students, including Catherine of Alexandria, Enrique Ernesto Shaw, Pier Giorgio Frassati, Margaret Clitherow, Pope Gregory I, Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, Elizabeth Ann Seton, Thomas Aquinas, Katherine Drexel, and Maximilian Kolbe. The altar panel shows Christ in Heaven surrounded by four figures emblematic of the four pillars of Catholic Social Teaching: Saint Matthew the Evangelist representing the common good, Pope John Paul II representing solidarity, Theresa of Calcutta representing human dignity, and Louis Martin and Marie-Az√©lie Gu√©rin representing subsidiarity. The panel also depicts Pope Leo XIII, the pope who approved the founding of the university. The tabernacle, which is made of marble and gold, is a scale model of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception which is nearby on the southwest corner of the campus. The first mass in the chapel was celebrated by Fr. Louis Maxmillian, O.F.M. Conv., on February 18, 2019. The chapel is the spiritual heart of the building, and the Busch School.

After his initial training with Shri Sudhir Roy, he began a long discipleship with Pandit Shymal Bose. Sandip's performances are marked with spontaneous innovation and tonal purity even when he is delivering complex rhythmic patterns at high speed. His initial trip to the USA was sponsored by the founder of Transcendental Meditation and Beatles guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Sandip Burman either performs for shows across the world or attends school- sponsored performances. In these lessons he is known to take the same care of warming up and playing as if it were a real performance. He tunes his 20 string sitar and tabla for around an hour prior to his lesson. Once all the students surround him he begins to play - a wide display of improvisation that seems to come from his soul. After he performs on sitar he leaves a portion of the clinic open for questions to get to know him and learn from him. Then he moves to his expertise, the tabla. His hands fly through the drums at lightning speed and precision filling the area with a melody rather than a beat. Sandip has played with Ravi Shankar and countless jazz greats, including Jack DeJohnette, Al Di Meola, Randy Brecker, Howard Levy, Paul McCandless, Andy Narell, Victor Wooten, Bela Fleck and many others. Sandip worked with Danny Elfman and contributed to the soundtrack of Tim Burton's film, Mars Attacks!, and an IBM commercial. Sandip has recorded with Dr. L. Subramaniam and is showcased on the album Global Fusion from Warner Brothers. In 2001, Sandip lead an all-star tour titled \\"East Meets Jazz\\" with Victor Bailey (Weather Report), Randy Brecker (Brecker Brothers), Steve Smith (Journey), Howard Levy (Flecktones), Jerry Goodman (Mahavishnu Orchestra), and Paul Bollenback. Dave Pietro also joined the group for one show. The tour ended suddenly and early due to the 9/11 attack but closed at The Lyric with a standing room only show the night of 9/11 that is still talked about years later. The band's Producer & Manager (Chuck Hawks) was noted as saying despite the stresses of the day, it turned out to be one of the band's best performances of the entire tour. Currently, Sandip tours 170 days out of the year, with such dates as solo performances at the Kennedy Center (Washington D.C.), Street Scene (San Diego), First Night Providence (Rhode Island), House of Blues Chicago, Nelson Atkins Museum (Kansas City), Wolftrap (Washington, D.C.), Ravinia Festival (Chicago), Skirball Cultural Center (Los Angeles), Telluride Bluegrass Festival (Colorado), and the Stern Grove Festival (San Francisco). Before concerts, Sandip often takes the time to conduct music clinics at the local high schools and universities. He has been a visiting faculty member at the Rotterdam Conservatory in the Netherlands and has toured and taught in the United States, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore, North Africa, Israel, and Canada.Sandip Burman Official Site ReferencesExternal links *Sandip Burman Official Site Category:Tripuri people Category:American people of Bengali descent Category:American male musicians of Indian descent Category:American musicians of Indian descent Category:American Hindus Category:Living people Category:Indian emigrants to the United States Category:Indian drummers Category:People from Durgapur, West Bengal Category:1969 births ","title":"Sandip Burman"},{"id":"4119490","text":"This glossary of education-related terms is based on how they commonly are used in Wikipedia articles. This page contains terms starting with A ‚Äì C. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. 0-9 ;.edu ;\\"dot-edu\\" : The generic top-level domain for educational institutions, primarily those in the United States. Created in January 1985 as one of the first top-level domains, .edu was originally intended for educational institutions anywhere in the world. With few exceptions, however, only those in the United States registered such domains, while educational institutions in other countries usually used domain names under the appropriate country code TLD. A Plato, seen with Aristotle, is credited with the inception of academia. ;Academia: A collective term for the scientific and cultural community engaged in higher education and research, taken as a whole. The word comes from the akademeia just outside ancient Athens, where the gymnasium was made famous by Plato as a center of learning. ;Academic degree: A degree is any of a wide range of status levels conferred by institutions of higher education, such as universities, normally as the result of successfully completing a program of study. ;Academic dress : Traditional clothing worn specifically in academic settings. It is more commonly seen nowadays only at graduation ceremonies, but in former times academic dress was, and to a lesser extent in many ancient universities still is, worn on a daily basis. ;Academic institution: An educational institution dedicated to higher education and research, which grants academic degrees. ;Academic publishing: Describes a system of publishing that is necessary in order for academic scholars to review work and make it available for a wider audience. The \\"system,\\" which is probably disorganized enough not to merit the title, varies widely by field, and is also always changing, if often slowly. Most academic work is published in journal article or book form. ;Active learning: A process whereby learners are actively engaged in the learning process, rather than \\"passively\\" absorbing lectures. Active learning involves reading, writing, discussion, and engagement in solving problems, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Active learning often involves cooperative learning. ;Activity theory (AT): A Soviet psychological meta-theory, paradigm, or framework, with its roots in socio-cultural approach. Its founders were Alexei Nikolaevich Leontyev, and S. L. Rubinshtein (1889‚Äì1960). It became one of the major psychological approaches in the former USSR, being widely used in both theoretical and applied psychology, in areas such as the education, training, ergonomics, and work psychology. ;Additional Support Needs: In Scotland, children who require some additional support to remove barriers to learning in any respect are deemed to have Additional Support Needs. This definition abolished the previously used term Special Educational Needs and was set out in the 2004 Additional Support for Learning Act. ;Adult education: The practice of teaching and educating adults. This is often done in the workplace, or through 'extension' or 'continuing education' courses at secondary schools, or at a College or University. The practice is also often referred to as 'Training and Development'. It has also been referred to as andragogy (to distinguish it from pedagogy). :Educating adults differs from educating children in several ways. One of the most important differences is that adults have accumulated knowledge and experience which can either add value to a learning experience or hinder it. ;Adultism: A predisposition towards adults, which some see as biased against children, youth, and all young people who aren't addressed or viewed as adults. Adultism is popularly used to describe any discrimination against young people, and is distinguished from ageism, which is simply prejudice on the grounds of age; not specifically against youth. ;Advanced Placement Program : A United States and Canada-based program that offers high school students the opportunity to receive university credit for their work during high school. ;Agricultural education: Instruction about crop production, livestock management, soil and water conservation, and various other aspects of agriculture. Agricultural education includes instruction in food education, such as nutrition. Agricultural and food education improves the quality of life for all people by helping farmers increase production, conserve resources, and provide nutritious foods. ;Aims and objectives: An aim expresses the purpose of the educational unit or course whereas an objective is a statement of a goal which successful participants are expected demonstrably to achieve before the course or unit completes. ;Alternative education : Describes a number of approaches to teaching and learning other than traditional publicly- or privately-run schools. These approaches can be applied to all students of all ages, from infancy to adulthood, and all levels of education. ;Analysis: The action of taking something apart in order to study it. ;Andragogy: A theory of adult education proposed by the American educator Malcolm Knowles (April 24, 1913‚ÄîNovember 27, 1997). :Knowles held that andragogy (from the Greek words meaning \\"man- leading\\") should be distinguished from the more commonly taught pedagogy (Greek: \\"child-leading\\"). ;Anti-bias curriculum: An active/activist approach in education that challenges interlocking systems of oppression such as racism, sexism, ableism/disablism, ageism, homophobia, and all the other -isms. :The objective of this approach to teaching is to eliminate bias found in various institutions. This approach attempts to provide children with a solid understanding of social problems and issues while equipping them with strategies to combat bias and improve social conditions for all. :The anti- bias curriculum serves as a catalyst in the critical analysis of various social conditions. It is implemented as a proactive means to eradicate various forms of social oppression with the ultimate goal of social justice in mind. ;Applied academics: An approach to learning and teaching that focuses on how academic subjects (communications, mathematics, science, and basic literacy) can apply to the real world. Further, applied academics can be viewed as theoretical knowledge supporting practical applications. ;Apprenticeship: A traditional method, still popular in some countries, of training a new generation of skilled crafts practitioners. Apprentices (or in early modern usage \\"prentices\\") built their careers from apprenticeships. ;Art education: The area of learning that is based upon the visual arts‚Äîdrawing, painting, sculpture, and design in such fine crafts of jewelry, pottery, weaving, fabrics, etc., and design applied to more practical fields such as commercial graphics and home furnishings. :The term \\"arts education\\" implies many things, but it is defined as: Instruction and programming in all arts disciplines‚Äîincluding but not limited to dance, music, visual art, theater, creative writing, media arts, history, criticism, and aesthetics. \\"Arts education\\" encompasses all the visual and performing arts delivered in a standards-based, sequential approach by a qualified instructor as part of the core curriculum. The most common courses provided in schools include Art (visual art), Band, Drama, and Choir. ;Assessment: The process of documenting, usually in measurable terms, knowledge, skills, attitudes and beliefs. ;Asynchronous learning: A teaching method using the asynchronous delivery of training materials or content using computer network technology. It is an approach to providing technology-based training that incorporates learner- centric models of instruction. The asynchronous format has been in existence for quite some time; however, new research and strategies suggest that this approach can enable learners to increase knowledge and skills through self- paced and self-directed modules completed when the learner is prepared and motivated to learn. ;Autodidacticism ;autodidactism: Self-education or self- directed learning. An autodidact, also known as an automath, is a mostly self- taught person - typically someone who has an enthusiasm for self-education and a high degree of self-motivation. B ;Behaviorism : An approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be researched scientifically without recourse to inner mental states. It is a form of materialism, denying any independent significance for the mind. :One of the assumptions of many behaviorists is that free will is illusory, and that all behaviour is determined by a combination of forces both genetic factors and the environment, either through association or reinforcement. ;Belief: A conviction to the truth of a proposition. Beliefs can be acquired through perception, contemplation or communication. In the psychological sense, belief is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude. :Knowledge is often defined as justified true belief, in that the belief must be considered to correspond to reality and must be derived from valid evidence and arguments. However, this definition has been challenged by the Gettier problem which suggests that justified true belief does not provide a complete picture of knowledge. ;Bias in education: A real or perceived bias in the educational system. ;Bilingual education: Has multiple definitions: :* education where two distinct languages are used for general teaching; :* education designed to help children become bilingual (sometimes called \\"two- way bilingual education\\"; e.g., Spanish speakers and English speakers in a classroom are all taught to speak both languages; :* education in a child's native language for (a) the first year or (b) however long it takes; followed by mainstreaming in English-only classes (in the US); :* education in a child's native language for as long as the child's parents wish (with minimal instruction in another language). :In the latter cases \\"native-language instruction\\" may be a clearer definition. ;Biliteracy: The state of being literate in two or more languages. To be biliterate has a stronger and more specified connotation than the claim of being simply bilingual. This is because with the change of the term from 'lingual' to 'literate' and the concept of reading and writing, which are in addition to simply speaking. In bilingualism the extent of fluency in each language is in question. One can be anywhere on the spectrum from comfortable oral communication in certain social contexts to fluency in speaking, reading and writing. With the term biliteracy, however, it is understood that fluency in both reading and writing are present. ;Blended learning: Learning in a combination of modes. Often used more specifically to refer to courses which use a combination of traditional face-to-face teaching and distance learning techniques on-line. ;Blogish: Interactive and personal communication as opposed to traditional narrative text. ;Boarding school: A school where some or all students not only study but also live, amongst their peers but away from their home and family. The word 'boarding' is used in the sense of a 'boarding house', lodgings which provide both bed and board, that is meals as well as a room. Most famous UK public schools are boarding schools for ages 13 to 18, either single-sex or coeducational. :There are any number of different types of boarding schools, for pupils of all school ages from boarding nursery or Kindergarten schools, to senior schools. Boarding prep schools for the age group 9 to 12 are becoming less usual in the UK, but many adolescents like to get away from home. ;Brainstorming: An organized approach for producing ideas by letting the mind think without interruption. The term was coined by Alex Osborn. Brainstorming can be done either individually or in a group; in group brainstorming sessions, the participants are encouraged, and often expected, to share their ideas with one another as soon as they are generated. The key to brainstorming is not to interrupt the thought process. As ideas come to the mind, they are captured and stimulate the development of better ideas. Brainstorming is used for enhancing creativity in order to generate a broad selection of ideas in leading to a unique and improved concept. ;Brainwashing ;thought reform: The application of coercive techniques to change the beliefs or behavior of one or more people for political purposes. Whether any techniques at all exist that will actually work to change thought and behavior to the degree that the term \\"brainwashing\\" connotes is a controversial and at times hotly debated question. ;Bridge program: This is a higher education program specifically designed to assist a student with an attained initial educational level (or an initial level of professional licensure) to attend college courses and achieve a terminal degree (or a higher level of professional licensure) in the same field of study and in less time than an entry-level student would require. Bridge programs are most notable among healthcare professions. ;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka: 347 U.S. 483 (1954) A landmark case of the United States Supreme Court which explicitly outlawed de jure racial segregation of public education facilities (legal establishment of separate government-run schools for blacks and whites), ruling so on the grounds that the doctrine of \\"separate but equal\\" public education could never truly provide black Americans with facilities of the same standards available to white Americans. A companion case dealt with the constitutionality of segregation in the District of Columbia, (not a state and therefore not subject to the Fourteenth Amendment), Bolling v. Sharpe, . ;Bully: An individual, thought to be emotionally dysfunctional, who torments others through verbal harassment, physical assault, or other more subtle methods of coercion. C ;Campus novel: A novel whose main action is set in and around the campus of a university. The genre, dating back to the late 1940s, is popular because it allows the author to show the quirks of human nature, and reactions to pressure (for exams etc.) within a controlled environment or to describe the reaction of a fixed socio-cultural perspective (the academic staff) to new social attitudes (the new student intake). ;Chemistry education: An active area of research within both the disciplines of chemistry and education. The main focus of research is on learning and teaching of chemistry in schools, colleges and universities. The practice of chemical education is teaching chemistry to students and the training of teachers to teach chemistry. The research aspect deals with how to teach and how to improve learning outcomes. ;Child : A young human. Depending on context it may mean someone who is not yet an adult, or someone who has not yet reached puberty (someone who is prepubescent). Child is also a counterpart of parent: adults are the children of their parents despite their maturation beyond infancy; for example \\"Benjamin, aged 46, is the child of Tobias, aged 73\\". ;Classical conditioning ;Pavlovian conditioning ;respondent conditioning: A type of associative learning. These associations are formed by pairing two stimuli‚Äîwhat Ivan Pavlov described as the learning of conditioned behavior‚Äîto condition an animal to give a certain response. The simplest form of classical conditioning is reminiscent of what Aristotle would have called the law of contiguity which states that: \\"When two things commonly occur together, the appearance of one will bring the other to mind.\\" ;Classical education: May refer to the education of antiquity and the Middle Ages, or the education of later periods based on Classics and Western culture, or the completely different Chinese tradition of education, based in large part on Confucian and Taoist traditions. ;Classroom management: A term used by many teachers to describe the process of ensuring lessons run smoothly without disruptive behaviour by students. It is possibly the most difficult aspect of teaching for many teachers and indeed experiencing problems in this area causes many people to leave teaching altogether. It is closely linked to issues of motivation, discipline and respect. ;Coaching: A coach is a person who teaches and directs another person via encouragement and advice. This use of the term \\"coaching\\" appears to have origins in English traditional university \\"cramming\\" in the mid-19th century. (The name allegedly recalls the multitasking skills associated with controlling the team of a horse-drawn stagecoach.) By the 1880s American college sports teams had‚Äîin addition to managers -- coaches. Some time in the 20th century, non-sporting coaches emerged: non-experts in the specific technical skills of their clients, but who nevertheless ventured to offer generalised motivational or inspirational advice. ;Coeducation: The integrated education of men and women at the same school facilities; co-ed is a shortened adjectival form of co-educational. Before the 1960s, many private institutions of higher education restricted their enrollment to a single sex. Indeed, most institutions of higher education‚Äîregardless of being public or private‚Äîrestricted their enrollment to a single sex at some point in their history. \\"Coed\\" is an informal (and increasingly archaic) term for a female student attending such a college or university. ;Cognitive maps : A type of mental processing, or cognition, composed of a series of psychological transformations by which an individual can acquire, code, store, recall, and decode information about the relative locations and attributes of phenomena in their everyday or metaphorical spatial environment. Here, 'cognition' can be used to refer to the mental models, or belief systems, that people use to perceive, contextualize, simplify, and make sense of otherwise complex problems. As they have been studied in various fields of science, these mental models are often referred to, variously, as cognitive maps, scripts, schemata, and frames of reference. ;Cognitive relativism: A philosophy that claims the truth or falsity of a statement is relative to a social group. ;Collaborative learning: An umbrella term for a variety of approaches in education that involve joint intellectual effort by students or students and teachers. Groups of students work together in searching for understanding, meaning or solutions or in creating a product. The approach is closely related to cooperative learning, but is considered to be more radical because of its reliance on youth voice. Collaborative learning activities can include collaborative writing, group projects, and other activities. ;College: An educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, or a secondary school. ;College athletics: Refers to a set of physical activities comprising sports and games put into place by institutions of tertiary education (colleges in American English). In the United States, college athletics is overseen by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. College athletics has a high profile in the United States, and to a lesser extent in Canada, where it is known as interuniversity sport. In the most of the rest of the world the equivalent level of competition is only followed by the competitors and their close friends and families. ;Common sense : What people in common would agree; that which they \\"sense\\" in common as their common natural understanding. Some use the phrase to refer to beliefs or propositions that in their opinion they consider would in most people's experience be prudent and of sound judgment, without dependence upon esoteric knowledge or study or research, but based upon what is believed to be knowledge held by people \\"in common\\". The knowledge and experience most people have, or are believed to have by the person using the term. ;Community of practice : Refers to the process of social learning that occurs when people who have a common interest in some subject or problem collaborate over an extended period to share ideas, find solutions, and build innovations. ;Comparative education: Seeks to throw light on education in one country (or group of countries) by using data and insights drawn from the practises and situation in another country, or countries. ;Computer Based Learning : Refers to the use of computers as a key component of the educational environment. While this can refer to the use of computers in a classroom, the term more broadly refers to a structured environment in which computers are used for teaching purposes. The concept is generally seen as being distinct from the use of computers in ways where learning is at least a peripheral element of the experience (e.g. computer games and web browsing).A concept map ;Concept mapping: A technique for visualizing the relationships between different concepts. A concept map is a diagram showing the relationships between concepts. Concepts are connected with labelled arrows, in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts is articulated in linking phrases, e.g., \\"gives rise to\\", \\"results in\\", \\"is required by,\\" or \\"contributes to\\". Concept mapping serves several purposes. One, which takes place via knowledge elicitation, is to represent the mental models, i.e., the cognitive map of individuals, teams and organizations. Another, which takes place by knowledge capture, is to represent the structure of knowledge gleaned from written documents. The addition of knowledge resources, e.g., diagrams, reports, other concept maps, spreadsheets, etc., to the concept nodes (attached during or after construction) has been found to significantly improve the level of meaningful learning of the concept mapper. Educators are increasingly realising the utility of such maps and have started using them in classroom. ;Constructivism: A set of assumptions about the nature of human learning that guide constructivist learning theories and teaching methods. Constructivism values developmentally appropriate, teacher-supported learning that is initiated and directed by the student. ;Constructivist epistemology: A recent development in philosophy which criticizes essentialism, whether it is in the form of medieval realism, classical rationalism, or empiricism. It originated in sociology under the term social constructionism and has been given the name constructivism when referring to philosophical epistemology, though constructionism and constructivism are often used interchangeably. :Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \\"constructed,\\" because it does not reflect any external \\"transcendent\\" realities; it is contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender are socially constructed (Hegel, Garns, and Marx were among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of social determinism). The common thread between all forms of constructivism is that they do not focus on an ontological reality, but instead on the constructed reality. ;Cooperative education: A structured method of combining academic education with practical work experience. Research indicates that one of the attributes employers value most in newly hired employees is work experience. A cooperative education experience, commonly known as a \\"co-op\\", provides academic credit for career work. Cooperative education is taking on new importance in school-to-work transition, service learning, and experiential learning initiatives. ;Cooperative learning: Proposed in response to traditional curriculum-driven education. In cooperative learning environments, students interact in purposely structured heterogeneous group to support the learning of one self and others in the same group. ;Course: in the United States, a unit of instruction in one subject, lasting one academic term ;Course of study: in the British Commonwealth, a programme of education leading to a degree or diploma ;Creativity: A human mental phenomenon based around the deployment of mental skills and/or conceptual tools, which, in turn, originate and develop innovation, inspiration, or insight. ;Creativity techniques: Heuristic methods to facilitate creativity in a person or a group of people. Generally, most creativity techniques use associations between the goal (or the problem), the current state (which may be an imperfect solution to the problem), and some stimulus (possibly selected randomly). There is an analogy between many creativity techniques and methods of evolutionary computation. ;Critical pedagogy: A teaching approach which attempts to help students question and challenge domination, and the beliefs and practices that dominate. In other words, it is a theory and practice of helping students achieve critical consciousness. In this tradition the teacher works to lead students to question ideologies and practices considered oppressive (including those at school), and encourage liberatory collective and individual responses to the actual conditions of their own lives. ;Critical thinking: Consists of a mental process of analyzing or evaluating information, particularly statements or propositions that people have offered as true. It forms a process of reflecting upon the meaning of statements, examining the offered evidence and reasoning, and forming judgments about the facts. Critical thinkers can gather such information from observation, experience, reasoning, and/or communication. Critical thinking has its basis in intellectual values that go beyond subject-matter divisions and which include: clarity, accuracy, precision, evidence, thoroughness and fairness. ;Cultural learning: The way a group of people within a society or culture tend to learn and pass on new information. Learning styles are greatly influenced by how a culture socializes with its children and young people. ;Curriculum: (plural curricula) The set of courses and their contents offered by an institution such as a school or university. In some cases, a curriculum may be partially or entirely determined by an external body (such as the National Curriculum for England in English schools). In the U.S., the basic curriculum is established by each state with the individual school districts adjusting it to their desires; in Australia each state's Education Department sets the various curricula.

It was founded in 1984 by Steven Bengis and Penny Cuninggim to treat extremely challenged youth with learning disabilities, mental illness, and/or neurological disorders. NEARI operates Chapter 766 special education day schools for high school, middle school, and older elementary school students. Additionally, NEARI operates a training institute and a publishing company The publishing company has published works ranging from manuals for specialists in the field of sexual assault to survivor stories. All works are selected for publication based on their ability to educate the public.  Educational philosophy  The NEARI day schools practice a \\"relationship-based\\" model of learning. This model is a set of policies and principles that guide staff to form lasting relationships with their students. Most of the details of this model are proprietary and can not be disclosed here. One publicly acknowledged piece of this model is a low student-to-staff ratio. NEARI operates on a ratio of about 3:1 or 2:1, depending on the program in question. The drawback to this approach is the substantial financial load it places on the organization.  Brain-based treatment and education  Since the year 2000, NEARI has been incorporating \\"brain-based\\" technology into its educational and therapeutic services. Coordinated by Penny Cuninggim, this initiative combines specialized exercise with an awareness of learning styles and new practices for diagnosing and treating visual and auditory processing issues.  Facilities = Current facilities  The NEARI day schools currently operate out of two buildings leased from the Immaculate Conception parish, which used to operate a parochial school out of the buildings. The structures total about , but the antiquated floor plan results in a significant amount of wasted space. The buildings have a computer-to-student ratio of 1:2 or better in all classrooms, all of which are Apple iMacs or newer. The structures' electrical system is outdated, however, which results in frequent tripping of circuit breakers. The school buildings do not have commercial kitchen facilities, so student meals are delivered daily by the Holyoke School Department. The facilities also suffer from poor insulation and aging HVAC systems, causing higher energy costs.  Future facilities  NEARI is in the process of constructing a new, state-of-the-art school, clinic, and training facility on Old Easthampton Road, near Route 141 in northern Holyoke. This facility is being planned as an environmentally-safe, energy efficient green building. This new structure is supposed to correct the wasted-space issue as well as providing modern kitchen, HVAC, and vocational services. The project is working closely with regulators to avoid harming any endangered species native to the Holyoke Range, such as the Marbled Salamander. The total cost of this project is currently estimated at over six million dollars.

Family He was born at 39 Fontes Pereira de Melo Avenue the son of Jos√© Ant√≥nio Pereira de E√ßa O'Neill (Lisbon, c. 1890 ‚Äì ?), a bank worker, and wife Maria da Gl√≥ria Vahia de Barros de Castro (17 March 1905 ‚Äì aft. October 1989), and paternal grandson of writer, poet, conferencewoman and journalist Maria O'Neill. He had an older sister, Maria Am√©lia Vahia de Castro O'Neill de Bulh√µes, who became a Nun. Career He was a self-taught person and worked as a publicity professional. Surrealist and concretist poet and writer, and a publicist, who collaborated in many periodicals. In 1948, O'Neill was among the founders of the Lisbon Surrealist Movement, along with M√°rio Cesariny de Vasconcelos, Jos√©-Augusto Fran√ßa and others. His writings soon diverged from Surrealist to form an original style whose poetry reflects a love/hate relationship with his country. His salient characteristics ‚Äì a disrespect of conventions, both social and literary, an attitude of permanent revolt, playfulness with language, and the use of parody and black humor ‚Äì are used to form a body of incisive depictions of what is to be Portuguese and his relation with the country. Although most of his works have been lost or are missing or in private collections some of his work was displayed in 2002 at an exhibit on the Surrealist movement. O'Neill was in permanent conflict with Portugal. While other contemporaries wrote poems that protested against national life under Salazar, O'Neill's attack ran deeper. Poems such as Standing at Fearful Attention and Portugal suggested that the dictatorial regime was a symptom (the worst symptom) of graver ills ‚Äì lack of courage and smallness of vision ‚Äì woven into the nation's psyche. Other poems, such as Lament of the Man Who Misses Being Blind, seemed to hold religion and mysticism responsible for an obscurantism that made change difficult if not impossible. A publicist by profession, famed for inventing some of the most ingenious advertising slogans of his time, O'Neill was unusually adept at manipulating words and using them in an efficacious manner, but he refused to put that talent at the service of a lyrically lofty, feel-good sort of poetry (see 'Simply Expressive'). Stridently anti-Romantic, concerned to keep humanity in its place as just one of Earth's species, he did not believe that an especially harmonious world was possible, and he abhorred all attempts to escape the world, whether through mystical or poetical exaltations. His one hope, or consolation, explicitly stated in St. Francis's Empty Sandal, was in the connection (never entirely peaceful) he felt with other members of the species. Decorations He was awarded the degree of Grand Officer of the Order of Saint James of the Sword. Marriages and children He married firstly on 27 December 1957 and divorced on 15 January 1971 television and film screenwriter, editor and director No√©mia Delgado.

It was originally built as a residential hotel by William Earle Dodge Stokes, the Phelps-Dodge copper heir and shareholder in the Ansonia Clock Company, and it was named for his grandfather, the industrialist Anson Greene Phelps. In 1897, Stokes commissioned French architect Paul Emile Duboy to design the grandest hotel in Manhattan. Stokes would list himself as \\"architect-in-chief\\" for the project and hired Duboy, a sculptor who designed and made the ornamental sculptures on the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, to draw up the plans. New Orleans architect Martin Shepard served as draftsman and assistant superintendent of construction on the project.Shepard, Martin. Undated resume. Martin Shepard Office Records, Southeastern Architectural Archive, Special Collections Division, Tulane University Libraries. The assignee of the contractor proceed against Stokes in 1907, suing for $90,000. But Stokes would defend himself, explaining that Duboy was in an insane asylum in Paris, and it was his belief that he was insane when, in 1903, he signed the final certificate on the plans, and should not have been making commitments in Stokes's name concerning the hotel.A West Side Developer's Other Side = New York Times ‚Äì August 28, 2005 In what might be the earliest harbinger of the current developments in urban farming, Stokes established a small farm on the roof of the hotel, where he kept farm animals next to his personal apartment. There was a cattle elevator, which enabled dairy cows to be stabled on the roof. Note: This includes and Accompanying nine photographs Stokes had a Utopian vision for the Ansonia‚Äîthat it could be self-sufficient, or at least contribute to its own support‚Äîwhich led to perhaps the strangest New York apartment amenity ever. \\"The farm on the roof,\\" Weddie Stokes wrote years later, \\"included about 500 chickens, many ducks, about six goats and a small bear.\\" Every day, a bellhop delivered free fresh eggs to all the tenants, and any surplus was sold cheaply to the public in the basement arcade. Not much about this feature charmed the city fathers, however, and in 1907, the Department of Health shut down the farm in the sky.The Building of the Upper West Side = New York Magazine ‚Äì May 21, 2005 History The Ansonia was a residential hotel. The residents lived in \\"luxurious\\" apartments with multiple bedrooms, parlors, libraries, and formal dining rooms that were often round or oval. Apartments featured views north and south along Broadway, high ceilings, \\"elegant\\" moldings, and bay windows. There were three thousand rooms. Arrangements could be made to rent a suite varying in size from a room and a bath to thirty rooms. Some of these suites were rented for $14,000 a year, the equivalent of more than $400,000 in 2018. The smaller units, with one bedroom, parlor, and bath, lacked kitchens. There was a central kitchen and serving kitchens on every floor, so that the residents could enjoy the services of professional chefs while dining in their own apartments. Besides the usual array of tearooms, restaurants, and a grand ballroom, the Ansonia had Turkish baths and a lobby fountain with live seals. Erected between 1899 and 1904, it was the largest residential hotel of its day and the first air-conditioned hotel in New York. The building has an eighteen- story steel-frame structure. The exterior is decorated in the Beaux-Art style with a Parisian style mansard roof. The Ansonia features round corner-towers or turrets and an open stairwell that sweeps up to a domed skylight. Ansonia Hotel The building's copper cornices were removed during World War II and melted down for the war effort.\\"The City, From Wartime Grit to Modern Soullessness,\\" New York Times, Jan 29, 2010, The Ansonia has had many celebrated residents, including baseball player Babe Ruth; writer Theodore Dreiser, in 1912; the leader of the Bah√°'√≠ Faith \`Abdu'l-Bah√°; Nobel prize winner in literature Isaac Bashevitz Singer; conductor Arturo Toscanini; composer Igor Stravinsky; fashion designer Koos van den Akker; and Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. By the mid-twentieth-century, the grand apartments had mostly been divided into studios and one-bedroom units, almost all of which retained their original architectural detail. After a short debate in the 1960s, a proposal to demolish the building was fought off by its many musical and artistic residents. From 1977 until 1980, The Ansonia Hotel's basement was home to Plato's Retreat, an open door swinger sex club. Prior to Plato's Retreat, the building housed the Continental Baths, operated by Steve Ostrow, a gay bathhouse where Bette Midler provided musical entertainment early in her career, with Barry Manilow as her accompanist. In 1980, the building was inducted to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1992, the Ansonia was converted to a condominium apartment building with 430 apartments. By 2007, most of the rent-controlled apartment tenants had moved out, and the small apartments were sold to buyers who purchased clusters of small apartments and threw them together to recreate grand apartments. The Ansonia is home to part of the New York campus of the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Scandals Helen Godman (1919) calling herself \\"Alice\\" *In 1916, the Ansonia was the scene of a blackmail plot. Edward R. West, Vice President of the C. D. Gregg Tea and Coffee Company of Chicago, had checked into the hotel with a woman known to him as Alice Williams. Alice Williams was an alias of Helen Godman, also known as \\"Buda\\" Godman, who acted as the \\"lure\\" for a blackmail gang based in Chicago. West and Godman were together in their room at The Ansonia when two male members of the gang, impersonating Federal law enforcement agents, entered the room and \\"arrested\\" West for violation of the Mann Act. After transporting West and Godman back to Chicago, West was coerced into paying the two \\"agents\\" $15,000 in order to avoid prosecution, and avoid embarrassment or soiling the reputation of \\"Alice.\\" West reported the incident after becoming suspicious that not everything was as it seemed.

Laurel Canyon Boulevard is a major street in the city of Los Angeles. It starts off at Polk Street in Sylmar in the northern San Fernando Valley near the junction of the San Diego (Interstate 405) and the Golden State (I-5)) freeways. Laurel Canyon Boulevard bypasses the city of San Fernando to the west, running parallel to I-5 in the vicinity of Pacoima and Arleta. The portion through Sun Valley passes through rock quarries and a great deal of open space. From the intersection with Webb Avenue, Laurel Canyon Boulevard heads due south, cutting through North Hollywood, closely following the Hollywood Freeway (SR 170). Laurel Canyon Boulevard passes through the Valley Village neighborhood, one mile (1.6 km) west of the Hollywood Split (the intersection of the Hollywood (U.S. 101/SR 170) and Ventura (U.S. 101/SR 134) freeways). This would have been the start of the proposed Laurel Canyon Freeway, which would have provided a direct freeway connection from the southeastern San Fernando Valley to the Los Angeles International Airport. The proposed route was along the current routing of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, but the emergence of the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a movie star enclave doomed the project, as did local opposition. Laurel Canyon itself found counterculture fame in the 1960s as home to many of L.A.'s top rock musicians, such as Frank Zappa. The bohemian spirit endures; every year, residents gather for a group photograph at the country market. Laurel Canyon Boulevard was also immortalized by The Doors in their 1968 song \\"Love Street.\\" Laurel Canyon Boulevard crosses Laurel Canyon G Line station at its intersection with Chandler Boulevard in Valley Village. Laurel Canyon Boulevard is served by Metro Local lines 218 (south of Ventura Boulevard) and 230 (north of Ventura Boulevard). South of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, Laurel Canyon Boulevard ascends the Santa Monica Mountains, where it maintains a width of four lanes until the intersection of Mulholland Drive. The road climbs up Lookout Mountain before descending into West Hollywood, passing through Hollywood Boulevard. Laurel Canyon Boulevard‚Äôs southern terminus is at its intersection with Sunset Boulevard and Crescent Heights Boulevard. Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon Avenue to the west between the southern San Fernando Valley and West Hollywood are also popular alternate routes to the Hollywood Freeway (US 101) during rush hour. Laurel Canyon Freeway The Laurel Canyon Freeway was to have been a north-south freeway in Central Los Angeles and its suburbs. It derived its name from Laurel Canyon, the proposed route by which the freeway would traverse the Santa Monica Mountains. Its proposed alignment was from the intersection of the Hollywood Freeway (U.S. Route 101) and the Ventura Freeway (California State Route 134) in the southeastern San Fernando Valley ‚Äî to the San Diego Freeway (I-405) near Los Angeles International Airport. However, the emerging popularity of Laurel Canyon as a movie star enclave in the 1960s ultimately doomed the project. The only portion of the freeway that was built was a small section of La Cienega Boulevard through the Baldwin Hills district of southwestern Los Angeles. History In 1919 Harry Houdini rented the cottage at 2435 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, while making movies for Lasky Pictures. His wife occupied it for a time after his death. As of 2011 that site was a vacant lot. The main mansion building itself was rebuilt after it was destroyed in the 1959 Laurel Canyon fire, and is now a historic venue. While Houdini did not likely live at the \\"mansion,\\" there is some probability that his widow did.

He called for government reform and the release of detained Shia leaders. The growth of his popularity, often referred to as the followers of the Vocal Hawza, also put him in competition with other Shi'a leaders, including Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim who was exiled in Iran.  Biography  al-Sadr was born to Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr (1906‚Äì1986), the grandson of Ismail al-Sadr, the patriarch of the Lebanese al- Sadr family and a first cousin of Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr and Amina al-Sadr. Following the Gulf War, Shi'ites in Southern Iraq went into open rebellion. A number of provinces overthrew the Baathist entities and rebelled against Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party. The leadership of the Shi'ite rebellion as well as the Shi'ite doctrine in Iraq was split between Ayatollah Ali Al- Sistani and Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq Al-Sadr. Al-Sadr, based in Baghdad, appealed to the younger, more radical Shi'ites from the more impoverished areas of Southern Iraq. The Shi'ites travelled to Baghdad from these poor areas to join Al-Sadr and his Shi'ite leadership. The area which Al-Sadr preached in and these poor Shi'ites occupied became known as \\"Revolution Township\\". In this ghetto, Sadr established a secret network of devoted followers and he became an increasingly prominent figure in the Iraqi political scene. As a result of the disenfranchisement and repression of the Shi'ites in Iraq and the loyalty of the local populations, Saddam Hussein and his Baathist government could not control the Revolution Township on a neighbourhood level. Their lack of control limited their ability to affect al- Sadr's power base and the devotion of his followers. Revolution Township was renamed Saddam City, an acute definition of the poverty and oppression Saddam brought to the Shi'ites in the span of his reign over Iraq. As his power grew, al-Sadr became more and more involved in politics following the Gulf War, and throughout the 1990s, he openly defied Saddam. He organized the poor Shi'ites of Sadr City, yet another nickname for the impoverished Shi'ite ghetto in Baghdad, against Saddam and the Baath Party. Sadr gained the support of the Shi'ites by reaching out to tribal villages and offering services to them that they would otherwise not have been afforded by Hussein's regime. Saddam began to crack down on the Shi'ite leaders in the late 1990s in an attempt to regain control of Iraq. Sometime before his death, al-Sadr was informed of Saddam's limited patience with him. In defiance, al-Sadr wore his death shroud to his final Friday sermon to show that the Shi'ites would not be intimidated by Saddam's oppression and that Sadr would preach the truth even if it meant his own death. He was later killed leaving the mosque in the Iraqi city of Najaf along with two of his sons as they drove through the town. Their car was ambushed by men, and both his sons were killed by gunfire while he was severely injured. He died an hour later in the hospital. Shi'as in Iraq, as well as most international observers, suspect the Iraqi Baathist government of being involved in, if not directly responsible for, their murders. Anger at, among other things, the government's involvement in Sadr's death helped spark the 1999 Shia uprising in Iraq. Following the fall of Baghdad, the majority- Shi'a suburb of Revolution City (Saddam City) was unofficially but popularly renamed to Sadr City in his honour. Sadr City was the first part of Baghdad to overthrow the Baath Party in 2003. Mohammad al-Sadr's son, Muqtada al-Sadr, is currently the leader of the Sadrist movement and bases his legitimacy upon his relationship to his father. He led a guerrilla uprising against Coalition forces and the new Iraqi government as part of the Iraqi Insurgency between 2004 and 2008.

Plot Civilian scientist Jason Eldridge runs Magnetic Analyzer Computing Synchrotron (MACS), a vacuum tube computer aboard the United States Navy ship USS Elmira. He and his friend Lt. Ferguson Howard realize that, by using MACS to record a roulette table's spins over time, the computer can predict future results. Howard and LTJG Beauregard Gilliam check into a Venice casino's hotel dressed as civilians with Eldridge, defying Admiral Fitch's order that naval officers on shore avoid the casino and wear uniforms. They plan to use signal lamps to communicate with a confederate manning MACS on the Elmira. At the hotel, dedicated bachelor Howard meets and romances Julie Fitch, the admiral's daughter. Eldridge reunites with former girlfriend and heiress Pam Dunstan, in Venice to marry another man. The betting system is very effective, and the three men accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars in casino chips; the money gives Eldridge the confidence to propose to Dunstan.

Since then, his work has continued to be shown all over Europe and America. Work  Through efficient and often humorous gestures, Bismuth interrupts pre-established codes of reading the images and objects that pervade daily life, from headline stories in newspapers to magazine clippings from gentlemen's magazines, to even the color of the walls. In his series From Red to Nothing and From Green to Something Else, Bismuth reproduces a painted wall in each exhibition, subtly altering the color by the addition of a small amount of white or colored paint to the original color. Another series Something less, Something More (2002‚Äì2006) consists of thin partitions out of which Bismuth removes circles until as little material as possible remained, while the circles removed from the partitions accumulate on the floor. Replaced by the Same (2003), Bismuth plays on the idea of substituting one thing by its double: for each photograph in this series, elements taken from duplicates are glued on exactly the same place as they were on the originals.Bismuth bio at MACBA's website Collaborations A striking aspect of Bismuth's artistic practice consists in his collaborations with other artists from the most various fields.

The name passed to Italian as Agnese, to Portuguese as In√™s, and to Spanish as In√©s. The name is a cognate of the Proto-Indo-European fire god *h‚ÇÅnÃ•g ∑nis, which is also known in Hinduism as the Vedic fire god Agni. It was the name of a popular Christian saint, Agnes of Rome, which encouraged its wide use. Agnes was the third most popular name for women in the English speaking world for more than 400 years.Rosenkrantz, Linda, and Satran, Pamela Redmond (2007). Baby Name Bible. St. Martin's Griffin. Its medieval pronunciation was Annis, and its usage and many of its forms coincided with the equally popular name Anna, related in medieval and Elizabethan times to Agnes, though Anne/Ann/Anna are derived from the Hebrew Hannah ('God favored me') rather than the Greek.\\"Shakespeare's Wife.\\" New York Times. 4-27-2008. It remained a widely used name throughout the 1960s in the United States. It was last ranked among the top 1,000 names for American baby girls during that decade. The peak of its popularity was between 1900 and 1920, when it was among the top fifty given names for American girls. Agnieszka was the sixth-most popular name for girls born in Poland in 2007, having risen as high as third place in Sweden and Poland in 2006. It was also ranked among the top one hundred names for baby girls born in Hungary in 2005.Behind the Name Ne≈æa, a Slovene shortened variant of the name, was ranked among the top ten names for baby girls born in Slovenia in 2008.

Equipment Dave's current bass for Spock's Beard is a custom built hybrid between a Fender and a Rickenbacker. It is an Alder Ric-shaped body that is contoured like a Fender, with bolt-on Fender Jazz style neck. Dave used four Seymour Duncan Apollo Jazz Bass pickups to do this - two in the Rickenbacker locations and two in the positions where the P / J pickus on a Fender Jazz Bass would normally go. Further customizations include a Full Contact Hardware bridge and a Hipshot Xtender tuning key that will detune the E string down to a D at the flip of a lever. From 1992 through 2002 Dave used a stock white Rickenbacker in Spock's Beard. From 2002 through the recording of \\"X\\" (bass tracks recorded in November 2012) Dave's main bass was what he terms his \\"Fendenbacker\\". It's a Rickenbacker 4001 bass that's been severely modified to serve a variety of purposes. \\"A buddy of mine found a really trashed Ric in a pawn shop, and I turned it into a project bass to try to make a 'one bass fits all' for myself\\" says Meros. It has a set of Fender Jazz Bass pickups set in mid-'70s-era spacing (the bridge pickup moved closer to the bridge than in previous incarnations, giving the bass a \\"tighter\\" and more midrange tone) as well as the standard set of Rickenbacker pickups in the traditional Ric positions. This gives Meros four pickups total to choose from, with a switch that chooses between the two fairly different \\"basses\\", Rickenbacker or Jazz. All four can also be activated at the same time. A BadAss bridge, Hipshot Bass Xtender (otherwise known as a \\"Hipshot D-Tuner\\" or simply a \\"Hipshot\\" or \\"D-Tuner\\" among bassists) for its ability to downtune the low E-string of a bass typically to D at the flip of a lever) and a string mute that Meros can raise or lower with thumb screws (which were fabricated by Meros himself) were also added. \\"I did the refinish on the front of the bass, made the pickguard and did a lot of the other little stuff myself, but I had John Carruthers (Venice, CA) do the stuff that really mattered, like route the body for the two extra pickups, cause you only get one chance to do that, and it has to be perfect. He's the man, totally. He also did a really versatile wiring thing for me and one of the most amazing fret jobs I've ever seen.\\" More recently, after the neck began delaminating from the body, it was completely rebuilt and refinished by Ed Roman Guitars, a company based in Las Vegas, NV. In 2007 Ed Roman built Dave a custom instrument designed with most of the same features and specs as the \\"Fendenbacker\\" (see below), with a Rickenbacker-like body shape but with a Fender scale length and neck width and more of a Fender body contouring. Other basses Meros uses are various Fender Jazz and Precision models (One of his Fender Precision basses was used on 2005's \\"Gluttons For Punishment\\" tour\\" while the Rickenbacker was being repaired), a Carruthers five string, and other fretted and fretless basses.

Outside Italy, it is sometimes known as Sangue Napolitano (\\"Neapolitan Blood\\"). Plot Assunta Spina is a laundress living in Naples, engaged to a violent butcher named Michele Mangiafuoco. She is also courted intensely by Raffaele. When she accepts Raffaele's offer to dance during an open air feast in Posillipo, as she feels Michele is ignoring her, tragedy strikes. Michele, blinded by rage, slashes her face and is subsequently arrested. During the trial she bears witness in order to rescue him, saying he never wounded her, but the jury does not believe her. She is enticed by the court vice-chancellor to strike a bargain‚ÄîMichele will stay in the nearby prison of Naples instead of Avellino, and at the end of the punishment Michele will kill the vice-chancellor before Assunta's eyes. She must take responsibility for the act before the eyes of the police in order to save her man. Production The original novel from which the story was taken was written by Salvatore di Giacomo, and had been adapted to a successful theatre drama in 1909. Before Francesca Bertini became a famous actress, she would perform in this drama as a walk-on in the laundry scenes. Five years later, when she had started her career as a film actress, she and actor-director Gustavo Serena adapted the drama for film. Bertini is sometimes listed as co-director of the film. Bertini claimed with some support that she was the director of the film. The film stock was colorized with 4 colors and distributed worldwide by Caesar Film. Cast *Francesca Bertini - Assunta Spina *Gustavo Serena - Michele Boccadifuoco *Carlo Benetti - Don Federigo Funelli *Luciano Albertini - Raffaele *Amelia Cipriani - Peppina *Antonio Cruichi - Assunta's father *Alberto Collo - Officer *Alberto Albertini Legacy Francesca Bertini fully displayed her talent for the first time, introducing a new style of acting on the Italian silver screen. Her performance is generally rated as extraordinary, and in polar opposition to the work of writer and dramatist Gabriele D'Annunzio who was very popular at the time. Scene from Assunta Spina For example, the movie Cabiria by Giovanni Pastrone (1914)‚Äîone of the first known films where a camera moves through scenes while filming‚Äîwas once considered a masterpiece at least in part because D'Annunzio had written the captions, but to modern moviegoers they seem excessively emphatic and redundant. The same can be said of the marked gestures of many actors and actresses of the silent era. Bertini wanted to end this affected behavior, so she focused on realism. Her performances bear a closer resemblance to reality because of some acting devices: never look into the camera, use everyday gestures, and so on. The lunch scene in Assunta Spina, for example, still has impact because of these devices. The attempt to reflect reality also reduced the need for captions explaining the action. Even though only a single year passed between the release of Cabiria and Assunta Spina, there seems to be at least a decade's worth of difference in artistic subtlety and nuance. Other versions In 1930 the plot of Assunta Spina inspired a new film by Roberto Roberti. Another was produced in 1948, directed by Mario Mattoli, with Anna Magnani and Eduardo De Filippo as the protagonists.

History Formed in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by the members of three other punk bands, The Stillborns, Maimed, and Paranoid, the band began writing their own material and covering contemporary punk bands such as The Mekons. After several gigs in and around Belfast, the band recorded their first demo and began playing in the Belfast Anarchy Centre, supporting other anarcho-punk bands such as The Poison Girls and Crass. In the early 80's line-up changes and hostility from National Front activists plagued the band. In 1983, punk venues were formed around Belfast, notably the Manhattan near Belfast city centre as well as The Labour Club. This allowed a punk scene to develop within the city, with Stalag 17 playing alongside bands such as Asylum and Toxic Waste. Members of the band got involved with Belfast Anarchist bookshop Just Books and established connections with bands in the U.K. anarcho-punk scene such as Conflict, The Subhumans and DIRT. Conflict offered Stalag 17 a place on the Mortarhate compilation We Don't Want Your Fucking War, and the interest created by that compilation led to a split 12\\" with Toxic Waste, The Truth Will Be Heard. In 1985 the band left for an ill- fated seven date tour of Scotland and England, beginning in Edinburgh where they supported the later to be famous Primal Scream and Shop Assistants. During this tour over half the gigs were cancelled (without prior notice) and the band had to spend all their money repairing their tour van and eventually resorted to siphoning their way back home. On their return the band released their first 'proper' demo 'From Belfast with Love' (titled so in reaction to Mortorhate's decision to catalogue 'The Truth Will be Heard' 12\\" as 'From Belfast with Blood' - without either of the band's consent and much to their disgust). The demo was a collection of studio tracks and a live recording from The Station in Gateshead. During the rest of 1985 the band recorded a track for the Words of Warning label's first release 'You Are Not Alone' alongside Oi Polloi and then in 1986 spent a more successful three-week tour in Europe. 1986 also saw the band recording tracks for the 'We Will be Free' album, which also hosted Toxic Waste and Asylum. The band recorded two more demos (\\"And All the Birdies Sang Fuck This for a Lark\\" and \\"Erection 87\\"). In 1987 the band played 2 gigs in Scotland. However, general dissatisfaction within the band meant the gigs would be their last. The demo 17 from 17 was released after the bands demise. Petesy, the band's vocalist was later to play in FUAL and join Northern Irish 'Punk Supergroup' Shame Academy comprising ex members of Rudi and The Outcasts. More recently Petesy, Mickey (the original drummer) and Joe (bass player) formed A-Political with Ali Curry. Discography * \\"Society's Fairytale\\" on We Don't Want Your Fucking War!

However, he has to stay in Jakhal before attacking Bhorki. He was kind of impressed with the natural beauty of the area and decided to conquer the area from the local warlord. The warlord decided to keep quiet because he knew the stories about Salehadi Singh's bravery. Jakhal Fort In 1735, Salehadi Singh built a bastion (burj) in Jakhal. It is believed that Sikar's king Laxaman Singh destroyed parts of this burj in a cannon attack. The remains of this burj is still there (see photo right).

This page contains terms starting with D ‚Äì F. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. D * Deemed university: ‚ÄòDeemed-to-be-University‚Äô, Status of autonomy granted to high performing institutes and departments of various universities in India by Government of India. * Distance: (or distance learning) A field of education that focuses on the pedagogy/andragogy, technology, and instructional systems design that is effectively incorporated in delivering education to students who are not physically \\"on site\\" to receive their education. Instead, teachers and students may communicate asynchronously (at times of their own choosing) by exchanging printed or electronic media, or through technology that allows them to communicate in real time (synchronously). Distance education courses that require a physical on-site presence for any reason including the taking of examinations is considered to be a hybrid or blended course or program. * Dunce: A person incapable of learning. The word is derived from the name of the great schoolman, John Duns Scotus, whose works on logic, theology and philosophy were accepted textbooks in the universities from the 14th century. * Dyslexia: Said to be a neurological disorder with biochemical and genetic markers. Dyslexia was originally defined as a difficulty with reading and writing that could not be explained by general intelligence. One diagnostic approach is to compare their ability in areas such as reading and writing to that which would be predicted by his or her general level of intelligence, but some would say that it is not certain that intelligence should be a predictor of reading or writing ability; and also that the causes, effects and treatments of reading disabilities may be similar for all levels of intelligence. E * Early childhood education: Covers the education of a child from the period from birth to eight years of age. * Education: A social science that encompasses teaching and learning specific knowledge, beliefs, and skills. Licensed and practicing teachers in the field use a variety of methods and materials in order to impart a curriculum. * Education policy: is the collection of rules, both stated and implicit, or the regularities in practice that govern the behavior of persons in schools. Education policy analysis is the scholarly study of education policy. * Education reform: A plan, program, or movement which attempts to bring about a systematic change in educational theory or practice across a community or society. * Education voucher: (commonly called a school voucher) A certificate by which parents are given the ability to pay for the education of their children at a school of their choice, rather than the public school to which they were assigned. These vouchers would be paid for using tax revenues. * Educational animation: Animation produced for the specific purpose of fostering learning. * Educational counseling: Conducted by counselors in schools and universities. It is intended to help children suffering from education-related traumas such as beatings and other forms of corporal punishment used in many countries. A more common application is with children who have been abused or bullied. The counselor works with the child to help him or her get over the trauma he or she has suffered. * Educational evaluation: The evaluation process of characterizing and appraising some aspect of the education enterprise. * Educational film: A film or movie whose primary purpose is to educate. Educational films have been used in classrooms as an alternative to other teaching methods. * Educational games: Games, including video games of this genre, designed to teach people, typically children, about a certain subject or help them learn a skill as they play. Some people call these types of games edutainment because they combine education and entertainment. * Educational leadership: Leadership in formal educational settings. It draws upon interdisciplinary literature, generally, but ideally distinguishes itself through its focus on pedagogy, epistemology and human development. In contemporary practice it borrows from political science and business. Debate within the field relates to this tension. * Educational organization: Organization within the scope of education. It is a common misconception that this means it is organizing educational system; rather, it deals with the theory of organization as it applies to education of the human mind. * Educational perennialism: Perennialists believe that one should teach the things that they believe are of everlasting importance to all people everywhere. They believe that the most important topics develop a person. Since details of fact change constantly, these cannot be the most important. Therefore, one should teach principles, not facts. Since people are human, one should teach first about humans, not machines or techniques. Since people are people first, and workers second if at all, one should teach liberal topics first, not vocational topics. * Educational programming language: A programming language that is designed primarily as a learning instrument and not so much as a tool for writing real-world application programs. * Educational psychology: The study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational treatments, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. Although the terms \\"educational psychology\\" and \\"school psychology\\" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as educational psychologists, whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as school psychologists. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment among the general population and sub-populations such as gifted children and those subject to specific disabilities. * Educational research: Research conducted to investigate behavioral patterns in pupils, students, teachers and other participants in schools and other educational institutions. Such research is often conducted by examining work products such as documents and standardized test results. The methods of educational research are derived chiefly from the social sciences, and in particular from psychology. * Educational software: Computer software whose primary purpose is teaching or self-learning. * Educational technology: The use of technology to improve education. It is a systematic, iterative process for designing instruction or training used to improve performance. Educational technology is sometimes also known as instructional technology or learning technology. * E-learning: An approach to facilitate and enhance learning through, and based on, both computer and communications technology. Such devices can include personal computers, CD- ROMs, Digital Television, P.D.A.s and Mobile Phones. Communications technology enables the use of the Internet, email, discussion forums, collaborative software and team learning systems (see also online deliberation). * Electronic portfolio: In the context of education and learning, an electronic portfolio, normally known as an ePortfolio or a digital portfolio, is a portfolio based on electronic media and services. It consists of a personal digital record containing information such as a collection of artifacts or evidence demonstrating what one knows and can do. * Empirical knowledge: (or a posteriori knowledge) Propositional knowledge obtained by experience or sensorial information. It is contrasted with a priori knowledge, or knowledge that is gained through the apprehension of innate ideas, \\"intuition,\\" \\"pure reason,\\" or other non-experiential sources. The natural and social sciences are usually considered a posteriori, literally \\"after the fact,\\" disciplines. Mathematics and logic are usually considered a priori, \\"before the fact,\\" disciplines. * Engagement: The sentiment a student feels or does not feel towards learning or the learning environment. * Epistemic theories of truth: Attempts to analyse the notion of truth in terms of epistemic notions such as \\"belief\\", \\"acceptance\\", \\"verification\\", \\"justification\\", \\"perspective\\" and so on. There is a variety of such conceptions, and they may be classified into verificationist theories and perspectivalist and relativist theories. :Verificationism is based on a certain kind of mental activity: \\"verifying\\" a proposition. The distinctive claim of verificationism is that the result of such verifications is, by definition, truth. That is, truth is reducible to this process of verification. :According to perspectivalism and relativism, a proposition is only true relative to a particular perspective. Roughly, a proposition is true relative to a perspective if and only if it is \\"accepted\\" or \\"endorsed\\" or \\"legitimated\\" somehow by that perspective. * Epistemology: (from the Greek words episteme (knowledge) and logos (word/speech)) The branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin and scope of knowledge. Historically, it has been one of the most investigated and most debated of all philosophical subjects. Much of this debate has focused on analysing the nature and variety of knowledge and how it relates to similar notions such as truth and belief. Much of this discussion concerns the justification of knowledge claims, that is the grounds on which one can claim to know a particular fact. * Exchange student: A student (usually from high school or university) who temporarily goes abroad and lives with a host family in a foreign country, and attends school there. That host family often also sends a child of theirs abroad, usually to the same country as the student they are hosting. In this way, the two students are said to have been \\"exchanged,\\" essentially temporarily trading countries with each other, although the period of exchange may not necessarily be simultaneous. The main purpose of exchange programs is to increase cultural understanding, both for the student and the people in the host country he/she comes into contact with. Exchanges are often arranged by organizations created for this purpose, called student exchange programs. Youth For Understanding and American Field Service are two examples of these organizations. * Experience: Comprises knowledge of or skill in or observation of some thing or some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing or event. The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the concept of experiment. :The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience \\"empirical knowledge\\" or \\"a posteriori knowledge\\". A person with considerable experience in a certain field can gain a reputation as an expert. * Experiential education: (or \\"learning by doing\\") The process of actively engaging students in an authentic experience that will have benefits and consequences. Students make discoveries and experiment with knowledge themselves instead of hearing or reading about the experiences of others. Students also reflect on their experiences, thus developing new skills, new attitudes, and new theories or ways of thinking. Experiential education is related to the constructivist learning theory. * Experimental analysis of behavior: The name given to the approach to psychology founded by B. F. Skinner. As its name suggests, its foundational principle was the rejection of theoretical analysis, in particular the kinds of learning theory that had grown up in the comparative psychology of the 1920-1950 period, in favor of a more direct approach. It owed its early success to the effectiveness of Skinner's procedure of operant conditioning, both in the laboratory and in behavior therapy. * Expulsion (education): Removing a student from a school or university for violating rules or academic honor codes. * Extra credit is an academic concept, particularly used in schools. Students are offered the opportunity to undertake optional work, additional to their compulsory school work, in order to gain additional credit that would boost their grades. * Extracurricular activities: Activities performed by students that fall outside the realm of the normal curriculum of school or university education. Extracurricular activities exist at all levels of education, from high school and college to university education. Such activities are generally voluntary as opposed to mandatory, non-paying, tend to be social or philanthropic as opposed to scholastic, and involve others of the same age. Students often organize and direct these activities under faculty sponsorship. F * Forbidden knowledge: (in contrast to secret knowledge) Used to describe forbidden books or other information to which access is restricted or deprecated for political or religious reasons. Forbidden knowledge is commonly not secret, rather a society or various institutions will use repressive mechanisms to either completely prevent the publication of information they find objectionable or dangerous (censorship), or failing that, to try to reduce the public's trust in such information (propaganda). Public repression can create paradoxical situation where the proscribed information is generally common knowledge but publicly citing it is disallowed. * Functional illiteracy: Refers to the inability of an individual to use reading, speaking, writing, and computational skills efficiently in everyday life situations. Unlike an illiterate, a functionally illiterate adult could be able to read and write text in his native language (with a variable degree of grammatical correctness, speed, and style), but is unable like the first, even in his own cultural and linguistic environment, to perform such fundamental tasks as filling out an application for employment, following written instructions, reading a newspaper, reading traffic signs, consulting a dictionary, or understanding a bus schedule. * Future Problem Solving Program: (FPSP) An international academic competition. Over 250,000 students internationally participate in the Future Problem Solving program every year. Participating countries include the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Hong Kong and Singapore.

H., Signal processing handbook, Dekker, New York, 1988 This feature has been used heavily in both speech recognition and music information retrieval, being a key feature to classify percussive sounds.Gouyon F., Pachet F., Delerue O. (2000),On the Use of Zero- crossing Rate for an Application of Classification of Percussive Sounds, in Proceedings of the COST G-6 Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFX-00 - DAFX-06), Verona, Italy, December 7‚Äì9, 2000. Accessed 26 April 2011. ZCR is defined formally as :zcr = \\\\frac{1}{T-1} \\\\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \\\\mathbb{1}_{ \\\\mathbb{R}_{< 0} } (s_t s_{t-1}) where s is a signal of length T and \\\\mathbb{1}_{ \\\\mathbb{R}_{< 0} } is an indicator function. In some cases only the \\"positive-going\\" or \\"negative-going\\" crossings are counted, rather than all the crossings - since, logically, between a pair of adjacent positive zero-crossings there must be one and only one negative zero-crossing. For monophonic tonal signals, the zero-crossing rate can be used as a primitive pitch detection algorithm.

Directed by Sara G√≥mez, the film mixes documentary-style footage with a fictional story that looks at the poor neighborhoods of Havana shortly after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. The film illustrates the history before the background of the development process in Cuba. It demonstrates how tearing down slums and building modern settlements does not immediately change the culture of the inhabitants. G√≥mez completed filming with Mario Balmaseda and Yolanda Cuellar just before her death; technical work was finished by Tom√°s Guti√©rrez Alea, Julio Garc√≠a-Espinosa y Rigoberto L√≥pez before its posthumous release. Plot Yolanda, a female teacher, cannot find the best methods to teach the marginalized children of the slums because of their different origin. Mario, a worker in a bus factory and a typical macho man, is confronted by Yolanda's instinct for emancipation. The two nonetheless become lovers. Their relationship portrays the idea that racism, sexism, and class- based prejudices must be demolished in order to succeed. Reception The film does not contain action in the traditional sense, but it portrays, through an unusual mixture of documentary-style modules and fiction, the conflicts in Cuban society that remain unsolved today. As De cierta manera reveals, G√≥mez was a revolutionary filmmaker with intersecting concerns: the Afro-Cuban community, its cultural traditions (including Abaku√° and Santer√≠a), women's issues, the treatment of marginalized sectors of society, and the role of family within the context of the revolution and workers' rights. For its time, the film was extremely radical both in form and content. Hence, Sara G√≥mez remains one of the most significant filmmakers from Latin America.

They are a generalized type of Brenke polynomial, and generalize the Appell polynomials. See also Sheffer sequence. Definition The q-difference polynomials satisfy the relation :\\\\left(\\\\frac {d}{dz}\\\\right)_q p_n(z) = \\\\frac{p_n(qz)-p_n(z)} {qz-z} = \\\\frac{q^n-1} {q-1} p_{n-1}(z)=[n]_qp_{n-1}(z) where the derivative symbol on the left is the q-derivative. In the limit of q\\\\to 1, this becomes the definition of the Appell polynomials: :\\\\frac{d}{dz}p_n(z) = np_{n-1}(z). Generating function The generalized generating function for these polynomials is of the type of generating function for Brenke polynomials, namely :A(w)e_q(zw) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{p_n(z)}{[n]_q!} w^n where e_q(t) is the q-exponential: :e_q(t)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^n}{[n]_q!}= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^n (1-q)^n}{(q;q)_n}.

It was first synthesized by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in 1962. It possesses hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Nimetazepam is also an anticonvulsant. It is sold in 5 mg tablets known as Erimin and Lavol. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. The sole global manufacturer of Nimetazepam (Sumitomo Japan) has ceased manufacturing Erimin since early November 2015. Patients being prescribed Erimin are being switched to Lavol and other hypnotics, e.g. estazolam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, etc. Pharmacokinetics Taken orally, Nimetazepam has very good bioavailability with nearly 100% being absorbed from the gut. It is among the most rapidly absorbed and quickest acting oral benzodiazepines, and hypnotic effects are typically felt within 15‚Äì30 minutes after oral ingestion. The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short half- life ranging from 0.5‚Äì0.7 hours and the terminal half-life from 8 to 26.5 hours (mean 17.25 hours). It is the N-methylated analogue of nitrazepam (Mogadon, Alodorm), to which it is partially metabolized. nitrazepam has a long elimination half-life, so effects of repeated dosage tend to be cumulative. Recreational use There is a risk of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of Nimetazepam. The pharmacological properties of Nimetazepam such as high affinity binding, high potency, being short to intermediate ‚Äì acting and having a rapid onset of action increase the abuse potential of Nimetazepam. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of Nimetazepam also adds to the addictive nature of Nimetazepam. Nimetazepam has a particular reputation in South East Asia for recreational use, at around USD 7 per tab, and is particularly popular among persons addicted to amphetamines or opioids. Stimulant addicts do not have healthy coping mechanisms due to the nature of addiction, causing insomnia, depression and exhaustion. In addition, Nimetazepam has an anti-depressant and muscle relaxant effect. Nimetazepam also has withdrawal suppression effect and lower drug seeking versus nitrazepam in rhesus monkey (Macaca Mulatta). which might help stimulant addicts to overcome withdrawal symptoms. Drug misuse Nimetazepam has a reputation for being particularly subject to abuse (known as 'Happy 5', sold as an ecstasy replacement without a hangover). Although is still a significant drug of abuse in some Asian countries such as Japan and Malaysia, Nimetazepam is subject to legal restrictions in Malaysia, and due to its scarcity, many tablets sold on the black market are in fact counterfeits containing other benzodiazepines such as diazepam or nitrazepam instead. Legal status In the United States, Nimetazepam is categorized Schedule IV FDA and DEA. Nimetazepam is currently a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. In Singapore, Nimetazepam is a physician prescribed drug, and is regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The illegal possession or consumption of Nimetazepam is punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment, a fine of 20,000 Singapore dollars, or both. Importing or exporting nimetazepam is punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment and/or caning. In Hong Kong, Nimetazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Nimetazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time. Similarly in Taiwan and Indonesia Nimetazepam is also regulated as a controlled prescribed substance. In Victoria Australia, nimetazepam is regulated under Schedule 11 of \\"Drugs, Poisons and Controlled substances act 1981\\". It is deemed to fall under the category of \\"7-NITRO-1,4-BENZODIAZEPINES not included elsewhere in this Part\\". . Toxicity In a rat study Nimetazepam showed greater damage to the fetus, as did nitrazepam when compared against other benzodiazepines, all at a dosage of 100 mg/kg. Diazepam however showed relatively weak fetal toxicities. The same fetotoxicity of nitrazepam could not be observed in mice and is likely due to the particular metabolism of the drug in the rat. In a rat study nimetazepam showed slight enlargement of the liver and adrenals and atrophy of the testes and ovaries were found in high dose groups of both drugs at the 4th and 12th week, however, in histopathological examination, there were no change in the liver, adrenals and ovaries. Degenerative changes of seminiferous epithelium in the testes were observed, but these atrophic change returned to normal by withdrawal of the drugs for 12 weeks.

His sons attended the High School of Glasgow and his daughters St. George's School for Girls, Edinburgh. Death and legacy At a Water Board outing he was taken ill and never recovered, dying in 1927. The local newspaper at the time remembered him as a 'bright and cheery man', and notes that he 'took a deep interest in parochial affairs and was particularly sympathetic towards the deserving poor'. Thomas Howie is buried in Falkirk Cemetery. On his death, his share of the brickworks business was valued at ¬£12,000, which is equivalent to over ¬£2,300,000 in today's terms (relative GDP per capita). Street named after him A street, Howie Place, in Falkirk, is named after him. It is nearby the site of the brickworks he once owned.

Cape Norman first appeared on French maps as Cape Dordois, in 1713, and then as Cape Normand in 1744. Eventually, the name became anglicised to Cape Norman. Cape Norman Lighthouse The Canadian government built a wooden, hexagonal lighthouse at Cape Norman during the summer construction seasons of 1870 and 1871, and the lighthouse was lit for the first time on 1 October 1871. In 1890, following the wreck of the SS Montreal at Belle Isle the previous summer, a steam-operated fog alarm was installed at the lightstation. John Campbell, a steam engineer from Pictou, Nova Scotia, was hired as lightkeeper and fog alarm engineer, replacing Henry Locke, the former lightkeeper. Campbell arrived at the cape in July 1890, beginning a family tenure which is currently operated by lightkeeper Warren Campbell.

Since it is classified as a hydrozoan, it is one of many jellyfish that are also known as hydromedusae. Hydromedusan jellyfish differ from scyphozoan jellyfish because they have a muscular, shelf-like structure called a velum on the ventral surface, attached to the bell margin. Originally from the Yangtze basin in China, C. sowerbii is an invasive species now found throughout the world in bodies of fresh water. Form C. sowerbii medusae are about 20‚Äì25 mm (approximately 1 in.) in diameter, somewhat flatter than a hemisphere, and very delicate, when fully grown. They have a whorl of up to 400 tentacles tightly packed around the bell margin. Hanging down from the center of the inside of the bell is a large stomach structure called a manubrium, with a mouth-opening with four frilly lips. Circulation of nutrients is facilitated by four radial canals which originate at the edges of the stomach (manubrium), and which are also connected to a ring canal, located near the bell margin. Most of the body is transparent or translucent, with a whitish or greenish tinge. The (usually) four large flat sex organs (gonads) are attached to the four radial canals, and are usually opaque white. The many tentacles each contain thousands of cells called cnidocytes, which contain nematocysts (also known as cnidocysts), and are used to capture prey and pass it to the mouth. Food is taken in the mouth opening, and waste is finally expelled out of the same opening. Habitat and distribution C. sowerbii is native to the Yangtze basin in China, but has been introduced on every continent except for Antarctica. It can be found in most American states (no reports yet from Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska or Hawaii) and most Canadian provinces (no reports yet from Alberta or Saskatchewan). It is usually found in calm, freshwater reservoirs, lakes, impoundments, gravel pits or quarries. It has also been seen in slow-moving backwaters of river systems such as the Allegheny River, the Ohio River and the Tennessee River in the United States and the Wang Thong River of Thailand. It is not generally seen in fast flowing streams or rivers. The medusa's appearance is sporadic and unpredictable from year to year. It is not uncommon for C. sowerbii to appear in a body of water where it had never been documented before, in very large numbers, and its appearance may even be reported on the local news. On August 21, 2010, C. sowerbii was spotted and captured on the northwest corner of Falcon Lake in Manitoba, Canada. Scientists believe this is due to a recent heat wave in the Whiteshell Provincial Park area. It is proposed the C. sowerbii came to Falcon Lake on waterfowl originating from Star Lake, Manitoba, Canada. Falcon Lake along with Star Lake remain the only two confirmed sightings of C. sowerbii in Manitoba. C. sowerbii has been seen in Pennsylvanian lakes and reservoirs including Marsh Creek Lake, Downingtown/Eagle, PA Turnpike/Rt 100/Rt 401, SR 282 (2007,2008). It has been found in water reservoirs and artificial lakes in south-eastern Australia, including the Thorndon Park reservoir and Lake Burley Griffin. It was reported in Panama in 1925, Chile in 1942, Argentina in 1950, Brazil in 1963, and in Uruguay in 1971. Since 2008 the freshwater jellyfish have been sighted every September and October in the Zhaojiaya Reservoir near Zhangjiajie, Hunan, China. It has been found in the Cauvery River and backwaters of the Hemavathi River in Karnataka, India and in several lakes in Hungary. During the abnormal heat in the summer 2010 in Russia sightings of C. sowerbii were reported in the Moscow River. Feeding C. sowerbii is a predator on zooplankton including daphnia and copepods. Prey is caught with their stinging tentacles. Drifting with its tentacles extended, the jelly waits for suitable prey to touch a tentacle. Once contact has been made, nematocysts on the tentacle fire into the prey, injecting poison which paralyzes the animal, and the tentacle itself coils around the prey. The tentacles then bring the prey into the mouth, where it is released and then digested. Just like salt water jellyfish they do have stinging cells. However, these cnidocytes cells are used for paralyzing very tiny prey and have not been proven to have the capacity to pierce human skin. Life cycle C. sowerbii begins life as a tiny polyp, which lives in colonies attached to underwater vegetation, rocks, or tree stumps, feeding and asexually reproducing during spring and summer. Some of these offspring are the sexually reproducing medusae. Fertilized eggs develop into small ciliated larvae called planula. The planula then settle to the bottom, and develop into polyps. However, the majority of C. sowerbii populations existing in the United States are either all male or all female, so there is no sexual reproduction in those populations. During the cold winter months, polyps contract and enter dormancy as resting bodies called podocysts. It is believed that podocysts are transported by aquatic plants or animals to other bodies of water. Once conditions become favorable, they develop into polyps again.

Biography He was the second son of Peter Hay of Megginch and Margaret, daughter of Patrick Ogilvy of Inchmartin. No date is recorded for his birth, but he was baptised 4 December 1570. Around 1588, Hay entered Scottish College at Douai, where he studied under his uncle Edmund Hay until 1596. He was initially introduced to court by his cousin the Earl of Carlisle. Hay served as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1596. On 18 February 1598, he was granted the Carthusian priory of Perth and a seat in Parliament, but, finding the rents too low to live on, he returned the peerage. On 15 November 1600, he was given land for his services to the King on the occasion of the Gowrie conspiracy. He was knighted sometime before 18 October 1607, when he first appeared in the records as Sir George Hay. He was appointed Lord Clerk Register and a member of the Privy Council on 26 March 1616. He was instrumental in the passage of the Five Articles of Perth in 1618. In 1619 the Privy Council of Scotland wrote to King James to defend Hay's interest in glass and iron manufacture in Scotland, arguing that Scottish glass should be sold in England without custom duties.Melros Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 337-8, 342-3. On 9 July 1622, he was appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal. On 19 July 1625, the lands of the Earldom of Orkney were transferred to him. On 7 May 1625, he was at the funeral of James VI and I in London, and was sworn in as a member of the Scottish Privy Council of Charles I. He was created Viscount of Dupplin and Lord Hay of Kinfauns on 4 May 1627. In September 1629 he was a collector of tax in Scotland. He discovered that Marie Stewart, \\"My Lady Marre\\", had obtained a chest containing important documents concerning taxes which had been kept by the late Archibald Primrose, clerk of taxations. She made some difficulties about handing over the documents, and was away from Edinburgh in the north of Scotland.HMC Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), p. 171. On 25 May 1633, he was created the Earl of Kinnoull on the occasion of the King Charles' coronation in Scotland. He resisted the king's regulations for lords of session (1626), and upheld precedency over archbishop of St Andrews. In 1626, he began to suffer from old age. It was noted that he was absent from the Council in July 1626 as he was suffering from \\"the pain of the gute\\" very severely. Two years later his \\"known infirmitie and seekenesse\\" was noted. He died of apoplexy in London and was buried in St. Constantine's Church in Kinnoull, where a monument was erected in his honour. Marriage He married Margaret, daughter of Sir James Halyburton of Pitcur manor, Kettins parish, on 15 November 1595.

The proposed location was north of Gastown on the central waterfront on what was then a parking lot and the site of a helicopter landing pad. The proposed stadium would have housed the Vancouver Whitecaps FC men and women's clubs. Proposal The $70-million stadium would have had an initial capacity of 20,000, which would be potentially expandable to 30,000 seats. In addition to Vancouver Whitecaps FC matches, the stadium was intended host international soccer matches, rugby union matches and tournaments, tennis and beach volleyball tournaments, and open-air musical events and concerts such as the Vancouver International Jazz Festival and the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. The stadium would have had close access to many modes of public transportation, including SkyTrain, SeaBus, West Coast Express, and buses. Controversy Although Vancouver public support for the stadium was high (a Mustel survey found that 71% of Vancouver residents supported the project), the proposal drew protests from several groups including the Gastown Neighbourhood Coalition. Local architects Arthur Erickson and Bing Thom also urged caution, saying that piecemeal development of some of Vancouver's last undeveloped waterfront should be avoided. They argued that the stadium would deny waterfront access and would negatively affect the historical theme of the Gastown area. The architects urged city hall to delay approval until a comprehensive plan had been submitted.Gerry Bellett, Architects join anti-stadium camp, Vancouver Sun, May 25, 2006 Independent architecture firm Hotson Bakker, which was hired by the city of Vancouver, concluded that the stadium plans as proposed were unworkable. They reported that the development did not fit with the Gastown district and did not take future residential developments into account. They also stressed the need for a comprehensive waterfront plan. History On July 11, 2006, Vancouver's city council gave unanimous approval to continue the planning process,Peter Kennedy, Whitecaps stadium given planning go-ahead, GlobeAndMail.com, July 12, 2006 provided that certain critical problems were addressed. Specific issues included the lack of roads for spectator and emergency access, and the stadium's location above railroad tracks. The project would be reviewed quarterly by city planners until the stadium's construction is approved; the developers had two years to accomplish this. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site. On February 1, 2007, Vancouver City Council unanimously endorsed a city staff report which identified a process to potentially resolve the proposed Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium's five key requirements set out by City Council. In addition, the staff report outlined a procedure to integrate the stadium with the Waterfront Hub Study. In July 2007, the City of Vancouver noted that \\"The Whitecaps and the VPA are now considering an alternative siting which addresses the technical constraints facing the SeaBus terminal site. This would involve some of the VPA-owned land between the SeaBus terminal and Crab Park (see figure below) and would enable the SeaBus to remain in place. This area is anticipated for mixed use development by the Central Waterfront Port Lands Policy Statement (1994) and any proposal would need to be considered in that context.\\" They further added \\"The Whitecaps and VPA are currently investigating whether this site could meet their needs and aspirations. If the Whitecaps and VPA decide to pursue the development of the stadium in this location, they will need to develop a proposal and submit it to City staff for evaluation and consultation with the public and interested parties.\\" Initial plans were targeting completion for Summer 2009, though this has been pushed back many times. On March 18, 2009 Major League Soccer (MLS) announced an expansion franchise to the city to begin play in 2011. The team stated intentions to play at least the first season, and possibly up to five seasons, at BC Place Stadium. In 2011, Bob Lenarduzzi confirmed that the team was committed to BC Place, and that plans for the Waterfront Stadium were put on hold.

This page contains terms starting with G ‚Äì L. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. G * Gifted: (intellectual giftedness) An intellectual ability significantly higher than average. Gifted children develop asynchronously; their minds are often ahead of their physical growth, and specific cognitive and emotional functions often are at different stages of development within a single person. Gifted individuals form a heterogeneous group. Because gifted children are intellectually ahead of most of their age peers in at least one major subject area, they frequently require gifted education programs to reach their potential and avoid boredom. Gifted individuals experience the world differently and more intensely, resulting in unique social and emotional issues. The concept of giftedness has historically been rife with controversy, some even denying that this group exists. * Gifted education: is a broad term for special practices, procedures and theories used in the education of children who have been identified as gifted or talented. Youths are usually identified as gifted by placing highly on certain standardized tests. :Advocates of gifted education argue that gifted and/or talented youth are so perceptually and intellectually above the mean, it is appropriate to pace their lessons more aggressively, track them into honors, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate courses, or otherwise provide educational enrichment. * Gymnasia and Realgymnasia: (singular: Gymnasium) and Realgymnasia were the classical higher or secondary schools of Germany from the sixteenth century to the twentieth century. Students were admitted at 9 or 10 years of age and were required to have a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic. H * Habituation: An example of non-associative learning in which there is a progressive diminution of behavioral response probability with repetition of a stimulus. It is another form of integration. * heutagogy: The study of self-determined learning. * Hidden curriculum: Draws attention to the idea that schools do more than simply transmit knowledge, as laid down in the official curricula. It is often used to criticize the social implications, political underpinnings, and cultural outcomes of modern educative activities. While early examinations were concerned with identifying the anti-democratic nature of schooling, later studies have taken various tones, including those concerned with socialism, capitalism, and anarchism in education. The University of Cambridge is an institute of higher learning. * Higher education: Education provided by universities and other institutions that award academic degrees, such as community colleges, and liberal arts colleges. :Higher education includes both the teaching and the research activities of universities, and within the realm of teaching, it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as tertiary education) and the graduate (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as quaternary education or graduate school). Higher education differs from other forms of post-secondary education such as vocational education. However, most professional education is included within higher education, and many postgraduate qualifications are strongly vocationally or professionally oriented, for example in disciplines such as law and medicine. * History of ideas: A field of research in history and in related fields dealing with the expression, preservation, and change of human ideas over time. Scholars often consider the history of ideas a sister discipline to, or a particular approach within, intellectual history. Work in the history of ideas usually involves close research in the history of philosophy and the history of literature. * Homeschooling: (also home education or home school) An educational alternative in which children are educated at home and in the community, in contrast to a compulsory education which takes place in an institution such as a publicly run or privately run school. Home education methods are similar to those widely used before the popularization of compulsory education in the 19th century. Before this time, the majority of education worldwide was provided at home by family and community members, with only the privileged attending privately run schools or employing tutors, the only available alternatives at the time. I * Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): a U.S. federal law on Special Education * Individualized instruction: A method of instruction in which content, instructional materials, instructional media, and pace of learning are based upon the abilities and interests of each individual learner. * Inquiry education: (sometimes known as the inquiry method) A student-centered method of education focused on asking questions. Students are encouraged to ask questions which are meaningful to them, and which do not necessarily have easy answers; teachers are encouraged to avoid speaking at all when this is possible, and in any case to avoid giving answers in favor of asking more questions. * Instructional capital: A term used in educational administration after the 1960s, to reflect capital resulting from investment in producing learning materials. * Instructional design: (also known as instructional systems design) The analysis of learning needs and systematic development of instruction. Instructional designers often use instructional technology as a method for developing instruction. Instructional design models typically specify a method, that if followed will facilitate the transfer of knowledge, skills and attitude to the recipient or acquirer of the instruction. * Instructional Leadership: Actions or behaviors exhibited by an individual or group in the field of education that are characterized by knowledge and skill in the area of curriculum and instructional methodology, the provision of resources so that the school‚Äôs mission can be met, skilled communication in one-on-one, small-group and large-group settings, and the establishment of a clear and articulated vision for the educational institution.Smith, W.F. & Andrews R.L. (1989). Instructional Leadership: How Principals Make a Difference. Alexandria, VA: ASCD. This vision, and decision making based on this vision are ideally characterized by a collaborative process and are inclusive of multiple stakeholders.Baron, D.(2008, February). Consensus Building: A Key to School Transformation. Principal Leadership. Instructional leaders also promote collegiality and leadership behavior amongst other members of the institution.Hoerr, T.R. (2007, December)What is Instructional Leadership? Educational Leadership * Instructional scaffolding: The provision of sufficient supports to promote learning when concepts and skills are being first introduced to students. * Instructional technology: Born as a military response to the problems of a labor shortage during WWII in the United States. There was a definitive need to fill the factories with skilled labor. Instructional technology provided a methodology for training in a systematic and efficient manner. * Instructional theory: A discipline that focuses on how to structure material for promoting the education of humans, particularly youth. Originating in the United States in the late 1970s, instructional theory is typically divided into two categories: the cognitive and behaviorist schools of thought. Instructional theory was spawned off the 1956 work of Benjamin Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, and the results of his Taxonomy of Education Objectives ‚Äî one of the first modern codifications of the learning process. :One of the first instructional theorists was Robert M. Gagne, who in 1965 published Conditions of Learning for the Florida State University's Department of Educational Research. Renowned psychologist B. F. Skinner's theories of behavior were highly influential on instructional theorists because their hypotheses can be tested fairly easily with the scientific process. A concept map * Integrative learning: A learning theory describing a movement toward integrated lessons helping students make connections across curricula. This higher education concept is distinct from the elementary and high school \\"integrated curriculum\\" movement. * Intelligence (trait): The mental capacity to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend ideas and language, and learn. Although nonscientists generally regard the concept of intelligence as having much broader scope, in psychology, the study of intelligence generally regards this trait as distinct from creativity, personality, character, or wisdom. * International education: The practice and/or study of international cooperation and aid among countries, including the exchange of students, teachers, and researchers between countries. International education is connected to comparative education. * Intrinsic motivation: Evident when people engage in an activity for its own sake, without some obvious external incentive present. A hobby is a typical example. * Invigilator: Someone who ensures the smooth running of exams. An invigilator is responsible for ensuring that the Awarding Body's regulations are complied with; that exams start and finish at the correct time; that exam papers are secure whilst in their care; that attendance and seating plans are recorded; and that no cheating takes place. The invigilator will also deal with any problems that arise during an exam, including emergency evacuations, and ensure that no unauthorised materials are present, including mobile phones. J * Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation: A coalition of major professional associations formed in 1975 to help improve the quality of evaluation. The Joint Committee published three sets of standards for evaluations. The Personnel Evaluation Standards was published in 1988, The Program Evaluation Standards (2nd edition) was published in 1994, and The Student Evaluations Standards was published in 2003. K A kindergarten in Afghanistan. * Kindergarten: (German for garden for children) A name used in many parts of the world for the first stages of a child's classroom education. In some parts kindergarten is part of the formal school system; in others it may refer to pre-school or daycare. * Kinesthetic learning: A teaching and learning style in which learning takes place by the student actually carrying out a physical activity, rather than listening to a lecture or merely watching a demonstration. Building dioramas, physical models or participating in role- playing or historical reenactment are some examples. Other examples include the kindergarten practice of having children perform various motions from left to right in preparation for reading education. * Knowledge: Information of which someone is aware. Knowledge is also used to mean the confident understanding of a subject, potentially with the ability to use it for a specific purpose. :The unreliability of memory limits the certainty of knowledge about the past, while unpredictability of events yet to occur limits the certainty of knowledge about the future. Epistemology is the philosophical study of the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge. * Knowledge Management: (or KM) A term applied to techniques used for the systematic collection, transfer, security and management of information within organisations, along with systems designed to help make best use of that knowledge. In particular it refers to tools and techniques designed to preserve the availability of information held by key individuals and facilitate decision making and reducing risk. * Knowledge representation: (KR) Most commonly used to refer to representations intended for processing by modern computers, and particularly for representations consisting of explicit objects. * Knowledge transfer: In the fields of Organizational development and organizational learning, is the practical problem of getting a packet of knowledge from one part of the organization to another (or all other) parts of the organization. It is considered to be more than just a communications problem. * Knowledge visualization: A sub discipline of Information Design and Instructional Message Design (pedagogy; didactics, pedagogical Psychology). Knowledge Visualization aims to improve the transfer of knowledge by using computer and non-computer based visuals complementary. Examples of such visual formats are photographs, information graphics, sketches, diagrams, images, mind maps, objects, interactive visualizations, dynamic visuals (animations), information visualization applications, imaginary visualizations, stories. L * Language education: The teaching and learning of a language or languages, usually as foreign languages. * Law (principle): Refers to universal principles that describe the fundamental nature of something, to universal properties and relationships between things, or to descriptions that purport to explain these principles and relationships. * Learning: The process of acquiring knowledge, skills, attitudes, or values, through study, experience, or teaching, that causes a change of behavior that is persistent, measurable, and specified or allows an individual to formulate a new mental construct or revise a prior mental construct (conceptual knowledge such as attitudes or values). It is a process that depends on experience and leads to long-term changes in behavior potential. * Learning by teaching (LdL): In professional education (in German \\"Lernen durch Lehren\\", therefore LdL) designates a method which allows pupils and students to prepare and teach lessons or parts of lessons. Learning by teaching should not be confused with presentations or lectures by students, as students do not only convey a certain content, but choose their own methodological and didactical approach in teaching their classmates a certain area of the respective subject. * Learning disability: In the United States, the term learning disability is used to refer to socio- biological conditions that affect a persons communicative capacities and potential to learn. The term includes conditions such as perceptual disability, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, autism, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. In the United Kingdom, the term learning disability is used more generally to refer to developmental disability and intellectual disability. * Learning outcome: The term may refer to course aims (intended learning outcomes) or may be roughly synonymous with educational objectives (observed learning outcomes). Usage varies between organisations. * Lecture: An oral presentation intended to teach people about a particular subject, for example by a university or college teacher. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture. Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content. * Legal education: The education of individuals who intend to become legal professionals (attorneys and judges) or those who simply intend to use their law degree to some end, either related to law (such as politics or academic) or unrelated (such as business entrepreneurship). :This entry primarily discusses some of the general attributes of legal education in the United States for those who intend to use their degree in order to become legal professionals. * Lesson plan: A teacher's detailed description of the course of instruction for an individual lesson. While there is no one way to construct a correct lesson plan, most lesson plans contain similar elements. The seven liberal arts * Liberal arts: Studies that are intended to provide general knowledge and intellectual skills, rather than more specialized occupational or professional skills. :The scope of the liberal arts has changed with society. It once emphasised the education of elites in the classics; but, with the rise of science and humanities during the Age of Enlightenment, the scope and meaning of \\"liberal arts\\" expanded to include them. Still excluded from the liberal arts are topics that are specific to particular occupations, such as agriculture, business, dentistry, engineering, medicine, pedagogy (school-teaching), and pharmacy. * List group label strategy: a prereading strategy designed to help students make connections to prior knowledge. * Literacy: The ability to read, write, speak, and listen. In modern context, the word means reading and writing in a level adequate for written communication and generally a level that enables one to successfully function at certain levels of a society.

It is mainly green and has orange on its upper chest and head. It is 13 cm (5 inches) long and is the smallest parrot on mainland Africa. In captivity, it is uncommon and difficult to breed.  Description  upright The Lilian's lovebird is 13 cm (5 inches) long and is mainly green with white eyerings. It has orange on its head, neck and upper chest and has a green rump. Male and female are identical in external appearance. The Lilian's lovebird is often mistaken for the slightly larger Fischer's lovebird, which has an olive-green hood and a blue rump. It is also broadly similar to the Peach-faced lovebird, which has more clearly demarcated orange colouration, and lacks a white eyering,. Food and feeding Lilian's lovebird feeds on grass seeds, millet, wild rice, flowers, and the seeds and fruit of other species.h Breeding The Breeding season for Lilian's lovebirds is from January to March and in June and July. They make a roofed nest in tree crevices. In captivity the clutch consists of three to eight white eggs, which are incubated for about 22 days, and the chicks leave the nest after about 44 days from hatching. Distribution and habitat Lilian's lovebird is endemic to Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In 2004 its numbers in the wild were estimated to be less than 20,000 individuals. It currently inhabits Liwonde National Park (LNP) and a few cluster groups occur in the surrounding forests outside LNP. Its distribution is rapidly becoming restricted to LNP because their feeding and breeding habitats are being exploited over for agricultural purposes. The extent of habitat loss outside LNP has not been determined scientifically although remaining habitat outside the LNP are fragmented Miombo Forest Reserves. Threats Liwonde National Park is located in the southern region of Malawi, which has the highest human population density in the country approximating 100-115 inhabitants per km¬≤ (FAO, 1997). LNP is greatly impacted by population growth and agricultural activities than any other national park in the country. Recently, cases of Lilian's lovebird poisoning have intensified although it is not known why poachers are poisoning the birds. Lilian's lovebird researchers assume poachers mean to poison larger mammals and lovebirds fall victims. Life Span and Health issues Life span for Lilian lovebirds is 10-12 years. The major health concern for these species is loneliness. These birds need mate for life. Similarities mitochondrial gene for Lilian lovebird aligns with Agapornis roseicollis (Rosy-faced lovebirds) Aviculture Lilian's lovebird is a difficult species to rear in captivity. Many breeders worldwide struggle to breed the species. ReferencesExternal links * Lilian's lovebird - Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.

Bus drivers typically drive their vehicles between bus stations or stops. Bus drivers often drop off and pick up passengers on a predetermined route schedule. In British English a different term, coach driver (or coach captain), is used for drivers on privately booked long-distance routes, tours and school trips. There are various types of bus drivers, including transit drivers, school bus drivers and tour bus drivers. Bus drivers may work for a city, public (state and national/federal) governments, school boards, and private enterprises, such as charter companies which run tour buses. Coach captains in Australia are frequently freelance sub-contractors who work for various bus and coach companies. Bus drivers also need to possess social skills for interacting with their passengers, which is a daily occurrence.  By country = Australia  In Australia, bus and coach drivers need a Drivers Licence (issued in an Australian state or territory) for the class of vehicle they drive. Additionally, they are required to possess a driver authorisation to drive a bus (also issued by the state or territory). This has different names in different states, for example, Driver Authorisation in Queensland, Driver Accreditation in Victoria, General Driver Authorisation in New South Wales, Public Passenger Vehicle Ancillary Certificate in Tasmania and so on. This authorisation entails a regular review of driving history, criminal history, and medical assessment for fitness to drive. In 2012, Australia had a fleet of 90,599 buses and collectively travelled about 2.0 billion km. The average age of the national fleet is 11.0 years. In 2011, there were 40,900 bus and coach drivers employed in the industry. They work an average of 41.7 hours/week and the average age is 54 years. The main employing industries are Transport, Postal and Warehousing 87.4%, and the remainder include Health Care and Social Assistance 4%, Education and Training 3.1%, and Accommodation and Food Services 2.7%.  New Zealand  Bus and coach drivers require either a class 2 or class 4 heavy vehicle licence corresponding to the weight and number of axles of their vehicle. As of October 1, 2017, drivers are not required to hold a P (passenger) endorsement to take fare-paying passengers. The change in legislation was seen by passenger service companies as the government acquiescing to Uber drivers ignoring NZ Transport Agency's requirements despite ramping up infringement notices on non-compliant drivers in the last few months of P endorsement requirements. Drivers of school buses for special needs children must comply with SESTA requirements.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom drivers must have passed the Passenger Carrying Vehicle (PCV) practical driving and theory test. PCV drivers also have to possess a Certificate of Professional Competence card which requires extra training to be taken. Service bus drivers in the UK are not subject to the working hours restrictions devised by the European Union if their journeys do not exceed 30 miles radius, but are governed by less stringent UK Drivers' Hours Regulations. For example, a service bus driver may drive for 5.5 hours without a break in the UK. People with certain medical conditions are excluded from becoming bus drivers. Some of these conditions include Migraine (if it affects vision), Alcoholism and Epilepsy. Traditionally, before the introduction of one-man buses on many city routes, the bus driver had no contact with the passengers, the tickets being sold by a bus conductor. Now, drivers have the additional responsibility of selling tickets, keeping to the timetable and providing customer service. Because of the additional workload many buses are fitted with closed-circuit television in an attempt to protect drivers from an increasing number of attacks which has resulted in a recruitment crisis in some British cities.  United States  , there are approximately 687,200 U.S. employed bus drivers. One of the most common jobs in the United States for a bus driver is to work for a public school, transporting students aboard a school bus to and from the school building. As of 2004, 71% of bus drivers in the U.S. were employed by schools. In other countries, school transport is often provided by the same companies that run other bus services in the area, so school bus driver is not a separate position. In the United States, finding a position as a bus driver usually requires that the individual possess a commercial driver's license (CDL) and specialized training for the vehicle. Various other educational and vocational training may be required, but this varies from place to place.

More specifically, the conjecture claims that on a compact contact manifold, its Reeb vector field should carry at least one periodic orbit. By definition, a level set of contact type admits a contact form obtained by contracting the Hamiltonian vector field into the symplectic form. In this case, the Hamiltonian flow is a Reeb vector field on that level set. It is a fact that any contact manifold (M,Œ±) can be embedded into a canonical symplectic manifold, called the symplectization of M, such that M is a contact type level set (of a canonically defined Hamiltonian) and the Reeb vector field is a Hamiltonian flow. That is, any contact manifold can be made to satisfy the requirements of the Weinstein conjecture. Since, as is trivial to show, any orbit of a Hamiltonian flow is contained in a level set, the Weinstein conjecture is a statement about contact manifolds. It has been known that any contact form is isotopic to a form that admits a closed Reeb orbit; for example, for any contact manifold there is a compatible open book decomposition, whose binding is a closed Reeb orbit. This is not enough to prove the Weinstein conjecture, though, because the Weinstein conjecture states that every contact form admits a closed Reeb orbit, while an open book determines a closed Reeb orbit for a form which is only isotopic to the given form. The conjecture was formulated in 1978 by Alan Weinstein. In several cases, the existence of a periodic orbit was known. For instance, Rabinowitz showed that on star-shaped level sets of a Hamiltonian function on a symplectic manifold, there were always periodic orbits (Weinstein independently proved the special case of convex level sets). Weinstein observed that the hypotheses of several such existence theorems could be subsumed in the condition that the level set be of contact type. (Weinstein's original conjecture included the condition that the first de Rham cohomology group of the level set is trivial; this hypothesis turned out to be unnecessary). The Weinstein conjecture was first proved for contact hypersurfaces in \\\\mathbb R^{2n} in 1986 by , then extended to cotangent bundles by Hofer‚ÄìViterbo and to wider classes of aspherical manifolds by Floer‚ÄìHofer‚ÄìViterbo. The presence of holomorphic spheres was used by Hofer‚ÄìViterbo. All these cases dealt with the situation where the contact manifold is a contact submanifold of a symplectic manifold. A new approach without this assumption was discovered in dimension 3 by Hofer and is at the origin of contact homology. The Weinstein conjecture has now been proven for all closed 3-dimensional manifolds by Clifford Taubes. The proof uses a variant of Seiberg‚ÄìWitten Floer homology and pursues a strategy analogous to Taubes' proof that the Seiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants are equivalent on a symplectic four-manifold. In particular, the proof provides a shortcut to the closely related program of proving the Weinstein conjecture by showing that the embedded contact homology of any contact three-manifold is nontrivial.

She was born in Beijing and died in Shanghai. She was the eldest daughter of Wu Chien-ch'uan, the best known teacher of Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan. Her older brothers were Wu Kung-i and Wu Kung-tsao. Biography Wu Ying-hua began studying t'ai chi ch'uan at age nine, and by age seventeen, she was a full-time teacher in her father's school. In 1921, she was invited to teach t'ai chi ch'uan in Shanghai. In 1928, her father followed her to Shanghai and she became his teaching assistant. In 1930, she married Ma Yueh- liang who was Wu Chien-ch'uan's senior disciple. In 1935, Wu Chien-ch'uan founded the Chien-ch'uan Tai Chi Chuan Association (ÈëëÊ≥âÂ§™Ê•µÊã≥Á§æ) in Shanghai. Wu Chien-ch'uan died in 1942. After the Cultural Revolution, at about 1980, it became possible to teach t'ai chi ch'uan publicly in China. About this time her brother Wu Kung-tsao was released from prison and moved to Hong Kong. Wu Ying-hua and Ma Yueh-liang, remaining in mainland China, created a simplified Wu t'ai chi ch'uan form and were again able to have public meetings of the Chien-ch'uan Tai Chi Chuan Association. They taught a large number of students in Shanghai and in their travels to New Zealand, Germany and elsewhere. Together with Ma Yueh-liang, Wu Ying-hua published several books on Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan. The books ‚ÄúWu style Tai Chi Chuan: Forms, Concepts and Applications of the Original Style,‚Äù ‚ÄúWu Simplified Tai Chi Chuan,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWu style Tai Chi K'uai (Fast) Chuan or Wu Style Tai Chi Fast Form‚Äù have been collected in a single volume in China. They also co-authored a Wu style sword book. Wu Ying-hua was the senior instructor of the Wu family from 1983 until she died in 1996.

He was a professor in Duisburg, Utrecht, and Leiden, where he held positions in mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and astronomy. He is credited with the invention of the first capacitor in 1746: the Leyden jar. He performed pioneering work on the buckling of compressed struts. Musschenbroek was also one of the first scientists (1729) to provide detailed descriptions of testing machines for tension, compression, and flexure testing. An early example of a problem in dynamic plasticity was described in the 1739 paper (in the form of the penetration of butter by a wooden stick subjected to impact by a wooden sphere). Early life and studies Pieter van Musschenbroek was born on 14 March 1692 in Leiden, Holland, Dutch Republic. His father was Johannes van Musschenbroek and his mother was Margaretha van Straaten. The Van Musschenbroeks, originally from Flanders, had lived in the city of Leiden since circa 1600. His father was an instrument maker, who made scientific instruments such as air pumps, microscopes, and telescopes. Van Musschenbroek attended Latin school until 1708, where he studied Greek, Latin, French, English, High German, Italian, and Spanish. He studied medicine at Leiden University and received his doctorate in 1715. He also attended lectures by John Theophilus Desaguliers and Isaac Newton in London. He finished his study in philosophy in 1719. Musschenbroek belonged to the tradition of Dutch thinkers who popularised the ontological argument of God's design.David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers. God and Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science. University of California Press. p. 263 He is author of Oratio de sapientia divina (Prayer of Divine Wisdom. 1744). Academic career=Duisburg In 1719, he became professor of mathematics and philosophy at the University of Duisburg. In 1721, he also became professor of medicine. Utrecht In 1723, he left his posts in Duisburg and became professor at the University of Utrecht. In 1726 he also became professor in astronomy.van der Aa on dbnl. Musschenbroek's Elementa Physica (1726) played an important part in the transmission of Isaac Newton's ideas in physics to Europe. In November 1734 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.http://www.mordaunt.me.uk/pdf/Royal%20Society.pdf Leiden An early 20th-century illustration of a Leyden jar. In 1739, he returned to Leiden, where he succeeded Jacobus Wittichius as professor. Already during his studies at Leiden University Van Musschenbroek became interested in electrostatics. At that time, transient electrical energy could be generated by friction machines but there was no way to store it. Musschenbroek and his student Andreas Cunaeus discovered that the energy could be stored, in work that also involved Jean-Nicolas-S√©bastien Allamand as collaborator. The apparatus was a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed; and the stored energy could be released only by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally a hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. Van Musschenbroek communicated this discovery to Ren√© R√©aumur in January 1746, and it was Abb√© Nollet, the translator of Musschenbroek's letter from Latin, who named the invention the 'Leyden jar'.Maver, William Jr.: \\"Electricity, its History and Progress\\", The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol. X, pp. 172ff. (1918). New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp. Soon afterwards, it transpired that a German scientist, Ewald von Kleist, had independently constructed a similar device in late 1745, shortly before Musschenbroek.Houston, E. J.: Electricity in Every-day Life, vol. I, p. 72f; P. F. Collier & Son, New York 1905. URL. Retrieved 17 February 2010. In 1754, he became an honorary professor at the Imperial Academy of Science in Saint Petersburg. He was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1747.

The stones are considered to be part of the funnelbeaker culture (3500 - 2800 B.C.). The gravesite was granted protected cultural monument status in 1923.  Geographical Location  The Sieben Steinh√§user are located roughly in the middle of the Bergen-Hohne Training Area which lies between Bad Fallingbostel to the northwest and Bergen to the east. The dolmens are found at a height of 56 and . A stream, the Hohe Bach (\\"High Brook\\") which is a northeastern tributary of the River Mei√üe in the catchment area of the Aller, flows past the stones in a north-south direction.  Accessibility  The only public access route to the dolmens begins at a barrier in Ostenholz, about southeast of the Walsrode autobahn interchange. The access road runs for several kilometres through the out-of-bounds area of the military training area. It is regularly cleared of any spent ammunition from the ranges. The site is only accessible on days when no exercises are taking place i.e. at weekends and on public holidays between 8 am and 6 pm.  History  Plan of the site The Sieben Steinh√§user gravesite was established during the third millennium BC during the neolithic funnelbeaker period by the first settled farmers.Various dates have been posited for the construction of the site. Heinz Schirnig gives a date of \\"around 2800 B. C.\\" The large gravesite, Grave D, shows similarities to French gravesites, the other four are like those of the Elbe-Weser Triangle. Although they are traditionally called the Sieben Steinh√§usern (\\"seven stone houses\\") there are actually only five graves. Because an old illustration from 1744 still shows only five graves, it is assumed today, that the number seven is being used in the figurative sense for a larger number, as in the German expression sieben Sachen (\\"seven things\\") which means 'everything'. The first written record of the graves was made in 1720 by an academic.Gro√üsteingr√§ber Sieben Steinh√§user at www.steinzeugen.de. Retrieved 13 Jan 2014. On 24 July, 1835 the gravesite was placed under conservation protection by the Amtsvogtei of Fallingbostel. The regional author, August Freudenthal, contributed to their fame in the 19th century. Even then it was a popular tourist destination.Bergen: Die Sieben Steinh√§user at www.lueneburger-heide.de. Retrieved 13 Jan 2014.  Description of the graves  The burial chambers are all rectangular and aligned in a northeast- southwest direction. Their capstones are not of bay construction, but almost always supported by three or four points of contact. The largest of the dolmens has a capstone measuring 16 by 14 feet (c. 5 m by 4¬º m) and is supported by seven upright support stones. All the graves were originally covered with earth, so that they would looked like earth mounds or tumuli. Over the course of time the earth was eroded by wind and weather, so that the stones became visible again. Four graves were excavated and restored between 1924 and 1937. In 1958, the graves were enclosed by protective earthen walls several metres high. They protect the gravesites from shell damage, because the site is located in the middle of a live firing range. The dolmens have Sprockhoff Numbers 806 to 810.http://www.steinzeugen.de/sz_falling.htm Steinzeugen.de Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab a-2.jpgGrave A Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab b-3.jpgGrave B Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab c 2-2.jpgGrave C Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab d-2.jpgGrave D Image:Siebensteinhaeuser grab e-2.jpgGrave E  Grave A  Grave A comprises four supporting stones along the sides and another stone at each end. On the supporting stones are three capstones, the middle one of which is considerably narrower and has been broken. The inside dimensions of the chamber are 6.5 x 2 m. The entrance is in the middle of the southeastern side, but only the pair of supporting pillars are left.  Grave B  Interior of Grave B Grave B is also composed of four supporting stones along the sides, but unlike Grave A, there are also four capstones. One is very narrow and placed between them like a lintel (Jochstein). The internal size of the chamber is 7.0 x 2.2 m. Of the entrance in the middle, only the southern pillar remains.  Grave C  The relatively short chamber of Grave C consists of three supporting stones on the southeast and four on the northwest side as well as two end stones and three capstones. Before restoration only the northeastern three-point support, the centre of the three supporting stones on the southeast side and the southwestern end stone were found in situ. Two capstones probably caved in under their own weight when their supports were dislodged. The internal dimensions of the chamber are 5 x 2 m. The outside entrance appears to have been located between the first and centre support stones to the south of the southeastern side of the chamber. In December 2013, the chamber collapsed, probably due to soil erosion, but there are plans to rebuild it.Siebensteinhaus ist zusammengebrochen at www.wz- net.de. Retrieved 13 Jan 2014.Steingrab wird wieder aufgebaut at www.wz- net.de. Retrieved 13 Jan 2014.  Grave D with enclosure  Grave D is the most impressive in the entire group. The support stones of the short, almost square burial chamber consist of a slab on the southwest side and two on the other side. The chamber is covered by a mighty stone slab which measures 4.6 x 4.2 m and is half a metre thick. The inside dimensions of the stocky chamber are roughly 4 x 3 m. The entrance is located in the centre of the southeastern side, its support stones are original whilst the capstone has been restored. A rectangular enclosure belongs to this gravesite, so it appears that we are dealing with a preserved long barrow whose enclosure has been restored. It is about 4 m wide und 14 m long, apart from an abrupt gap to the southwest. Because there are no traces of stone pillars having been removed, it is suspected that this could have been used to lay out 3 to 4 more sites for planned graves during the Neolithic era.  Grave E  The sides of grave E, like grave A, comprise four supporters each, on which lie three capstones. The support stone on the southwestern end was restored. From the fact that two of the chambers capstones (the southwestern and the centre one) have been found in halves, it is not difficult to surmise that the stone blocks were artificially split in prehistoric times. In carrying out the restoration work the two easily movable capstones were replaced. The chamber has internal measurements of 5.6 x 2 m. Only the two external pillars are left from the entrance in the middle of the southeastern side.  The legend of the Sieben Steinh√§user  According to a legend that is recounted by many in the Heidmark area, the largest stone was fired at the Sieben Steinh√§user by the giant of Borg from a catapult at Elferdingen which was located near the \\"Orskarrn\\". The two largest stone pillars of the largest grave were placed by the giant in the pocket of his coat. The giant went to the stone graves via Fallingbostel. There the area was very sandy and the giant's shoes soon filled with sand. He shook himself out near Fallingbostel and that's how the Tutberg and Weinberg hills appeared.Hans Stuhlmacher: Die Heidmark.

Over the course of his career he worked for several different automobile brands, and many of his designs went into full production. He is best known for his work at Citro√´n, which he joined in 1962 and where he became Responsable de Style, head of the design department, in 1964. Biography Opron was born in Amiens in Picardy, France. His father was in the military and received several postings to locations in French Colonial Africa, so Opron grew up in places like Algeria, Mali and Abidjan. At 18 Opron contracted tuberculosis, and had to spend time in a sanatorium. He returned to France in 1952 and enrolled in the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Amiens; one year later he transferred to the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He studied architecture under Auguste Perret. Altogether Opron spent eight years studying architecture, painting, and sculpture. At age 21 he married Genevi√®ve Mercier. In the early 1950s Opron's interest in aircraft led him to take up flying, including acrobatic flying. In 1952 Opron began his professional career as a machine designer for the Compagnie Nationale des Sucreries in Ham in the Somme. In 1954 he was hired by aircraft builder Soci√©t√© Nationale de Constructions A√©ronautices du Nord. He specialised in cockpit design, and worked on the Nord Noratlas aircraft. Opron began working at Simca in 1958 at age 26. His department was eliminated in 1961, and Opron received a two-year severance payout, but with a non-compete clause that prevented him from moving to another automaker. Instead Opron went to Arthur Martin, a company that produced housewares and home appliances, where he became Director of Style. Opron returned to automotive design with Citro√´n in 1962. Over the course of his career Opron became known for balancing a collaborative, team-based approach to design with creative input from individuals. He finally retired from design work in 2001. Awards and recognition Opron was one of twenty- five designers nominated for the 1999 Car Designer of the Century competition. A celebration of his work, OPRON 50 Years of Style, was held on 11 May 2002 in Verri√®res-le-Buisson on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Opron received Car Design News' Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016. The Carlisle Import & Performance Nationals of August 14‚Äì16 2020 is scheduled to include a featured display titled: \\"Cars of Robert Opron\\". Design history=Simca Having joined Simca in 1958, his first significant project for them was designing the 1959 Simca Chambord Pr√©sidence V8 cabriolet used by French president Charles De Gaulle In 1959 Opron unveiled the futuristic Simca Fulgur concept car. This bubble-topped design was Opron's response to a challenge from the magazine Journal de Tintin to design a car for the 1980s. The magazine supplied a list of anticipated standard features that included radar obstacle detection and gyroscopic stabilisation. Opron consulted with an astrophysicist friend to help integrate these not-yet realised concepts into the car. While at Simca he sketched out a two-box hatchback that caught the attention of Fiat's designers. This sketch eventually led to the Simca 1100. Another sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace. Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to Fergus Pollock. In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the Matra Rancho by designing an MPV using Simca parts and with input from Opron. This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \\"Project P16\\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started. Citro√´n In 1962 Mme. Opron-Mercier noticed an advertisement in Le Monde saying that an \\"Important industrial group\\" was looking to hire an experienced designer. Opron responded to the ad, and was directed to report to the Quai de Javel, the home of Citro√´n. The personnel manager asked Opron to return later that day to the Bureau d'√âtudes on the Rue du Th√©√¢tre to meet with Flaminio Bertoni, Citro√´n's chief designer and originator of the 2CV and DS. When Opron arrived for the meeting with Bertoni, the older man asked to see Opron's portfolio of drawings. Opron recalled that Bertoni \\"threw them on the floor, poking them with his cane and stated that he did not think much of them.\\" Opron collected his drawings and indicated that he found Bertoni's behavior unacceptable, to which Bertoni replied \\"I do find you interesting though!\\". Opron left, vowing to never work for such a man. Three weeks later, he received a letter of appointment from Citro√´n. Opron joined Citro√´n‚Äôs Bureau d‚Äô√âtudes in 1962. For the first three months he worked in the \\"M√©thodes\\" section. Opron became Citro√´n's Responable de Style, or chief stylist, in 1964 following the death of Bertoni. Opron was tasked with developing a replacement for the 2CV, which evolved into the 1965 Citro√´n G-Mini design study. In 1965 Citro√´n launched new lines of trucks; the 350 and 600 series that earned the nickname Belph√©gor for their unique cab design. The trucks were designed by Bertoni and Opron. Opron began working on the second restyling of the Citro√´n DS as early as 1963 with Projet D29. His \\"Nouveau Visage\\" (new face) front appearing on the 1968 model year DS was a four-headlamp design with two lamps on each side under glass covers that blended with the body's lines. The inner headlamp on each side pivoted with the steering wheel, while the outer lamps were self- leveling. In 1967, having abandoned the ambitious Projet F begun by Bertoni and taken over by Opron, Citro√´n initiated a competition for a new mid-range model that pitted Opron and the Bureau d'√âtudes against Giorgetto Giugiaro and Italdesign. Both teams submitted designs for front wheel drive 3- and 5-door cars powered by flat-four engines. Opron's proposal carried the day, and his Project G eventually became the GS released in 1970. Some have claimed that Opron based the GS' shape on the Pininfarina Austin 1800 Aerodinamica Berline of 1967. Others assert that, while it may have been influenced by the Italo- English concept car, Opron's design was an independent work, and point out that Citro√´n has never acknowledged any link. Giugiaro's rejected design was taken up by Alfa Romeo and developed into the Alfasud. In 1968 Citro√´n opened a new Centre d'√âtudes at V√©lizy, France. Opron oversaw the arrangements for the move, which was completed progressively over several years. Opron refreshed the Ami 6 to create the Ami 8 of 1969. He also led the team that developed the Citro√´n M35, a two-door fastback based on the Ami 8 chassis that was powered by a single rotor Comotor engine. Production ran from 1969‚Äì1971, and although 500 M35s were planned to be built, the total number is believed to be just more than half that. The first completely new model of the Opron era, and the car he is most closely associated with, was the SM. Assigned the development name Projet S, the original goal was to produce a racing car suitable for Le Mans. Through the influence of Opron and Pierre Bercot, Citro√´n's managing director, it evolved from a racing car into a premium model in the old Grand Routier tradition. The SM team, which included Jean Giert, built a full-scale model in the Bureau d'√âtudes workshops on the Rue du Th√©√¢tre, making the SM the last model developed in this location before the last of the style department moved to their new location in V√©lizy. A design for a possible GS-based coup√© progressed to the full-scale model stage. The car was to be built by Ligier when their contract to assemble the SM expired in 1974‚Äì75 but did not go into production. The project that was Opron's personal favorite was also his last design for Citro√´n. Initially called Projet L, the result was the CX, which debuted in 1974 as the successor to the DS. When Citro√´n declared bankruptcy in 1974, the French Government stepped in and arranged a merger of Citro√´n with Peugeot. Opron left shortly after this. Renault In 1975 Opron started work at Renault after reportedly being the target of an executive search by them. For his new employers he led the redesign of the Alpine A310, a project that stylist Peter Stevens was also involved in. The original 4-cylinder A310 was modified to accommodate the V6 PRV engine, and to address some aerodynamic deficiencies of the original shape. Opron developed a design for an ultra-compact city car called the V√©hicule Bas de Gamme (VBG), or Entry Level Vehicle. He was also involved in the Vesta II concept car of 1987, along with designer Gaston Juchet. Opron's designs at Renault included the Renault Fuego sports coup√© of 1980, as well as the Renault 9 and 11, with the 9 sedan released in 1981 and the 11 hatchback in 1983. Opron worked with AMC's Dick Teague to adapt the 9 and 11 models to the American market, where they were sold as the Alliance and Encore respectively. Opron's tenure at Renault was marked by extensive collaborations with other well-known designers and carrosserie. Marcello Gandini influenced the shape of the 25 of 1983, and produced the shape for the Super Cinq in 1984. An association with Giugiaro and Italdesign resulted in the Renault Gabbiano of 1983, and later the Renault 21 of 1986 and Renault 19 of 1988. In May 1977 Opron sent a letter to director Fran√ßois Zanotti, director of Renault‚Äôs commercial division, with a proposal for a new line of commercial trucks, and included two sketches by designer Guy Greffier. Zanotti approved further development, and Greffier refined his original sketches. As the project progressed, Opron invited Gandini to join the design effort. The end result was the Renault AE Magnum truck line released in 1990, when it also won \\"European Truck of the Year\\". Opron wanted to establish a centre of advanced styling in the United States. He spent time in the States working to that end, but it did not materialise. When he returned to Europe he arrived to changes in the leadership of Renault. Opron left Renault in 1985. Fiat After Renault Opron moved to Centro Stile at Fiat, where he was put in charge of advanced studies. He is credited with creating the earliest sketches for a design project called the ES 30, for Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litres. Opron's early concept, which won out against a competing proposal from Giugiaro, was fully developed by Antonio Castellana. The prototype was completed in just nineteen months ‚Äì quickly enough to appear at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show. This highly controversial design went into limited production as the Alfa Romeo SZ coup√© and the later RZ convertible, where the \\"Z\\"refers to coachbuilder Zagato. The model was also given the nickname \\"Il Mostro\\" (the monster) for its unusual appearance. In 1992 Opron left Fiat at sixty years of age, having reached mandatory retirement age. Independent consultant From 1991 to 2000 he operated his own independent design consultancy in Verri√®res-le-Buisson in south Paris (Essonne). One of Opron's clients was Ligier, who had become a manufacturer of \\"voitures sans permis\\" or \\"voiturettes\\", a class of microcar in France that may be driven without an operator's license. For Ligier Opron produced the original Du√©, which debuted at the 1998 Paris Motor Show. The Ligier Dragonfly shown at the 2000 Geneva Motor Show was also an Opron design. Opron also consulted for Piaggio.

Usually - but not necessarily - the mentor/prot√©g√© pair will be of the same sex. :The roots of the practice are lost in antiquity. The word itself was inspired by the character of Mentor in Homer's Odyssey. Though the actual Mentor in the story is a somewhat ineffective old man, the goddess Athena takes on his appearance in order to guide young Telemachus in his time of difficulty. :Historically significant systems of mentorship include apprenticing under the medieval guild system, and the discipleship system practiced by both Rabbinical Judaism and the Christian church. University (1350s). * Medieval university: The first European medieval institutions generally considered to be universities were established in Italy, France and England in the late 11th and the 12th Century for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology. These universities evolved from much older schools and monasteries, and it is difficult to define the first date at which they became true universities for teaching higher education, although the lists of studia generali for higher education in Europe held by the Vatican are a useful guide. Some other institutions such as the imperial university of Constantinople claim that they changed from schools to universities as early as the 11th Century. * Medieval university (Asia): Medieval universities did not exist in Asia in the strict sense of the phrase. However, there were important centres of learning that can be compared to the universities of Europe. Unlike the European universities, non-western institutions of higher learning were never known to issue degrees to their graduates and therefore do not meet what many hold to be the technical definition of university. This does not, however, bar their importance to the history of non-western cultures. * Meta-: In epistemology, the prefix meta- is used to mean about (its own category). For example, metadata is data about data (who has produced it, when, what format the data is in and so on). Similarly, meta-memory in psychology means an individual's intuition about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. Any subject can be said to have a meta-theory, which is the theoretical consideration of its foundations and methods. * Metacognition: Refers to thinking about cognition (memory, perception, calculation, association, etc.) itself. Metacognition can be divided into two types of knowledge: explicit, conscious, factual knowledge; and implicit, unconscious, procedural knowledge. The ability to think about thinking is unique to sapient species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience. Metacognition is practiced to attempt to regulate one's own cognition, and maximize one's potential to think, learn and process stimuli from the surroundings. Allegory of Music, by Lorenzo Lippi * Methodology: Strictly speaking is the study and knowledge of methods; but the term is frequently used pretentiously to indicate a method or a set of methods. In other words, it is the study of techniques for problem-solving and seeking answers, as opposed to the techniques themselves. * Military education and training:Process that intends to educate in combat and in situations of war. * Mind map: (or mind-map) A diagram used for linking words and ideas to a central key word or idea. It is used to visualize, classify, structure, and generate ideas, as well as an aid in study, problem solving, and decision making. * Mind uploading The futurist high technology to rapidly increase the speed of information exchange to neurology. A form of education that focuses on extreme time efficiency. * Motivation: The driving force behind all actions of human beings and other animals. It is an internal state that activates behavior and gives it direction. Emotion is closely related to motivation, and may be regarded as the subjectively experienced component of motivational states. * Music education: Comprises the application of education methods in teaching music. N * NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.: (NAACP LDF or simply LDF) A leading United States civil rights organization. It was founded in 1940 under the leadership of Thurgood Marshall as part of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and spun out as a separate organization in 1957. * National Educational Television: (NET) was an educational television network in the USA from 1952 until 1970 and was the predecessor of the Public Broadcasting Service. * National postgraduate representative body: Exists in many countries representing postgraduate students/researchers undertaking their doctorate (PhD) or postdoctoral research. Some have a broader remit to represent all postgraduates, including those taking Master's degrees. A few countries have no specific body but are represented by a national body representing all students, including undergraduates. In Europe many of the national organisations have come together under the federation Eurodoc. * Network of practice: Builds on the work on communities of practice by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in the early 1990s, John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid (2000) developed the concept of networks of practice (often abbreviated as NoPs). This concept refers to the overall set of various types of informal, emergent social networks that facilitate learning and knowledge sharing between individuals conducting practice-related tasks. In other words, networks of practice range from communities of practice to electronic networks of practice (often referred to as virtual or electronic communities). * Nines System: The informal name for a grading scale often used at educational institutions in English-speaking countries, particularly the United States. :The system owes its name to the fact that each of the top four letter grades in it cover a range of nine points. The minimum passing mark under it is almost always 65%, or five points higher than in the more widely used Tens System. Notes on a mind map * Normal school: An educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The term normal school is now archaic in all but a few countries. In New Zealand, for example, normal schools are affiliated with Teachers colleges. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, normal schools in the United States and Canada trained primary school teachers, while in Europe, normal schools educated primary, secondary and tertiary-level teachers. * Notetaking: The practice of writing pieces of information, often in an informal or unstructured manner. One major specific type of notetaking is the practice of writing in shorthand, which can allow large amounts of information to be put on paper very quickly. Notes are frequently written in notebooks, though any available piece of paper can suffice in many circumstances--some people are especially fond of Post-It notes, for instance. Notetaking is an important skill for students, especially at the college level. Many different forms are used to structure information and make it easier to find later. Computers, particularly tablet PCs and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are beginning to see wide use as notetaking devices. * Numeracy: A term that emerged in the United Kingdom as a contraction of \\"numerical literacy\\". In the United States, it is somewhat better known as \\"Quantitative Literacy,\\" and is familiar to math educators and intellectuals but not in the common usage. Innumeracy is the absence of numeracy. Young children learn very quickly. * Nursery school: (or preschool) A school for the education of very young children (generally five years of age and younger). These schools range from schools which seek to teach young children to schools which only provide childcare with little educational benefits. Schools which focus on education generally teach early social skills including interpersonal interaction, being a part of a group of peers, and classroom skills such as following the instructions of a teacher. Some formal education also takes place, such as early reading or language skills. Some nursery schools have adopted specialized methods of teaching, such as Montessori, High Scope, Reggio Emilia approach and various other pedagogy. O * Objective: An educational objective is a statement of a goal which successful participants are expected demonstrably to achieve before the course or unit completes. * Objectivity (philosophy): Has various meanings in philosophy, and is surely one of the most important philosophical problems, since it concerns the epistemological status of knowledge, the problem of an objective reality and the question of our subjective relationship to others objects in the world. * Obscurantism: Opposition to extension or dissemination of knowledge beyond certain limits and to questioning dogmas. Obscurantism is the opposite of freethought and is often associated with religious fundamentalism by its opponents. Indeed, it is a commonly raised accusation in debates on academic freedom, with anti-communists and others associating it with the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel and his followers (including Karl Marx) and more recently with opponents of Martin Heidegger doing the same. * Observation: An activity of a sapient or sentient living being, which senses and assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon in its framework of previous knowledge and ideas. * Observational learning: (or social learning) Learning that occurs as a function of observing, retaining and replicating behavior observed in others. It is most associated with the work of psychologist Albert Bandura, who implemented some of the seminal studies in the area and initiated social learning theory. Although observational learning can take place at any stage in life, it is thought to be particularly important during childhood, particularly as authority becomes important. * Of Education: Published in 1644, first appearing anonymously as a single eight-page quarto sheet (Ainsworth 6). Presented as a letter written in response to a request from the Puritan educational reformer Samuel Hartlib, it represents John Milton's most comprehensive statement on educational reform, and gives voice to his views ‚Äúconcerning the best and noblest way of education‚Äù. As outlined in the tractate, education carried for Milton a dual objective: one public, to ‚Äúfit a man to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices, both private and public, of peace and war‚Äù; and the other private, to ‚Äúrepair the ruins of our first parents by regaining to know God aright, and out of that knowledge to love Him, to be like Him, as we may the nearest by possessing our soul of true virtue‚Äù. * Open problem: A problem that can be formally stated and for which a solution is known to exist but which has not yet been solved. It is common in graduate schools to point out open problems to students. * Operant conditioning: (so named by psychologist B. F. Skinner) The modification of behavior brought about over time by the consequences of said behavior. Operant conditioning is distinguished from Pavlovian conditioning in that operant conditioning deals with voluntary behavior explained by its consequences, while Pavlovian conditioning deals with involuntary behavior triggered by its antecedents. Participants on a ropes course. * Outdoor education: (also known as adventure education) Usually refers to organized learning that takes place in the outdoors. Programs often involve residential or journey-based experiences in which students participate in a variety of adventurous challenges such as hiking, climbing, canoeing, ropes courses, and group games. Outdoor education programs draw upon the philosophy and theory of experiential education and may also focus on environmental education. * Overlearning: A pedagogical concept according to which newly acquired skills should be practiced well beyond the point of initial mastery, leading to automaticity.

It is to geography what historiography is to history; it deals with the nature and expression of geographical knowledge both past and present--with what Whittlesey has called ‚Äòman‚Äôs sense of [terrestrial] space‚Äô. Thus it extends far beyond the core area of scientific geographical knowledge or of geographical knowledge as otherwise systematized by geographers. Taking into account the whole peripheral realm, it covers the geographical ideas, both true and false, of all manner of people--not only geographers, but farmers and fishermen, business executives and poets, novelists and painters, Bedouins and Hottentots--and for this reason it necessarily has to do in large degree with subjective conceptions. :(Wright 1947) This has been summarised as: :the study of the world as people conceive of and imagine it :(McGreevy 1987) Belief systems as they relate to human interaction with the Earth's environments. : (attributed to Professor Innes Park 1995) Superstition Geosophy is sometimes used as a synonym for the study of earth mysteries.

Plot summary Blair Maynard, a divorced journalist in New York City, decides to write a story about the unexplained disappearance of yachts and other small boats in the Caribbean, hoping to debunk theories about the Bermuda Triangle. He has week-end custody of his preadolescent son Justin, and decides to mix a vacation with work, taking his son along. They fly from Miami to the Turks and Caicos island chain but, while on a fishing trip, are captured by a band of pirates. The pirates have, amazingly, remained undetected since the establishment of their pirate enclave by Jean-David Nau, the notorious buccaneer L'Olonnais, in 1671. The pirates have a constitution of sorts, called the Covenant, and have a cruel but workable society. They raise any children they capture to ensure the survival of the colony, but kill anyone over the age of thirteen years. In short order, Justin is brain-washed and groomed to lead the pirate band, much to Maynard's horror.

The city community planning boundaries are Alameda Street on the west which blends into Little Tokyo, First Street on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south. Largely composed of industrial buildings dating from the early 20th century, the area has recently been revitalized, and its street scene slowly developed in the early the 21st century. New art galleries have increased recognition of the area amidst the entire downtown where other art museums are found. Early history Spanish priest Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil. This inspired a passage in his journal that states: \\"Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels.\\" The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781. Vignes Street is named for Jean-Louis Vignes, an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the southern France thrived. By 1849 El Aliso, Vignes' vineyard named for the sacred local sycamore tree, was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area's past. By the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruits had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area, and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith, who filmed parts of Hollywood's first feature film In Old California there in 1909. A print shop became the area's first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country. The growing Santa Fe Freight Depot and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry's shipping needs determined the area's economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the district's structures that have survived earthquakes, flood, and fire. The single-room hotels for rail workers to the northwest, and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and Chinatown to the north, created a mix of working-class and cosmopolitan. By World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges. Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters‚Äìor simply failed‚Äîand an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era. In the 1950s many manufacturing companies moved overseas or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and the lowering of property values. Artists struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation and in 1981 the city passed the Artist-In-Residence (AIR) bill. This allowed artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they obtained a business license. To make living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted. New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have room to sleep, a fire alarm, and other requirements. Art scene In 1969, Allen Ruppersberg presented Al's Cafe at 1913 West Sixth Street. In the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, Jon Peterson, Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, Coleen Sterritt, Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and creating living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial \\"Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara\\" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid-1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, Merion Estes, Joe Fay, George Herms, Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, Paul McCarthy, Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, Lari Pittman, John Schroeder, Judith Simonian, Andy Wilf, and Takako Yamaguchi. LA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at the Brewery Art Colony and in Little Tokyo. In 1979, Marc Kreisel opened Al's Bar in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beck, the Fall, the Residents, introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups. The popular sound band Party Boys played the bars and art events. Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the West Coast's oldest punk club, finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments. Stephen Seemayer's film The Young Turks(2012) documents the 1979‚Äì1981 years. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artist and musician haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. The Rico Gallery opened in 1988 closed in 1991, Julie Rico Gallery lived on in Santa Monica, CA. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open. Around 1980, Jon Peterson and Stephen Seemayer opened \\"DTLA,\\" a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. High Performance magazine used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. In that year, Paul McCarthy performed Monkey Man during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1. The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where Beck got his start. In 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its \\"Artist in Residence\\" or \\"AIR\\" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation.Gerber, Marisa (July 29, 2014) \\"Arts District's changing landscape is worrisome to longtime residents\\" Los Angeles Times Retrieved 15 October 2018 Art galleries, cafes, and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. During the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi, on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al's bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music, and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a unsafe curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations, and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists' bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite. In 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated \\"Off the Street,\\" a \\"one-time art exhibition\\" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs, and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.Fritz Frauchiger. Off the Street. City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. 1985 In 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994‚Äì1998. DADA 1994 ArtistsAfter 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom's General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago's Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District's once and only unofficial mayor. (Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction, and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square.Nelson, Valerie J. (July 14, 2007) \\"Joel Bloom, 59; activist helped shape the arts district in L.A.\\" Los Angeles Times) Cornerstone Theater, an enterprise that brings community theater to locations all around the country, resided on Traction Avenue for 20 years. Around the corner, on Hewitt at 4th Place, the nonprofit ArtShare offers lessons in art, dance, theater, and music to urban youth and features a small theater once used by Padua Playwrights. Padua stages plays around the city, often in non-traditional environments, and hosts playwriting workshops. In February 2020 the website la-artsdistrict.com la- artsdistrict.com was launched to highlight Arts District mural art and artists to the public.

Challenges facing the district today include the loss of affordable live/work lofts, artists, and historically significant buildings.Khouri, Andrew (June 12, 2014) \\"Downtown condo shortage shuts out buyers\\" Los Angeles Times Community leaders are struggling to create balance amidst the economic issues brought about by gentrification and the need to preserve the character of the Arts District as a creative community that has made contributions to the cultural and economic well-being of the city for decades.Khouri, Andrew (September 25, 2014) \\"Upscale new residential complex opens in L.A. arts district\\" Los Angeles Times In 2014, the average annual income for neighborhood residents was $120,000.Vincent, Roger (November 13, 2014) \\"Old Coca-Cola building in L.A. to be refreshed as plush office complex\\" Los Angeles Times Retrieved 15 October 2018 While the initial decades saw the conversion to residential and commercial uses of low-slung warehouses and industrial spaces, downtown zoning laws could be rewritten to permit the heights of buildings to double, allowing up to 1,500 new residential units to be built in eight-story, edifices.Saillant, Catherine (December 1, 2014) \\"Some fear Arts District development plan would ruin the neighborhood\\" Los Angeles Times The Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) resides in a quarter-mile-long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot built in 1907 that has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Across the street is a 438-unit apartment complex, One Santa Fe, which opened in 2014 and was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA). The century-old Coca-Cola manufacturing plant at 4th and Merrick Streets, around the corner from the oversize Santa Fe railroad dock that houses SCI-Arc, is the latest in adaptive reuse into creative spaces. The three-story brick-clad building was described as the \\"headquarters for the company's Pacific Coast business and for its export trade in the Hawaiian Islands and Old Mexico\\" when it was built in 1915. The complex has been renamed Fourth & Traction after Traction Avenue. The Hauser Wirth & Schimmel complex opened in 2016 in buildings that date from the 1890s to the 1940s that occupy an entire city block on East 3rd Street. The district continues to be a popular location for filming due to its historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood's business improvement district stated that \\"There's not one day where there's not shooting.\\" The popular TV sitcom New Girl takes place largely in an apartment loft located in the Arts District. Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also, many formerly empty lots and streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers. In 2017 developer Suncal proposed a $2 billion, 1.95 million square-foot mixed-use project which includes two 58-story buildings designed by Herzog and de Meuron. The project, called \\"6 am,\\" will be located along 6th Street between Mills and Alameda. The live/work space will include 1,700 apartments and condos, shops, offices, hotels, charter schools, and an underground garage. Condos average price will be &1,000 per square foot. New developments have displaced artists since they can no longer afford to be in the Arts District. In 2016 the median price for the property was $714,500. It's a huge increase from 2013 when open lofts were priced at 370 per square foot. In 2017, the district received a $15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks, and street lighting. The program will bring two signalized intersections, pedestrian lighting, four pedestrian crosswalks, and one mile of bike lanes. Little Tokyo and Arts District Regional Connector Station will have pedestrian and bicycle access with the new Sixth Street Bridge. Warner Music Group moved into a building in 2019 that formerly housed a Ford Motor Company assembly plant.  Transportation  The Arts District is located near the center of Downtown Los Angeles making it more accessible to alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda Street. The cross streets are along East First and East Temple Streets. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt Street. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. #740 East 3rd Street # 999 East 3rd Street # 1245 Factory Place # 1301 Willow Street # 720 East Temple Street There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District. As the area became a social hub for city folk, parking became an issue to local residents. Public and private lots/structures including on-street parking offer a variety of parking options for visitors.

Less than a dozen specimens are known to exist today, and they generally fetch substantial prices; an uncirculated silver center cent sold at auction for $414,000 in January 2002. That price was eclipsed by an example graded PCGS MS61 offered at auction in April 2012, with a price tag of more than $1 million. Origins The silver center cent was an early attempt to reduce the size of the cent while maintaining its intrinsic value. During the early years of the American republic, there was a general consensus that the intrinsic bullion value of the new nation's coinage should be approximately equal to its face value. Some merchants would refuse to accept coins that did not meet this standard. For most denominations, bullion parity was achieved by producing the coins in a gold or silver alloy. However, the Coinage Act of 1792 specified that the cent was to consist of 11 pennyweight (264 grains or 17.1 g) of pure copper. Such a weight, needed to maintain intrinsic value, would have been too heavy for practical everyday use. U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson suggested an alternative: a coin made of an alloy that was primarily copper, but that included enough silver to give a reasonably-sized coin an intrinsic value of one cent. This billon alloy was considered by the U.S. Mint, The J2/P2 pattern has the same design as the silver center cent, but consists of a solid planchet with no silver plug. At least one specimen is made of a billon alloy -- see here. but U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton feared that it would be too susceptible to counterfeiting, since its appearance differed little from that of pure copper. In 1792, the Mint's chief coiner, Henry Voigt, hit upon a solution: a copper planchet, slightly smaller than that of a modern quarter, The silver center cent has a diameter of roughly 23mm, according to CoinFacts.com. The U.S. Mint's specifications page on modern coinage lists the quarter's diameter at 24.26mm. with a small silver \\"plug\\" inserted in a center hole during the striking process. The silver plug would have been worth approximately ¬¢ at contemporary bullion prices, while the copper planchet added an additional ¬¢ of intrinsic value. Several such coins were produced as test pieces. Ultimately, the additional labor required for these bimetallic coins proved unsuitable for mass production, and the large cent that was produced for circulation starting in 1793 consisted of 208 grains of 100% copper. Design The obverse of the silver center cent features a Liberty head with flowing hair. The date appears below the portrait, and the words \\"LIBERTY PARENT OF SCIENCE & INDUST.\\" are inscribed in a circular pattern around the central devices. The reverse design consists of a wreath with the words \\"ONE CENT\\" in the center, and the fraction \\"1/100\\" below. Surrounding the wreath, \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" is inscribed.

Palermo - Historical view of the Botanical Garden. The Orto Botanico di Palermo (Palermo Botanical Garden) is both a botanical garden and a research and educational institution of the Department of Botany of the University of Palermo. The garden lies within the city of Palermo, Italy at above sea-level. It covers about on top of red soil that has evolved on a limestone tuff substratum. Brief history The earliest beginnings of the gardens go back to 1779, when the Accademia dei Regi Studi created the chair of \\"Botany and medicinal properties\\". A modest plot of land was allocated to develop a small botanical garden dedicated to the cultivation of plants with medicinal benefits, for the twin objectives of general learning and improving public health. This initial garden allotment soon proved insufficient for the purposes for which it was intended, and in 1786 it was decided to move to the present site, right next to the Piano di Sant'Erasmo, best remembered for the unfortunate events that occurred there during the Spanish Inquisition. In 1789 construction of the main part of the administrative buildings of the garden commenced in a neoclassical style. It is constructed with a central building, the Gymnasium, and two side buildings, the Tepidariumand the Caldarium, designed by the Frenchman L√©on Dufourny, who had also designed a part of the oldest section of garden, right next to the Gymnasium. Its rectangular layout is divided into four quadrangles, within which the species are categorised according to Carl Linnaeus' system of classification. The new garden was opened in 1795; in the ensuing years it was improved, with the Aquarium (1798), a great pool hosting numerous species of aquatic plants, and the serra Maria Carolina (or Maria Carolina glasshouse), completed in 1823. The huge Ficus macrophylla, which is an emblem and a well- known attraction of the modern garden, was imported from Norfolk Island (Australia), in 1845. Today's area, some 10 hectares, was reached in 1892, following successive extensions. In 1913 the Giardino coloniale (Colonial garden) was developed alongside the botanic gardens, but that no longer exists. The gardens have been managed by the Department of Botany since 1985.

Francesco Maria Raimondo } Map of the gardens Buildings, features and the collection=Gymnasium, Calidarium and Tepidarium The central neo-classical building, known as the Gymnasium, is located near the main entrance gate. Originally it was the main office of the Schola Regia Botanice (school of botany), the Herbarium, the library and the director's office. Two smaller buildings are located either side of the Gymnasium in perfect symmetry. To this day they are called the Calidarium and the Tepidarium because originally they housed plants from warm and temperate zones respectively (caldo meaning \\"hot\\" in Italian). Linneian section This is the oldest section of the gardens, laid out in a rectangular shape and divided into four quadrangles, the \\"quatrains\\" (or quartini). Each quatrain is further divided into flowerbeds, within which the plants were originally organised along the lines of the Linneian system of classification. The design of this section has gradually changed over time to display certain specimens at the expense of others that are now gone. At the centre of this section, is the particularly evocative ‚Äúcross‚Äù, the small plaza that results from the intersection of the central axis (the Viale centrale) with the tree lined avenue of palms (the Viale delle palme). The Aquarium and other water features Aquarium The Aquarium, a large round pool divided into 24 sections, is located at the end of the central avenue. The design consists of three concentric rings which are divided into 8 wedges, each being a home to a variety of acqautic flora. The \\"lagoon\\" is located a few metres further down from the Acquariam and is another ample water feature in which the plants are arranged informally. Other smaller ponds are located in the quatrains of the Linneian section. The greenhouses Over time the gardens have benefitted from the development of a series of greenhouses that currently comprise a surface area of some 1,300 mq. The oldest of these greenhouses is the serra Maria Carolina (serra is Italian for greenhouse), a gift from Queen Maria Carolina of Austria, also known as the Giardino d'Inverno (the winter garden). Originally it was constructed of wood and heated by stoves, over the course of the second half of the 19th century, it was completely rebuilt of cast-iron. Other greenhouses include: *the greenhouse of succulents, containing plants from hot-arid zones; *the experimental greenhouse, that currently house bananas and papaya ; *the greenhouse of the region, containing plants of the warm-humid zones; *the greenhouse for the preservation of succulents, an annex of the Department of Botany; *the greenhouse of ferns. Bioecological and geographic zone In this section plants are arranged according to bioecological and geographic criteria. Here one finds the Giardino a succulente (\\"Garden of succulents\\"), consisting of an assortment of plants from the arid zones of Africa; the Palmetum; the Cycadetum; e la collinetta mediterranea (mediterranean hillside) which includes various significant species endemic to the Mediterranean, including some specimens which represent rare and endangered species. Experimental and research zone In the experimental zone, situated to the side of the Winter Garden, tropical and subtropical plants are cultivated for the purposes of research. Studies currently in train or recently undertaken include those on cotton, vegetables, sugar cane and sorghum. The zone dedicated to plants of a practical application, which extends over the south west part of the gardens, consists of terrain set apart for plants yielding a variety of oils, resins and fibres. Engler's zone Also known as the nuovo settore (the new zone), it comprises the southern section of the gardens within which the plants are arranged in accordance with the classification system of Engler. The species are partitioned into three sections, each dedicated in turn to the gymnosperms, the angiosperms, the dicotyledons and the liliopsida. The herbarium The modern Herbarium mediterraneum, accommodated within a few buildings adjacent to the gardens, covers a surface area of some 6,000 m¬≤. The main part of the collection comprises the Erbario Siculo and the Erbario Generale of the Department of Botany, estimated to be around 50,000 and 200,000 specimens respectively. Of the latter group, around a quarter represent plants native to the mediterranean. The non Sicilian specimens are mainly from Portugal, Spain, France, Corsica, Sardinia, Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Algeria and Egypt. It also includes around 2,000 specimens of algae, 1,600 of lichen, 4,700 of bryophyte and a thousand odd of fungus. Gene bank The gene bank, having been started in 1993, is part of a broader project to protect the genetic material of the region's flora. The main objective of the bank is the conservation ex situ, both short and long term, of all seeds endemic to the region, rare or endangered. Once they have been collected, the seeds are immediately treated and conserved in ampoules, all managed by the institution and available for exchange with others. The seeds are periodically tested for their propensity to germinate. The bank forms part of the RIBES network (Rete Italiana delle Banche per la conservazione Ex-Situ del germoplasma). Summary of the species present (See also the full list of species of plants growing in the gardens further below). The typical aerial roots of the Ficus macrophylla (or the Moreton Bay Fig) The gardens are currently home to at least 12,000 different species. Having been developed during the great age of exploration, between the second half of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century the gardens became an important point of reference for the bigger botanical gardens of Northern Europe. Because of Palermo's favourable climate, they transferred a good number of unknown, poorly classified and exotic tropical species there. In this context, the relationship between the Berlin Botanic Garden, under the stewardship of Adolf Engler, and those of the originating areas of the new world proved to be extremely important. As an illustrative example of the role of the Palermo Botanic Garden, consider the introduction into the Mediterranean of the mandarin (Citrus deliciosa) and the loquat (Eriobotrya japonica). The early linneian plantings consisted of 1,580 different species, of which 658 still exist. Of these specimens, the most notable is the mighty Ginkgo biloba. The Laghetto of papyrus In the Aquarium many species of Nymphaea are to be found, including Nymphaea alba, Nymphaea tuberosa hybrids of Nymphaea √ó marliacea, the multicoloured Nuphar lutea and Nelumbum nucifera. Moreover, in the areas further in that are not submerged but humid nevertheless, one finds Alocasia, Colocasia, Zantedeschia, while in a nearby pond, the so-called laghetto, Egyptian papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) and other cyperaceae such as Scirpus lacustris and Cyperus alternifolius are absolutely thriving. Various species of bamboo grow nearby and directly behind here, atop a small artificial hill, there is a healthy specimen of the drago tree (Dracaena draco). Not too far away one can see the tallest plant of the gardens, a magnificent Araucaria columnaris, and the largest overall in terms of volume, a gigantic specimen of Ficus macrophylla, with its typical aerial roots, imported from Norfolk Island (a territory of Australia in the Pacific Ocean), in 1845. It is also a native of the east coast of Australia and is known as the Moreton Bay Fig. The giardino a succulente (the garden of succulents) of the bioecological zone is home to numerous species of the genus Aloe e various other plants of arid regions, including Cereus, Crassula, Euphorbia and Opuntia. Alongside the collection of succulents, there is a huge specimen of Ficus rubiginosa, recreating an environment reminiscent of a tropical jungle. In the area containing Cycadetum there are certain species of cicadi that have a notable history. Of these we have Cycas revoluta, donated by Queen Maria Carolina in 1793, was the first such specimen to find a permanent home in Europe. In the following stage of the gardens' development Zamiaceae Ceratozamia mexicana and Dioon edule, were both introduced from Mexico, as was Cycas circinalis, an elegant species from the Indian sub- continent. In 1997 the collection was further improved by the acquisition of a variety of worthy specimens, including Dioon spinulosum, Encephalartos altensteinii, Encephalartos longifolius, Encephalartos villosus, Macrozamia moorei and Zamia furfuracea. Washingtonia filifera In the area dedicated to palms one can find Chamaerops humilis, the only palm native to Sicily, and numerous exotic palms, in which the gardens are particularly blessed. Amongst both potted and fully cultivated specimens, one can count a good 34 genera and around 80 species. The genus Washingtonia is represented by W. filifera, that flowered in Palermo for the first time ever, and by W. robusta. In the genus Phoenix, apart from the common date (Phoenix dactylifera) there are also P. rupicola, P. reclinata, P. canariensis, P. roebelenii and P. teophrastii. There are also many other genera: Chamaedorea, Brahea, Sabal, Erythea, Livistona, Howea and Trachycarpus. The Giardino d'Inverno (Winter Garden) is home to a number of species native to the warmer climes of Africa, Central America, South America, Asia and Australia. Amongst those that are worth a brief mention, we have the coffee plant (Coffea arabica), papaya (Carica papaya), numerous species of Bougainvillea, cinnamon (Cinnamomum ceylanicum), (Parmentiera cereifera) and mimosa (Mimosa spegazzinii). In the serra della Regione (glasshouse of the regions), there are potted specimens of (Ravenala madagascariensis) (the traveller's palm) and various species of Anthurium, Codiaeum, Pandanus and other plants from tropical and equatorial climes. Two smaller glasshouses are located alongside this one, housing orchids and carnivorous plants respectively. Also notable is the collection of succulents contained in the similarly titled glasshouse, amongst which we find specimens of Echinocactus grusonii of considerable dimensions. In the Settore Sperimentale e delle Piante Utili (Experimental zone and zone of practical plantings) plants which produce foodstuffs are exhibited, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and (Sorghum saccharatum), both used for the production of sugar; avocado (Persea americana), various cultivars of banana (Musa acuminata √ó balbisiana), pecan nut, not to mention an extensive collection of vegetable plants with over 100 cultivars of great historical interest and hugely important in terms of the conservation of a local gene pool. Lastly we have the medicinal plantings, including Artemisia absinthium, Datura stramonium, ginseng (Withania somnifera), la camphour (Cinnamomum canphora) and the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). {valign=\\"top\\"  ;A * Acalypha hispida * Aeonium leucoblepharum * Agaphantus umbellatus * Aloe arborescens * Aloe saponaria * Aloe thraskii * Aloe xcaesia * Aloe xriccobonii * Aloe xspinosissima * Aloiampelos ciliaris (syn.

Early life  Berblinger was the seventh child of a poor family. When he was 13 his father died and he was sent to an orphanage. There he was forced to become a tailor although he wanted to become a watchmaker. He became a master craftsman at 21, but he still was interested in mechanics. In his spare time in 1808 he invented the first artificial limb with a joint.  Flight attempts  Berblinger's design drawing of his glider on a GDR stamp One of Berblinger's inventions was what appears to be a hang glider. He worked on it for years, improving it and watching the flight of owls. People made fun of him and he was threatened with exclusion from the guild. He was ordered to pay a large fine for his working outside of the guild. Nevertheless, he invested his whole income in his project. King Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg became interested in his work and sponsored him with 20 Louis. He tried to demonstrate the glider on the evening of 30 May 1811 in the presence of the king, his three sons and the crown prince of Bavaria. The king and a large number of citizens waited for the flight but Berblinger cancelled it, claiming that his glider was damaged. The next day he made a second attempt from a higher location ‚Äì the Adlerbastei (Eagles Bastion).This structure no longer exists but a plaque commemorates it on the banks of the river in Neue Strasse just past the Dreifaltigkeitskirche (Holy Trinity Church) The King had left by this time, but his brother Duke Heinrich and the princes stayed to watch. Berblinger waited so long for a good wind that a policeman finally gave him a push and Berblinger fell into the Donau (Danube). Other versions of this account have no mention of the policeman and claim that the difference in temperature over the cold Donau (Danube) limited thermal updrafts and therefore the glider failed to lift. He survived and was rescued by fishermen, but his reputation was ruined as a result and his work suffered. He was 58 years old when he died in a hospital. The story of the tailor, who tried to fly, subsequently resulted in some fleer and allusions in publications of the 19th century. When Wilhelm Busch drew a man falling into a stream in his picture story \\"Max and Moritz\\", he could count on some awareness of his readers. It was not until the end of the century that Otto Lilienthal proved the feasibility of heavier-than-air flight.  Reception  * A reconstruction of Berblinger's flying device (in the form of a pair of wings) can be seen in the Ulm Rathaus (City Hall) suspended above the stairwell near the Standesamt (Registrary) where civil weddings are held. There is also another reconstruction of the glider in the ground level of building B in the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Science) Ulm. * In 1986 it was proven that Berblinger's glider was capable of sustained flight, but it was almost impossible to cross the Danube even with most modern gliders. * Bertolt Brecht wrote a ballad about Berblinger in 1934.

It was first presented at the 1999 SEMA Show. It is essentially a redesigned Prowler which addressed some of the complaints and problems existing Prowler owners had. The lack of cargo space in the Prowler was universally lamented, so the Howler addressed this by elongating and squaring off the back end, creating a moderate sized trunk. The Prowler was only available as a 3.5L V6 that was rated at ~250 hp at its highest. For what was considered to be a modern \\"hot rod\\", this was not considered to be enough power, so the Howler was given a 4.7L V8 - which had nearly the same horsepower, but had significantly more torque. The engine is mated to a five speed manual transmission, instead of the Prowler's four speed automatic. This freed up some room in the undercarriage to enlarge the gas tank for the thirstier V8. The Howler also has a removable hardtop instead of the traditional ragtop of the Prowler. The top is manually removed, and can be stored in a compartment behind the seats. Though the concept was appreciated by most Prowler enthusiasts, the low sales volume of the Prowler and the ultimate demise of the Plymouth nameplate ensured that the Howler was never made into a production vehicle.

Many former bishoprics remained heads of the new dioceses, but many cities lost their bishop. But the papacy did not accept those changes, and for more than a decade, the new French ecclesiastical hierarchy was technically in schism with Rome. In 1801, following the Concordate First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte signed with Pope Pius VI, a compromise was found, but it was not before the late 1810s that a stable ecclesiastical organisation was reached, in which one diocese was more or less coterminous with one department. A few exceptions were retained, especially in departments where there was a particularly numerous population. In December 2002, Pope John Paul II completely redrew the map of French ecclesiastical provinces: for this, see the post-2002 List of the Roman Catholic dioceses of France. The following is a list of French ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses from 1825 to 2002. Except where stated, one diocese coincided with one department.

This page contains terms starting with P ‚Äì R. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. P * Paradigm shift: The term first used by Thomas Kuhn in his famous 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions to describe the process and result of a change in basic assumptions within the ruling theory of science. Don Tapscott was the first to use the term to describe information technology and business in his book of the same title. It has since become widely applied to many other realms of human experience as well. * Peace education: The process of acquiring the knowledge and developing the attitudes, skills, and behaviour to live in harmony with oneself and with others. :Peace education is based on a philosophy that teaches nonviolence, love, compassion, trust, fairness, cooperation, respect, and a reverence for the human family and all life on our planet. It is a social practice with shared values to which anyone can make a significant contribution. * Pedagogy: The art or science of teaching. The word comes from the ancient Greek paidagogos, the slave who took little boys to and from school as part of paideia. The word \\"paidia\\" (œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒπŒ¨) refers to children, which is why some like to make the distinction between pedagogy (teaching children) and andragogy (teaching adults). The Latin word for pedagogy, education, is much more widely used, and often the two are used interchangeably. Leonardo da Vinci * Personal development: (also known as self-development or personal growth) Comprises the development of the self. The term may also refer to: traditional concepts of education or training; counselling and coaching for personal transformation; New Age movement and spiritual beliefs & concepts - including \\"inner pathways\\" to solve social and psychological issues; or professional development business trainers (some treat the whole person instead of business only). * Philosophy of education: The study of the purpose, nature and ideal content of education. Other questions include the nature of the knowing mind and the human subject, problems of authority, the relationship between education and society, etc. At least since Rousseau's time, the philosophy of education has been linked to theories of developmental psychology and human development. * Phonicetic: Of or relating to the enhancement of meaning through the use of phonemes. The added layers of meaning due to the intentional use of sounds within an existing phonetic structure. Educational/technical jargon. * Physical education: (PE, also called physical training - PT or gym) A course in the curriculum which utilizes the learning medium of large-muscle activities in a play or movement exploration setting. It is almost always mandatory for students in elementary schools, and often for students in middle schools and high schools. * Physics education: A relatively new, yet active, area of research within the science of physics. The main focus of research is on learning and teaching of physics in both the highschool and college level. * Polymath: (also known as a polyhistor) A person who excels in multiple fields, particularly in both arts and sciences. The most common other term for this phenomenon is Renaissance man, but also in use are Homo universalis and Uomo Universale, which in Latin and Italian, respectively, translate as \\"Universal Person\\" or \\"Universal Man\\". Note that in Latin homo may be male or female; the Latin word for a male human being vir. Informally used in contemporary discussion, a polymath is someone known to be skillful or excel in a broad range of intellectual fields. Post-graduate student receiving a degree. * Postgraduate education: (or Quaternary education) The fourth-stage educational level, and follows the completion of an undergraduate degree at a college or university. Graduate school is an example of quaternary education; some consider masters-level degrees as part of tertiary education; some consider postdoctoral positions to be quaternary education while others consider them to be jobs. * Post-secondary education: Any form of education that is taken after first attending a secondary school, such as a high school. The purpose of a post-secondary education can be to receive vocational education and training or to prepare for professions or scientific/academic careers through higher education. * Predictive power: (of a scientific theory) Refers to its ability to generate testable predictions. Theories with strong predictive power are highly valued, because the predictions can often encourage the falsification of the theory. The concept of predictive power differs from explanatory or descriptive power (where phenomena that are already known are retrospectively explained by a given theory) in that it allows a prospective test of theoretical understanding. * Preschool education: See Nursery school. * Primary education: (or elementary education) Consists of the first years of formal, structured education that occurs during childhood. In most countries, it is compulsory for children to receive primary education (though in many jurisdictions it is permissible for parents to provide it). Primary education generally begins when children are four to seven years of age. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about twelve years of age (adolescence); some educational systems have separate middle schools for that period. * Problem finding: Problem discovery. It is part of the larger problem process that includes problem shaping and problem solving. Problem finding requires intellectual vision and insight into what is missing. This involves the application of creativity. * Problem shaping: Revising a question so that the solution process can begin or continue. It is part of the larger problem process that includes problem finding and problem solving. Problem shaping (or problem framing) often involves the application of critical thinking. * Problem solving: Forms part of thinking. It occurs if an organism or an artificial intelligence system does not know how to proceed from a given state to a desired goal state. It is part of the larger problem process that includes problem finding and problem shaping. * Problem-based learning: (PBL) A didactic concept of \\"active learning\\" in tertiary education, but is currently being adapted for use in K‚Äì12 education. The defining characteristics of PBL are: learning is driven by messy, open-ended problems; students work in small collaborative groups; and \\"teachers\\" are not required, the process uses \\"facilitators\\" of learning. :Accordingly, students are encouraged to take responsibility for their group and organise and direct the learning process with support from a tutor or instructor. Advocates of PBL claim it can be used to enhance content knowledge and foster the development of communication, problem-solving, and self-directed learning skill. * Procedural knowledge: (or know-how) The knowledge of how to perform some task. Know-how is different from other kinds of knowledge such as propositional knowledge in that it can be directly applied to a task. Procedural knowledge about solving problems differs from propositional knowledge about problem solving. For example, in some legal systems, this knowledge or know-how has been considered the intellectual property of a company, and can be transferred when that company is purchased. * Professional certification: (trade certification, or professional designation often called simply certification or qualification) A designation earned by a person to certify that he is qualified to perform a job. Certification indicates that the individual has a specific knowledge, skills, or abilities in the view of the certifying body. Professional certifications are awarded by professional bodies and corporations. The difference between licensure and certification is licensure is required by law, whereas certification is generally voluntary. Sometimes the word certification is used for licensure. * Programmed instruction: A field first studied extensively by the behaviorist B. F. Skinner. It consists of teaching through small lessons, where each lesson must be mastered in order to go on to the next. Students work through the programmed material by themselves at their own speed. After each step, they are presented with a question to test their comprehension, then are immediately shown the correct answer or given additional information. * Propositional knowledge: (or declarative knowledge) Knowledge that some proposition is either true or false. This distinguishes propositional knowledge from know-how or procedural knowledge, which is the knowledge of how to perform some task. This article discusses propositional knowledge from a variety of perspectives, including philosophy, science, and history. :What is the difference between knowledge and beliefs? A belief is an internal thought or memory which exists in one's mind. Most people accept that for a belief to be knowledge it must be, at least, true and justified. The Gettier problem in philosophy is the question of whether there are any other requirements before a belief can be accepted as knowledge. * Public education: Schooling provided for the general public by the government, whether national or local, and paid for by taxes, which leads to it often being called state education. Schools provided under such a system are called public schools in many countries, but in England the term \\"public school\\" refers to an elite of privately funded independent schools which had their origins in medieval schools funded by charity to provide education for the poor. :Public education often involves the following: public funding; compulsory student attendance; state certification of teachers and curricula; and testing and national standards. * Public school: The term has different (and in some cases contradictory) meanings due to regional differences. * Pygmalion effect: (or Rosenthal effect) refers to situations in which students perform better than other students simply because they are expected to do so. Q * Quiz: A form of game or puzzle in which the players (as individuals or in teams), attempt to answer questions correctly. A quiz usually is a form of student assessment, but often has fewer questions of lesser difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test. R Reading a book * Reading (process): The process of retrieving and comprehending some form of stored information or ideas. These ideas are usually some sort of representation of language, as symbols to be examined by sight, or by touch (for example Braille). Other types of reading may not be language-based, such as music notation or pictograms. By analogy, in computer science, reading is acquiring of data from some sort of computer storage. * Reading disability: A condition in which a sufferer displays difficulty reading resulting primarily from neurological factors. * Reading education in the USA: There are basically two different common methods of teaching reading. One usually refers to whole language approach (\\"look say\\"), the other usually refers to phonetics approach. The tension between these two approaches is often referred to as \\"the great debate\\". * Reason: A term used in philosophy and other human sciences to refer to the higher cognitive faculties of the human mind. It describes a type of thought or aspect of thought, especially abstract thought, and the ability to think abstractly, which is felt to be especially human. The concept of reason is connected to language, as reflected in the meanings of the Greek word \\"logos\\", later to be translated by Latin \\"ratio\\" and then French \\"raison\\", from which the English word. Reason is thus a very important word in western intellectual history and shares much of its heritage with the now separate words logic and rationality. * Reasoning: Defined very differently depending on the context of the understanding of reason as a form of knowledge. The Logical definition is the act of using reason, to derive a conclusion from certain premises, using a given methodology; and the two most commonly used explicit methods to reach a conclusion are deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. However, within idealist philosophical contexts, reasoning is the mental process which informs our imagination, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings with whatever intelligibility these appear to contain; and thus links our experience with universal meaning. The specifics of the methods of reasoning are of interest to such disciplines as philosophy, logic, psychology, and artificial intelligence. * Recitation: A discussion carried by a Teaching assistant to supplement a lecture given by a senior faculty at an academic institution. During the recitation, TAs will review the lecture, expand on the concepts, and carry a discussion with the students. * Reference: Something that refers or points to something else, or acts as a connection or a link between two things. The objects it links may be concrete, such as books or locations, or abstract, such as data, thoughts, or memories. The object which is named by a reference, or to which the reference points, is the referent. * Reinforcement: In operant conditioning, reinforcement is any change in an organism's surroundings that: occurs regularly when the organism behaves in a given way (that is, is contingent on a specific response); and is associated with an increase in the probability that the response will be made or in another measure of its strength. * Religious education: Teaches the doctrines of a religion. Its usual purpose is to teach children the basics of a religion. A less common purpose is to teach new adherents of a religion. :Since people within a given country often hold varying religious and non-religious beliefs, government-sponsored religious education can be a source of conflict. Countries vary widely in whether religious education is allowed in government- run schools (often called \\"public schools\\"). Those that allow it also vary in the type of education provided. * Research: Often described as an active, diligent, and systematic process of inquiry aimed at discovering, interpreting and revising facts. This intellectual investigation produces a greater understanding of events, behaviors, or theories, and makes practical applications through laws and theories. The term research is also used to describe a collection of information about a particular subject, and is usually associated with science and the scientific method. Rhodes House in Oxford * Rhodes Scholarships: Created by Cecil Rhodes and have been awarded to applicants annually since 1902 by the Oxford-based Rhodes Trust on the basis of academic qualities, as well as those of character. They provide the successful candidate with two years of study at the University of Oxford in England, possibly extended for a third year. :When Rhodes died in 1902, his will stipulated that the greater part of his fortune was to go toward the establishment of a scholarship fund to reward applicants who exhibited worthy qualities of intellect, character, and physical ability. * Rote learning: A learning technique which avoids grasping the inner complexities and inferences of the subject that is being learned and instead focuses on memorizing the material so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard. * Rubric (academic): In education, a rubric is a set of criteria and standards linked to learning objectives that is used to assess a student's performance, such as on a paper, project, or essay.

There is some debate as to when he was born. Some place his birth as early as 1749, but more recent scholarship suggests he was actually born in 1766. He was born in Vilna and died there on December 14, 1808. He was the son of Elijah, the Vilna Gaon, the most famous Talmudist of modern times. He was educated under the supervision of his father, who was famous both for his opposition to both the Hasidic movement, and the dry scholasticism which dominated the rabbinic leadership of Poland at that time. According to the custom of the time, he married at the age of twelve, but continued his studies in the Talmudic colleges in other cities, and after a few years returned home, where he completed his studies under his father. Like his father, he never officiated as rabbi, but was a highly respected member of the Jewish community of Vilna, in which he held various offices. Works It was due to his father's influence that he developed a literary activity of a far more scientific character than was usually found at that age or in that country. Especially interested in the history of the old homiletical literature, he edited the Midrash Agadat Bereshit with a number of other mostly pseudepigraphic works of similar character (Vilna, 1802), adding valuable notes. In the preface of this edition he makes the first known attempt to give a complete history of the midrashic literature. A plagiarist, Jacob ben Naphtali Herz of Brody, reprinted this edition with the preface (Zolkiev, 1804), but was careful to omit the name of Elijah Gaon wherever the son had mentioned him. He omitted, also, on the title-page the mention of Abraham of Vilna's edition, referring only to the one which had been printed in Venice in 1618. This introduction was only part of his greater work, Rav Po'alim (Of Many Works, published by Simon Chones, Warsaw, 1894). This book is an alphabetical index of all midrashim known to the author. It seems that Abraham of Vilna believed literally in the statement that the eighty concubines of King Solomon (Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 6:8) meant eighty midrashim. This is at least testified to by Samuel Luria in a letter to Simon Chones (Rab Po'alim, p. 9). The book, however, contains over one hundred and twenty midrashic works. While Abraham of Vilna shows greater interest in literature and literary questions than is found among his contemporaries, he accepts traditional attributions of authorship. He ascribes the Zohar to Shimon bar Yochai, in spite of the many arguments against its authenticity produced by various writers since the time of Abraham Zacuto.

Secular knowledge Abraham's interest in secular knowledge, quite rare in his environment, is also manifest in the writing of a Hebrew geography, Gebulot Ere·∫ì, published anonymously (Berlin, 1801).

They are recruited from common folk and taught their magic at the SolomonƒÉrie or ≈ûoloman≈£ƒÉ (German phonetization: Scholomance). General description The Solomonars are said to be tall, red-haired, wearing long white robes of peasants, sometimes woolen, or clad in ragged attire made from patches, and they are most often seen around begging for alms.: \\"comme un mendiant\\". The contents of their magic bag are instruments such as an iron ax, birchbark reins or bridle, a book of wisdom. A branch that has killed a snake is included in some lists. Once they are in the guise of beggars (often crippled or blindfolded beggars), they blend in with the populace so they cannot be distinguished as wizards.; German tr., However, they apparently have the knowledge and memory of which peasant's farm deserves his retribution when he acts as a dragon-rider sending down his hailstorm.; German tr., Schooling The Solomonari, by some accounts, are recruited from the people. They are taught their magic and the speech of animals at the school (Scholomance), and become capable of riding the dragons. Tradition says they became the Devil's students, either being instructed by him, or becoming a servant to his commands.Marian (1879), pp. 54‚Äì56; German tr., An additional belief was that the students were taught at the Devil's school which was situated underground, and that the students avoided the rays of the sun for the 7-year duration of their study. They were in fact a type of strigoi or vampire, according to S. F. Marian, who collected the folklore from the field.Marian (1879), pp. 54‚Äì56; German tr., : \\"Die Solomonari sind b√∂sartige Leute, eine Art ¬ªStrigoi¬´ (Vampyre)\\". Dragon- riders and weather The solomonari were regarded as dragon-riders who control the weather, causing thunder, or rain, or hail to fall. One way in which this belief was articulated was that a particular pupil out of the graduating class of ten would be selected by the Devil to become the designated Weather-maker () who rode the \\"Ismeju\\" dragon (German phoneticization of zmeu dragon). Or he became the \\"Devil's aide-de-camp\\" who rode the zmeu to make thunderbolts. Or thirdly, the Solomonariu would fly up into the skies, and whenever his dragon glanced at the clouds, rainfall would come. But God intervened to keep the dragon from growing too weary, lest it plummeted and devour a great part of the earth. A rather different presentation is that Solomonari who normally lived as beggars among the populace would occasionally engage himself for a fee to become the dragon- rider and hail-bringer. He selected which fields to damage, knowing which peasants behaved unkindly to them. A peasant may hire a \\"counter-Solomonari\\" (; pl. Contra-Solomonarƒ≠) to cast spells to divert the dragon-riding Solmomonari. In this version, the type of dragon they rode were the balauri (sing. balaur).Marian (1879): \\"C√Ænd voiesc Solomonarii sƒÉ se suie √Æn nori, iau friul cel de aur ≈üi se duc la un lac fƒÉrƒÉ de fund sau la o altƒÉ apƒÉ mare, unde ≈ütiu ei cƒÉ locuiesc balaurii\\", quoted in: Hasdeu, Bogdan Petriceicu; Br√¢ncu»ô, Grigore (1976) edd., ' 3, p. 438.Marian (1879), pp. 54‚Äì56, German (tr.), : \\"Mit diesem Zaum z√§umen die Solomonari die ihnen anstatt Pferde dienenden Drachen (Balauri)\\" or, \\"With this [golden] bridle, the Solomonari rein their dragons (balauri) that they use instead of horses\\". This dragon can be brought out of a bottomlessly deep lake by using \\"golden reins\\" or bridle (\\"; ), and the wizard and dragon would create storms or bring down hail. 19th century sources \\"Scholomance\\" and \\"Scholomonariu\\" appeared in print in the Austrian journal √ñsterreichische Revue in 1865, written by Wilhelm Schmidt (1817‚Äì1901) () The piece is discussed as a belief present in the Central Romanian Fogarasch (FƒÉgƒÉra»ô) district and beyond, with additional lore from Hermannstadt.; reissued: Emily Gerard later wrote on the topic of \\"Scholomance\\", although she only referred to its attendees as \\"scholars\\", and did not specifically employ the term Solomanari or the equivalent. Romanian ethnobotanist Simion Florea Marian described the Solmonari in his article on \\"Daco-Romanian Mythology\\" in the ' (1879.Marian, Simeon Florea (1879), \\"Mitologia daco-rom√¢nƒÉ\\", Albina Carpa»õilor III, pp. 54‚Äì56 Marian collected this folklore orally from the people in Siebenb√ºrgen (Transylvania) and the adjoining Bukovina-Moldavia region.  Nomenclature  Solomonar is the singular form, and the variant »òolomonar also listed. The German phonetization Scholomonar which is closer to the latter form was given by Gaster. The modern-day dictionary plural form in Romanian is Solomonari, and \\"solomonars\\" in the plural has been used in English translation. An old dictionary form in the plural »òolomonariu occurs in a lexicon published in 1825, where the term is glossed as ,, , and . Andrei Oi»ôteanu remarked that this form is rather dated. Scholomon√°riu is defined as Zauberer or \\"sorcerers\\" in an even earlier source, a glossary appended to a book dating from 1781. Etymologies The default explanation is that the word is connected to King Solomon via the addition of the occupational suffix \\"-ar\\", although this may be folk etymology. A folkloric account attests to the association with the biblical king. In an account given by Friedrich von M√ºller the \\"Kaiser Salomo\\" has the ability to control the weather, and the inheritors of his art are called \\"Scholomonar\\".Pointed out by Gaster, more complicatedly, suggested a hybrid of the word for the magic school Scholomantze (Romanian orthography: ≈ûoloman≈£ƒÉ) from association with Salamanca, and Solomonie (from Solomon).: \\"√én 1884, Moses Gaster a acordat apelativului √Æn discu≈£ie o etimologie combinatƒÉ: ‚Äû≈ûolomonar este rezultatul dintre ≈üoloman≈£ƒÉ [de la Salamanca ‚Äì n. A.O.] + solomonie [de la Solomon ‚Äì n. A.O.]\\" An alternate derivation from the German Schulm√§nner (\\"scholars\\"), in reference to the popular belief that solomonars attended a school, is credited to J. Vulcan.: \\" ¬ªScholomonari¬´ (d. h. ¬ªSchulm√§nner¬´ bemerkt .J. Vulcan).\\" Zeus hypothesis King Solomon as weather-maker may derive from the Greek myth of Zeus the king of gods controlling the weather, a theory proposed by A. Oi»ôteanuOi»ôteanu, Andrei (1990), p. 319. Cited by , \\"»ôolomon√°r\\", Dic»õionar. This notion that Solomon's adherents were wizards may have been popularized by the influence of the adventure tale Solomon and Morcolf.»òƒÉineanu. Titkin. Cited by , \\"»ôolomon√°r\\", Dic»õionar. Red Jews hypothesis As the Solomonari have been described as red-haired giants (, pl.), a connection to them and the legendary Red Jews (evreilor ro≈üii) has been suggested by . This hypothesis builds on LazƒÉr »òƒÉineanu's theory that giant/Jews in Romanian folklore derived from the historical Khazars, and Arthur Koestler bringing the notion of the \\"Red Jews\\" into that formulation (Koestler's The Thirteenth Tribe, the ultimate source being A. N. Poliak's book on the Khazars in Hebrew)., Ch. IV, Sect. 10: \\"To quote Poliak again: 'The popular Jewish legend does not remember a 'Khazar' kingdom but a kingdom of the 'Red Jews'\\"; partially quoted in and attributed (to Koestler) in note 58. Dacian ascetics hypothesis Similarity with the Geto-Dacian ascetics called the ktistai described by Strabo was noted by Traian Herseni (d. 1980) who hypothesized that they were the original Solomonari.; Herseni posited that the ktisai were more properly called \\"skistai\\" meaning \\"those who abstain from worldly pleasures\\", and that the cryptic byname that Strabo gave them Kapnobatai (which literally means \\"smoke- treaders\\") really meant \\"travelers in the clouds\\". The theory has found its strong proponent in Eugen Agrigoroaiei, who pronounced that the origins of the Solomonari had been established, and the Dacian cloud travelers must have been authentic Solomonari. Andrei Oi»ôteanu cautions that while \\"enticing\\", the \\"hypothesis remains as only as plausibility\\". He points out that a tradition kept alive from Caesar's time to the 19th century presents a credibility issue, since there is a complete vacuum in the records about any of it for the 1900-year interim. is another skeptic who referred to the idea as \\"speculation by Herseni\\".Coman, 1983, p. 123, cited by Parallels and synonyms Parallels with the legend of the Serbo-Croatian garabancija≈° dijak () \\"necromantic scholar\\" had been sought in Moses Gaster's paper, which is one a major source for the Solomanari folkloristics. The Croatian version was described by Vatroslav Jagiƒá and the Hungarian version by . A number of synonyms can be found in Romanian, including \\"zgrimin»õe»ô\\", and it is considered synonymous or closely connected to the widespread Balkan legend known in Serbo-Croatian (for example) as grabancija≈° dijak (\\"the necromancy student\\"). Additional details Some sources like to refer to the dragons that the Solomonari ride as \\"storm dragons\\". The riders may travel together with Moroi. Fearing their wrath, people usually ask a Master Stonemason for advice. This Master Stonemason is a former Solomonar himself, who dropped the craft in favor of being again amongst people; his knowledge is highly prized because he knows the secrets of Solomonars. The Solomonars were not supernatural creatures, but rather humans who learned special abilities. It is said that the children who become solomonar are born bearing a particular type of membrane on their head or on the whole of their body. Later, as the legend says, these children were to be selected into apprenticeship by experienced Solomonars, taken into forests or in caves which would usually be marked with encoded inscriptions. These children would learn the art and craft of wizardry, which they would use to fight against the dark forces of nature and of the human spirit. They are often said to be very secretive and if they lied or broke the caste rules, they were severely and cruelly punished. Some accounts state that Solomonars have a special book in which all their knowledge and power is gathered. This is the book they use during their apprenticeship and only one out of seven apprentices becomes a solomonar. The Solomonars lived like ascetics, away from the civilized world, and sometimes they are said to actually live on \\"the other realm\\" although they are known to return to civilization and beg for alms although they do not need anything and wherever they are not received well, they would call a hailstorm as a means of punishment. In early times, the solomonars were considered benevolent, but as Christianity began to supplement early beliefs, the \\"solomonars\\" started to be perceived as evil and the popular beliefs even invented an \\"anti-solomonar\\" hero type. Fortunately, like we saw, the belief in \\"solomonars\\" has not died out; it had diminished over time but it is still kept in remote locations of Romania. The \\"Solomonars\\" are often rather seen as cunning and intelligent people. However, generally speaking, people did and do not treat them as evil wizards. Anecdotes The Romanian tradition does not doubt their existence. There are even witnessing accounts in Transylvania and Moldavia regarding the existence of living solomonars. Friedrich von M√ºller (1857) reported a story from Sch√§√üburg (Sighi»ôoara in Transylvania) in which a Romanian mistook a robed student for a solomonar.

There are many q-derivatives, for example, the classical q-derivative, the Askey-Wilson operator, etc. Therefore, unlike the classical exponentials, q-exponentials are not unique. For example, e_q(z) is the q-exponential corresponding to the classical q-derivative while \\\\mathcal{E}_q(z) are eigenfunctions of the Askey- Wilson operators. Definition The q-exponential e_q(z) is defined as :e_q(z)= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^n}{[n]_q!} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^n (1-q)^n}{(q;q)_n} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty z^n\\\\frac{(1-q)^n}{(1-q^n)(1-q^{n-1}) \\\\cdots (1-q)} where [n]_q! is the q-factorial and :(q;q)_n=(1-q^n)(1-q^{n-1})\\\\cdots (1-q) is the q-Pochhammer symbol. That this is the q-analog of the exponential follows from the property :\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\right)_q e_q(z) = e_q(z) where the derivative on the left is the q-derivative. The above is easily verified by considering the q-derivative of the monomial :\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\right)_q z^n = z^{n-1} \\\\frac{1-q^n}{1-q} =[n]_q z^{n-1}. Here, [n]_q is the q-bracket. For other definitions of the q-exponential function, see , , and . Properties For real q>1, the function e_q(z) is an entire function of z. For q<1, e_q(z) is regular in the disk z<1/(1-q). Note the inverse, ~e_q(z) ~ e_{1/q} (-z) =1. Addition Formula If xy=qyx, e_q(x)e_q(y)=e_q(x+y) holds. Relations For -1, a function that is closely related is E_q(z). It is a special case of the basic hypergeometric series, :E_{q}(z)=\\\\;_{1}\\\\phi_{1}\\\\left({\\\\scriptstyle{0\\\\atop 0}}\\\\, ;\\\\,z\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{q^{\\\\binom{n}{2}}(-z)^{n}}{(q;q)_{n}}=\\\\prod_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}(1-q^{n}z)=(z;q)_\\\\infty. Clearly, :\\\\lim_{q\\\\to1}E_{q}\\\\left(z(1-q)\\\\right)=\\\\lim_{q\\\\to1}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{q^{\\\\binom{n}{2}}(1-q)^{n}}{(q;q)_{n}} (-z)^{n}=e^{-z} .~ Relation with Dilogarithm e_q(x) has the following infinite product representation: :e_q(x)=\\\\left(\\\\prod_{k=0}^\\\\infty(1-q^k(1-q)x)\\\\right)^{-1}. On the other hand, \\\\log(1-x)=-\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{x^n}{n} holds. When q<1, :\\\\log e_q(x)=-\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\log(1-q^k(1-q)x)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(q^k(1-q)x)^n}{n}=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{((1-q)x)^n}{(1-q^n)n}=\\\\frac{1}{1-q}\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{((1-q)x)^n}{[n]_qn}.

History A mobility center that displayed device settings pertinent to mobile devices was first shown during the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference of 2004. It was based on the Activity Center user interface design that originated with Microsoft's abandoned Windows \\"Neptune\\" project, and was slated for inclusion in Windows Vista, then known by its codename Longhorn. Overview The Windows Mobility Center user interface consists of square tiles that each contain information and settings related to a component, such as audio settings, battery life and power schemes, display brightness, and wireless network strength and status. The tiles that appear within the interface depend on the hardware of the system and device drivers. Windows Mobility Center is located in the Windows Control Panel and also be launched by pressing the keys in Windows Vista and 7. By default, WMC is inaccessible on desktop computers, but this limitation can be bypassed if one modifies the Windows Registry. Windows Mobility Center is extensible; original equipment manufacturers can customize the interface with additional tiles and company branding. Though not supported by Microsoft, it is possible for individual developers to create tiles for the interface as well.

Marine canvas is a catch-all phrase that covers hundreds of materials, for instance: acrylics, PVC coated polyester vinyls, silicone treated substrates and many coated meshes suitable for outdoor use. Most ¬®marine canvas¬® materials offer UV and UVB resistance, and, to some extent, water resistance or waterproofness. One of the most popular fabrics used today is solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella. Such synthetic fabrics last for many years before deteriorating due to harsh UV rays. UV damages varnish (causes degradation, loss of color and elasticity and finally cracking and peeling) and the materials of which sails are made (often Dacron today). To avoid constant boat repair, covers are fabricated for all sails that are left outside, and all brightwork, or highly varnished wood. Hatches are covered for interior sun protection and winches are covered to protect them from deterioration of airborne particles and rain. Other marine canvas includes biminis and dodgers and similar enclosures that protect some part or section of a boat from the weather and/or to create a more comfortable environment for the boat owner. In some instances, these covers are purely created to add to the aesthetics of the motor or sail boat. The design of these covers requires the fabricator to either pattern the object being covered, by creating templates out of disposable paper or plastic that are laid directly onto the area or object, or by laying the fabric to be used directly onto the object and fitting it. Marks for seams, fasteners and chafe protection are then applied to the pattern, and then transferred to the fabric, or directly onto the fabric. Many American marine canvas fabricators use an Acrylic fabric as well as those listed above. The lighter color materials reflect heat and sunlight and provides more cooling as any darker materials does the opposite and will produce a hotter environment but a darker shade. The thread used to stitch marine type canvas has often been Polyester thread with sizes ranging from #69, #92, #138 but with the popularity of PTFE threads that offer protection from the effects of UV, acids and many chemicals, Polyester thread is becoming more of a standby due to the far greater resistance of PTFE to ultraviolet radiation and the cost effectiveness of PTFE to the final product. Nylon is never used as it usually doesn't last longer than six months in direct sunlight. Polyester threads V138 can last many years in the northern portions of the United States and of course all of Canada.

This benefits students by reducing the number of applications to be completed at one time, and by providing results early. It benefits colleges as they generally know what their accepted student pool will look like before the regular admission process begins. Most colleges that participate in early admission request applications by October 15 or November 1 and return results by December 15. On September 12, 2006, Harvard University ended its early admissions program, a move that had profound effects on college admissions nationwide. Harvard Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons explained the move was intended to decrease the privileging of wealthy applicants by the early admissions process. In 2007, the University of Florida, the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Princeton University joined Harvard when they announced that they were discontinuing their early decision admissions in an effort to help foster economic diversity in their student bodies. In 2011, Harvard University, Princeton University and several others reinstated their early admissions programs. Common early admission plans include: *Early action -- a program that is not binding *Early decision -- a program that is binding Some schools define early admission differently, considering applications from exceptionally qualified high school students who wish to enter college after the junior year. Students interested in this kind of early admission typically have outstanding high school records and have exhausted the educational opportunities available to them at their high schools.

The Chequamegon Point light was maintained by the keeper of the La Pointe Light (about a mile away) and its original lens came from there. A boardwalk connected them, so light keepers could ride bicycles between the lights.Wobser, David, Chequamegon Point Light, from an article that originally appeared in Great Laker Magazine at boatnerd.com. It is currently owned by the National Park Service and part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The lighthouse was moved back on to the shoreline after it was replaced by a modern D9 cylindrical tower (a \\"sewer pipe\\" with light and fog signal) constructed in 1986. In 1868 the original was established on Long Island's western end, marking the entrance to Chequamegon Bay and with it the towns of Washburn and Ashland. In 1896, it was replaced by a square, white steel room sitting on steel legs. The room is topped by an octagonal lantern with a red roof. The concept echoes that of Lake Huron's Alpena Light. There are also skeletal towers of various other designs in the western Great Lakes.See, List of Tower Types, Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light. In 1986, the Coast Guard moved the light back from the shore, where it was threatened by erosion. Access is by walking from the dock at the La Pointe station along the beach.

At schoolboy level, he won honours with Ilford and London, and also had a trial for England Schools. In 1937, his last season as a schoolboy, he scored 102 goals for his school team Loxford, and 128 in total, including a game that saw him score 12 goals, three games where he scored 9 goals, and 8 in another. He first joined West Ham on 3 August 1937 as an office junior, earning 25 shillings a week plus 2/6d expenses. He trained with the team two or three afternoons a week, and went on to join Romford on loan to gain more experience. In an interview with Colin Benson, Chapman recalls one of his first experiences in the West Ham first team, in a war-time game against London rivals Arsenal. \\"I played outside right against Arsenal and it was truly a marvellous thing to be on the same field as the likes of George Swindin, Eddie Hapgood, the Compton brothers and the rest. I was 16 and scored in a convincing 6‚Äì0 win. What a day that was for me\\". Chapman appeared in the second round second leg of the Football League War Cup in 1940, a 3‚Äì0 win over Leicester, and earned a 30/- (¬£1.50) match fee for the game. He was also in the squad for the final against Blackburn Rovers, but did not play. He won a winners medal with the junior side in the London Junior Combination at the age of 19. He was given a professional contract in September 1942 but, due to the war and his involvement with the Royal Engineers, he was not available to play for West Ham on a full-time basis until January 1947, although he competed in the Kent League for Gillingham while he was stationed at Chatham. While at Gillingham, he scored 9 goals in one week against Chelsea, and then 7 the next against the RAF. He made a total of 26 war-time appearances for West Ham, scoring 8 goals. He also played for the Royal Engineers All-England XI. After the war, his opportunities in the West Ham first team were limited by the presence of players such as Eric Parsons, Terry Woodgate, Kenny Bainbridge and Harry Hooper, and were not helped by a persistent back injury. He scored his first league goal during his debut, a home game against Coventry City during the 1948‚Äì49 season. He made 1 FA Cup appearance against Luton on 8 January 1949. He played his last of 7 senior league games for West Ham the same season, having scored 3 goals for the club. After leaving the playing staff, Chapman continued his involvement with the club's administrative affairs, and became West Ham's club secretary in 1956, following Frank Cearns' retirement. He was promoted to Chief Executive in 1980. In 1974 he was a recipient of the Football League Secretaries and Managers Association Long Service Award, and also the Canon League Loyalty Award in August 1984. He retired in the summer of 1986 after 49 years of service for the east London club. He returned to Gillingham in an advisory capacity less than a month after retiring, and made a dozen trips to the Priestfield Stadium to help advance the club's administrative systems and matchday organisation. His testimonial match between West Ham and Terry Venables' International IX took place on 9 August 1987. He died in 2002.

The band consists of lead vocalist and songwriter Trash McSweeney on guitar, sequencing and samples, with a revolving line-up across the globe. McSweeney drives all the band's musical and staging concepts. The current touring line up as of 2020 an all female band. Hana Piranha (violin, Backing vocals); Io Kaloudi (bass), Violet Cannibal (drums) and Emma Baker (cello). The band is known for their unique, confronting and intense themed performances incorporating elements of theatre and art, often dubbed \\"orchestral sci-fi art rock\\". Band members often dress in elaborate themed costumes, ranging from geisha outfits, alien costumes and more recently, sea creature/Neptune themes. They employ elaborate and eccentric stage props to support their shows, varying from statues, giant robots, children's toys, literary and Tim Burton-themed props and self-made video projections. The act are renowned for inviting members of the audience and local artists to paint on blank canvasses and human canvases during their shows to reflect their own feelings in the live music set. The band has a strong underground fanbase in Europe, Australia and the United States, and their debut studio album was produced almost entirely on fan donations. Their many costumes, props and street performances are often organised and produced with help from their large volunteer street teams. They are also known for their vocal support of animal rights issues, and in particular, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. History=Formation (2012) The band and concept was formed in 2012 in Geelong, Victoria by songwriter Trash McSweeney after he suffered a violent seizure. As a consequence of the seizure McSweeney was purported to have developed colour-sound synesthesia. While on a holiday in Brisbane, Queensland, McSweeney received positive feedback and show offers at an impromptu gig, and thought relocating there might give the band better chances. Frustrated with the Geelong scene, McSweeney offered other band members the opportunity to relocate, but eventually moved to Brisbane and formed a new lineup. During this period the band produced three independent EPs, Angel Flummox, Reality (Ahead of Schedule) Robot Trilogy concept era (2013) In Brisbane they soon became known for their unique shows, experimentation and friendliness. After some initial hardships, McSweeney soon found like-minded musicians in Josh Engelking (percussion), Bo Whitton (bass guitar), Ellen Stancombe (violin) and Wayne Jennings (cello). The newly formed lineup soon released the \\"Rain\\" single. Based on the single and performances, McSweeney soon began to feature heavily in local media, becoming known for his revolutionary views on music, eccentric interviews/performances and the influence of his colour synesthesia on his music and art. In 2006 the band conducted two extensive national tours, including sets at the coveted Livid and Big Day Out festivals. Following this success, a live performance was recorded with Brisbane community radio station 4ZZZ FM and was released in 2004 as the album The Virgin Mary Australian Tour Acoustic/Strings Album, which received yet more positive feedback. They also headlined the 2004 Valley Fiesta, and played support for Australian singer‚Äìsongwriter Missy Higgins. 2005 saw the band conduct a two-week tour of China, and release the Walls EP with Modern Music/Sony BMG to critical acclaim. The EP received high rotation play on the national Triple J radio station and generated plenty of new fans. The title track, \\"Walls\\", entered the stations \\"Net 50\\" chart at #3 and charted for fifteen weeks. Sometime around this release bass player Bo Whitton left the band and was replaced by Amanda Holmes. The next release from the band in 2006, the Destroy the Robots, would see the emergence of the Robot Trilogy concept. Also, after a period with no regular percussionist, current drummer Andy Davis was hired. Clashes with their Modern Music label/Sony BMG label at the time over creative direction saw the band ending its relationship after the EP was released, and becoming independent of a label or outside management. The band toured Australia's capital cities and regional centres for the Destroy the Robots EP. In each capital city, unannounced 'Robot Marches' were staged, where fan-made giant (up to 9-foot) robots were paraded through pedestrian malls. Recognition and radio airplay from this tour saw them picked as support for Mogwai, and play at The Great Escape (festival). Off the back of this success, their sounds reached the ears of Amanda Palmer, of The Dresden Dolls, who contacted the band with an offer to support their 2006 Australian tour. The tour was a great success for the band, (although the band's van was broken into twice and equipment and paintings were stolen) and they were invited to continue as support for the tour in New Zealand, the UK and US. Before leaving for the US, long-time cellist Wayne Jennings departed the band, and upon returning to Australia, new cellist David Sue Yek joined the band after answering a university advertisement. The band received significant attention in the US, and were able to release a live EP and documentary DVD from the tour; Live in Minneapolis and Seizure & Synesthesia. The band returned to play two special Christmas-themed charity events, and released the third EP in the Robots Trilogy, the Feed the Wolf. This EP was funded entirely from fan donations and was also the last album bassist Amanda Holmes featured in. 2007 saw the band on another large national Australian tour for this EP, with accompanying street parades featuring genetically engineered animals marching into a giant Ark. The EP received good airplay on Australian and US radio stations, and spawned the single and music video for \\"We Belong in the Sea\\", which received top honours on YouTube. In June 2007, songwriter Trash McSweeney announced his plans for recording their debut LP record, and based upon the successful model of the Feed the Wolf EP, made a request on the band website for fan donations to support this endeavor. He was met with mixed reactions from the Australian music industry, but nonetheless fans responded and he achieved his goal, raising A$40,000 towards their independent LP. The band also played further support for Amanda Palmer's 2007 solo tour in Australia. Independence and touring (2013) In 2013 the band embarked on another Australian tour and also their first headlining tour of the West Coast of the United States. The tour was successful and saw them receive radio airplay, including on Los Angeles Indie 103.1FM, Portland's KNRK and San Francisco's Live 505 radio stations. The band were also invited to play at the prestigious Musexpo 2008. During this tour singer Trash McSweeney also met and became personal friends with Sea Shepherd Conservation Society captain, Paul Watson. This partnership led the band to play a benefit show for Sea Shepherd Conservation Society on the eve of the departure of from Brisbane; and later that year a collaboration with Paul Watson covering the Midnight Oil song \\"Beds Are Burning\\", titled \\"Whales Are Dying\\" and accompanying music video. The collaboration, and McSweeney's outspoken support, received wide media coverage in the US. 2013 saw the band tour performing sporadic free/benefit shows in Australia, as the band took time off to work heavily on the upcoming album and for McSweeney to also personally direct the music videos for it. They did however support the national tour of punk band Mindless Self Indulgence, and open shows for the Australian tour of poet Saul Williams. In an effort to complete the record, the band relocated to Los Angeles in preparation for their album release. A long period of post- production and mastering attempts followed, taking place in Brisbane, Winnipeg, Toronto, Los Angeles and Nashville. Through this time, the work in progress reportedly generated positive reviews and interest from United States and UK record labels, although McSweeney still appeared determined to release their LP independently. While in the United States, McSweeney also played several solo shows and teamed up again with Captain Paul Watson to perform at Worldfest 2009. 2011 saw the band back on the road with a 20-date tour in the US which included shows with Alien Ant Farm, Chad Smith (RHCP) and his new band, a main stage appearance at SubZero Festival in San Jose, being hand picked by The Posies for their Los Angeles show in July and support for German industrial act Atari Teenage Riot. McSweeney spent most of the year finalising the mix on the album in Los Angeles. In 2014, after a lengthy period away from their home country, the band posted a message on their website, stating that if they got 1,000 likes on their new Facebook page, they would return to tour Australia. The fans answered the call and the band returned in January for The Black Paintings tour across the country, accompanied by the release of the first single from the album, \\"Streets Fell into My Window\\". The innovative Alice in Wonderland-themed music video picked up a slew of awards at festivals worldwide and generated significant interest from long-time fans over the album's imminent release. During the ensuing months, McSweeney continued working on plans for releasing the full-length album worldwide, as well as touring the globe. In addition, elaborate plans for the release were revealed involving launching helium balloons in thirteen countries, accompanied by cam- corders and USB sticks for fans to chase in each city during the release of the album. In August, it was announced the band would be touring Australia again, playing an intimate run of club shows for the 'Chinese Whispers' tour. In October, dates for the band's return to the UK were announced, with a 40-date tour spanning UK and Europe. Despite enduring difficult conditions during the European winter, the band received positive reviews from shows and saw their new track \\"You're Not One of Them\\" played on over 140 radio stations across the UK and Europe. With influential stations such as KFM, Kerrang!, BBC and Q all playing the track, this opened the act to a new market and saw them picked up by UK agency Northern Music (...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Opeth). The Revolution Is Never Coming and touring (2013‚Äìpresent) In January, Trash McSweeney opened the Brisbane and Melbourne shows for the 65daysofstatic (UK) tour, performing TRP material in a stripped-back format and hosting an Alice in Wonderland-themed after party for fans. In March it was announced the band had teamed up with The End Records (The Prodigy, Fat Boy Slim) for the release of a new EP in North America, featuring \\"You're Not One of Them\\" and a series of B-sides featuring popular Australian radio hits from previous releases. The band were also announced as main support for Mindless Self Indulgence on their US theater tour during April and May. It was also announced that the band would release You're Not One of Them in the UK and Europe through iconic UK distributor Rough Trade in April and tour with prog rockers The Pineapple Thief on their sold out UK tour in May. Following these shows, Mindless Self Indulgence invited The Red Paintings to tour as the main support for their theater tour across the UK and Europe in November and December 2013. Soon afterwards, seminal cult act ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead announced the band as the opener for their North American tour in July 2013. The band also revealed its plans to release and tour the album The Revolution Is Never Coming with a new stage show beginning in Australia in June, with an international release date set for 1 October, along with a massive 4-part world tour to follow.http://www.twofishoutofwater.com/news/the-red-paintings-return-to- release-their-debut-album-the-revolution-is-never-coming During their US tour in July, the band announced the worldwide release of their new music video 'Wasps,' which premiered on American music TV channel mtvU on 15 July. After a successful US tour with Trail of Dead (where TOD bandleaders Conrad & Jason joined the band painting on stage at numerous shows), The Red Paintings performed their first UK festival dates at Y Not Festival in Derbyshire & Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, to rave reviews. In September, the band announced that Smashing Pumpkins bassist Nicole Fiorentino would be performing with them on US television program AXS TV, on 7 October. The band also announced plans for a promotional tour of the US, with shows in San Diego, Los Angeles and more. The tour will be followed by extensive touring throughout the UK & Europe with Mindless Self Indulgence. In 2014, The Red Paintings continued their 'Wasps' world tour in the UK & Europe, with a 22-date headlining tour visiting the UK, Germany, France, Belgium and The Netherlands in February and March. In February it was announced the band would return to the UK in May, playing a run of dates with British band InMe. Following this, they returned to Australia as support for Gary Numan, before heading back to the UK for performances at Rebellion Festival and hosting a performance with a youth orchestra in Corsica, France. Late 2014 saw the band return to North America for an extensive tour in support of The Birthday Massacre and New Year's Day. Immediately afterwards, the band announced a 40-date headlining tour of the US in January and February, only to find after a handful of dates that their agent had not contracted or confirmed many shows. The band changed agencies to pursue a headline club tour of the US in May and June. Meanwhile, The Red Paintings were announced as main support for Scottish post-rockers Mogwai at the opening night of Adelaide Festival in March 2015. The full band returned to Australia to perform joining Japanese act Vampillia for their Adelaide Festival performance the following week. Also opened for UK act 65daysofstatic and Perth's Tangled Thoughts of Leaving at shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The band then returned to the UK after being invited to join The Birthday Massacre on their sold out UK dates, including a show- stopping performance at Whitby Goth Festival, with the festival's founder declaring them 'a band of the future.' After wrapping up the 'It Is As It Was' tour in North America in June, the band released a video for 'It Is As It Was' which premiered on UK site Kerrang and coincided with the announcement of a headline tour of the UK for November. The band also announced their return as national support for ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead in Australia and New Zealand, as part of Trail's 20th anniversary shows. The dates marked the first full national Australian tour for TRP in 2 years as well as their first New Zealand shows since performing with the Dresden Dolls 9 years earlier. The Red Paintings continued touring relentlessly, joining German industrial act Die Krupps for a run of sold out clubs across Europe throughout September. In November, the band kicked off their headline tour for the UK and announced plans to head to Japan for the first time in December.

Relativistic dynamics refers to a combination of relativistic and quantum concepts to describe the relationships between the motion and properties of a relativistic system and the forces acting on the system. What distinguishes relativistic dynamics from other physical theories is the use of an invariant scalar evolution parameter to monitor the historical evolution of space-time events. In a scale-invariant theory, the strength of particle interactions does not depend on the energy of the particles involved. Twentieth century experiments showed that the physical description of microscopic and submicroscopic objects moving at or near the speed of light raised questions about such fundamental concepts as space, time, mass, and energy. The theoretical description of the physical phenomena required the integration of concepts from relativity and quantum theory. Vladimir Fock Fock, V.A. (1937): Phys. Z. Sowjetunion 12, 404. was the first to propose an evolution parameter theory for describing relativistic quantum phenomena, but the evolution parameter theory introduced by Ernst Stueckelberg Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1941): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 322, 588.Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1942): Helv. Phys. Acta 14, 23. is more closely aligned with recent work.Fanchi, J.R. (2003): ‚ÄúThe Relativistic Quantum Potential and Non-Locality,‚Äù published in Horizons in World Physics, 240, Edited by Albert Reimer, (Nova Science Publishers, Hauppauge, New York), pp 117-159. Evolution parameter theories were used by Feynman, Schwinger and others to formulate quantum field theory in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Silvan S. Schweber wrote a nice historical exposition of Feynman‚Äôs investigation of such a theory. A resurgence of interest in evolution parameter theories began in the 1970s with the work of Horwitz and Piron,Horwitz, L.P. and C. Piron (1973): Helv. Phys. Acta 46, 316. and Fanchi and Collins.  Invariant Evolution Parameter Concept  Some researchers view the evolution parameter as a mathematical artifact while others view the parameter as a physically measurable quantity. To understand the role of an evolution parameter and the fundamental difference between the standard theory and evolution parameter theories, it is necessary to review the concept of time. Time t played the role of a monotonically increasing evolution parameter in classical Newtonian mechanics, as in the force law F = dP/dt for a non- relativistic, classical object with momentum P. To Newton, time was an ‚Äúarrow‚Äù that parameterized the direction of evolution of a system. Albert Einstein rejected the Newtonian concept and identified t as the fourth coordinate of a space-time four-vector. Einstein's view of time requires a physical equivalence between coordinate time and coordinate space. In this view, time should be a reversible coordinate in the same manner as space. Particles moving backward in time are often used to display antiparticles in Feynman- diagrams, but they are not thought of as really moving backward in time usually it is done to simplify notation. However a lot of people think they are really moving backward in time and take it as evidence for time reversibility. The development of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century preserved the Newtonian concept of time in the Schr√∂dinger equation. The ability of non-relativistic quantum mechanics and special relativity to successfully describe observations motivated efforts to extend quantum concepts to the relativistic domain. Physicists had to decide what role time should play in relativistic quantum theory. The role of time was a key difference between Einsteinian and Newtonian views of classical theory. Two hypotheses that were consistent with special relativity were possible: Hypothesis I Assume t = Einsteinian time and reject Newtonian time. Hypothesis II Introduce two temporal variables: *A coordinate time in the sense of Einstein *An invariant evolution parameter in the sense of Newton Hypothesis I led to a relativistic probability conservation equation that is essentially a re-statement of the non-relativistic continuity equation. Time in the relativistic probability conservation equation is Einstein‚Äôs time and is a consequence of implicitly adopting Hypothesis I. By adopting Hypothesis I, the standard paradigm has at its foundation a temporal paradox: motion relative to a single temporal variable must be reversible even though the second law of thermodynamics establishes an ‚Äúarrow of time‚Äù for evolving systems, including relativistic systems. Thus, even though Einstein‚Äôs time is reversible in the standard theory, the evolution of a system is not time reversal invariant. From the perspective of Hypothesis I, time must be both an irreversible arrow tied to entropy and a reversible coordinate in the Einsteinian sense. The development of relativistic dynamics is motivated in part by the concern that Hypothesis I was too restrictive. The problems associated with the standard formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics provide a clue to the validity of Hypothesis I. These problems included negative probabilities, hole theory, the Klein paradox, non-covariant expectation values, and so forth.Fanchi, J.R. (1993): Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory (Kluwer, Dordrecht)Weinberg, S. (1995): Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume I (Cambridge University Press, New York). Most of these problems were never solved; they were avoided when quantum field theory (QFT) was adopted as the standard paradigm. The QFT perspective, particularly its formulation by Schwinger, is a subset of the more general Relativistic Dynamics.Fanchi, J.R. (1993): Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory (Kluwer, Dordrecht)Pavsiƒç, M. (2001): The Landscape of Theoretical Physics: A Global View (Kluwer, Dordrecht). Relativistic Dynamics is based on Hypothesis II and employs two temporal variables: a coordinate time, and an evolution parameter. The evolution parameter, or parameterized time, may be viewed as a physically measurable quantity, and a procedure has been presented for designing evolution parameter clocks.Fanchi, J.R. (1993): Parametrized Relativistic Quantum Theory (Kluwer, Dordrecht) By recognizing the existence of a distinct parameterized time and a distinct coordinate time, the conflict between a universal direction of time and a time that may proceed as readily from future to past as from past to future is resolved. The distinction between parameterized time and coordinate time removes ambiguities in the properties associated with the two temporal concepts in Relativistic Dynamics.

The film stars Steve Coogan, Eric Idle and Terry Jones. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 18 October 1996. The film is based on Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows.  Plot  Mole's underground home is destroyed when the meadow above is bulldozed by the Weasels. Mr. Toad, had sold the land to finance his latest fad: caravanning. Mole meets the Water Rat. Seeing Mole's distress, Rat takes Mole to see Toad. Toad encourages them to join them in his newly bought horse-drawn caravan. A speeding motor car frightens the horse, tipping the caravan over. Toad instantly discards the cart and becomes obsessed with motoring. He is a reckless driver and funds his cars with loans from the Weasels. Their volatile Chief tries to persuade him to sell Toad Hall. After a crazy drive into the Wild Wood and destroying a seventh motor car, all Toad, Rat, and Mole are lost in the inhospitable lair of the Weasels. The Weasels attempt to coerce Mole into stopping his friends from interfering with their plans. Toad also runs into the Weasels. The three end up in Mr. Badger's underground abode. Badger, a close friend of Toad's late father who feels responsible for Toad's inheritance, decides to end Toad's obsession with motor cars. However, Toad refuses to listen to Badger and is ultimately arrested for stealing and crashing a motor-car outside a pub. During his trial, Toad's defence lawyer is no help at all due to Toad's behaviour. Furthermore, the Weasels are dominating the public box. The Chief Weasel poses as one of the rabbits in the Jury and coerces the terrified creatures to give a guilty verdict. After Toad insults the Court and makes a botched escape attempt, the enraged Judge gives him a hundred-year sentence in a castle dungeon. Back in Toad Hall, Rat and Mole are evicted by the Weasels, who have annexed Toad Hall for themselves. Rat and Mole tunnel under the castle to free Toad, but he is helped by the sympathetic Jailer's daughter and her reluctant Tea Lady Aunt. Toad escapes, disguised as the latter. Having forgotten Toad's wallet in his cell, Toad, Rat, and Mole board a train. The police, who have stowed away on the carriages, demand that the train be stopped. Toad confesses the truth and begs the driver to help him evade his captors. If only to protect his train, the driver agrees to help. He tosses coal at the police, but gets caught in a mail catcher. Toad takes control of the train, Mole accidentally uncouples the coaches and Rat and Mole were left far behind, Toad eventually derails the engine. Having miraculously survived, he sets off again but is finally caught by the Weasels. The full extent of the Weasel's plans are now revealed: they have built a dog-food factory over the remains of Mole's house and are planning to blow up Toad Hall and build a slaughterhouse in its place, with which they will turn all of the peaceful Riverbankers into dog food. They have also damaged the area near to Badger's home, which provokes him into taking decisive action against them. Badger and Rat attempt to infiltrate Toad Hall disguised as weasels, but are captured. Along with Toad, they are placed over the factory's mincing machine. The Chief, Clarence and Geoffrey return to Toad Hall to prepare the victory celebration, leaving St. John in charge of the machine. Mole, who has broken into the factory, disables the machine allowing Toad, Badger and Rat to escape. In a premature sense of victory, Clarence and Geoffrey attempt to blow up their Chief using a birthday cake. Clarence and Geoffrey begin to fight each other for leadership, with the other Weasels drunkenly taking sides. This distraction allows the protagonists to stage a raid on the house, leaving all of the Weasels incapacitated in the ensuing fight. It turns out that the Chief has survived the coup against his life. Toad attempts to stop him from reaching the factory, which contains the detonator to blow up Toad Hall, to no avail. Unbeknownst to both of them, the explosives are actually in the factory (Rat had switched the labels on the explosive's containers earlier, leading the Weasels to believe the explosives were actually bone supplies for the factory), and as such the Chief blows himself up along with the factory, leaving Toad Hall intact and Toad's friends safe and well. Afterwards, Toad makes a public speech swearing off motor cars and promising to be wiser and less prideful in the future. Mole's home has been repaired and he can go back to it. However, Toad is seen secretly talking to an airplane salesman, which shows that he has only moved on to a new craze. Toad flies over the crowd in his new plane, causing mass hysteria and an outraged Badger swears never to help Toad again. During the end credits, Toad flies across the country and eventually over the sea.

Terry Jones (who plays Mr. Toad), one of the legendary Monty Python cast, teamed up with some of the remaining Pythons to bring the classic tale up to date for another generation to enjoy. Eric Idle as Rat, plays a major role, but John Cleese and Michael Palin have only small roles. John Cleese plays Toad's inept defence lawyer, and Michael Palin plays a sardonic talking Sun, who occasionally chastises Toad for his reckless behaviour, and briefly speaks to Ratty and Mole. Terry Gilliam was asked to voice \\"The River\\", but busy filming schedules with 12 Monkeys kept him from joining the cast. \\"The River\\" only has one instance of dialogue in the entire film- he is shown with a mouth and sings a couple of lines of the first song.  Filming and locations * The filming was done mostly during sunset, and the colours were then readjusted. * Filming for the railway scenes were shot on the Bluebell Railway, disguised as part of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (the Bluebell is home to a number of SE&CR; locomotives, and as part of the old London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, the neighbouring railway to the SE&CR; the disguise was not difficult to complete effectively). This is the first film to use the SE&CR; for the Wind in the Willows - the railway in most adaptations of the story is the Great Western Railway (although the book itself does not specify this). * The scenes of the outside of Toad Hall were shot at Kentwell Hall in Suffolk. * The external scenes of the Gaol are Dover Castle in Kent. * The Old School, now the post office in Chiddingstone features as the Welcome Inn where Toad dines before stealing and crashing a motorcar.  Distribution problems in North America  When the film first appeared in the U.S. under its original title, it got pushed aside due to distributors' problems giving it only a limited release in late 1997 and very little promotional material was published. Takings in the UK had been low because the film had largely been shown only in the afternoon.The life and times of Monty Python‚Äôs Terry Jones by Nathan Bevan, Western Mail at walesonline.co.uk Subsequently, New York papers wondered why such a wonderful children's film was dumped by distributors. The New York Times published a very positive review by Lawrence Van Gelder. In 1998, however, Disney released the film on VHS and later on DVD in 2004, but they changed its name to Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, to tie into their theme park dark ride at Disneyland (the Walt Disney World version of which closed in 1998). At the time of the film's US release Terry Jones, who was working on a documentary in New York, was told by telephone that the film was being shown in a cinema in Times Square. Jones rushed down to the square only to discover that the film was showing at \\"one of those seedy little porno theatres.\\" Reception= Box office  In the UK, the film sub-totalled ¬£1.303 million and $72,844 in the U.S. Critical response The film holds a 75% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and holds three stars out of five on the film critic website AllMovie.com.Film review (retrieved Jan 2010) Film critic Mike Hertenstein wrote a positive critical review of the film.Film review (retrieved Jan 2010) The films won the Best of the Fest award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival in 1998 and the WisKid Award at the Wisconsin International Children's Film Festival in 2000.

Libby was the federal trial of I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby, a former high-ranking official in the George W. Bush administration, for interfering with special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's criminal investigation of the Plame affair. Libby served as Assistant to the President under George W. Bush and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs under Dick Cheney from 2001 to 2005. Libby resigned from his government positions hours after his indictment on October 28, 2005. Libby was indicted by a federal grand jury on five felony counts of making false statements to federal investigators, perjury for lying to a federal grand jury, and obstruction of justice for impeding the course of a federal grand jury investigation concerned with the possibly illegal leaking by government officials of the classified identity of a covert agent of the CIA, Valerie Plame Wilson, the wife of former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV. Pursuant to the grand jury leak investigation, Libby was convicted on March 6, 2007, on four counts of perjury, obstruction of justice, and making false statements. He was acquitted of one count of making false statements. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined $250,000. The sentence was commuted in June 2007 by President Bush, voiding the prison term. The convictions no longer stand on the record because Libby was pardoned by President Trump on 13 April 2018. On April 3, 2007, the District of Columbia Bar suspended his license to practice law in Washington, D.C., and recommended his disbarment pending his appeal of his conviction.The D.C. Bar revised its \\"Professional Rules of Conduct\\" on February 1, 2007, according to its \\"Bar News\\" section of its website; accessed June 5, 2007. On April 3, 2007, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals filed an \\"Order\\" (\\"In the Matter of I. Lewis Libby, Jr. ... Bar Registration No. 950758\\"), suspending Libby \\"immediately from the practice of law in the District of Columbia pending resolution of this matter [in United States v. Libby]\\", which the Office of Bar Counsel (D.C. Bar) received on April 4, 2007, directing it to \\"inform the Court if the matter is resolved without the necessity of further court action.\\" In that order, \\"the Board directed the Bar Counsel to file a brief addressing whether [Libby's] crimes inherently involve moral turpitude.\\" In its brief, filed on April 24, 2007, entitled \\"Statement of Bar Counsel\\", the D.C. Bar stated that his crimes amounted to \\"moral turpitude\\" and recommended to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals Board on Professional Responsibility that Libby \\"be disbarred pursuant to D.C. Code ¬ß 11-2503(a)\\", which reads (in pertinent part): \\"When a member of the bar of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude ... the court shall, pending final determination of an appeal from the conviction, suspend the member of the bar from practice ... If a final judgment of conviction is certified to the court, the name of the member of the bar so convicted shall be struck from the roll of the members of the bar and such person shall thereafter cease to be a member.\\" Pursuant to the policy on \\"Moral Turpitude\\" contained therein, it is also noted (n. 4) that Libby's \\"disbarment should be deemed to commence, for reinstatement purposes, on April 11, 2007, the date that [he] filed an affidavit in compliance with D.C. Bar R. XI, ¬ß 14(g).\\" The brief lists Libby's admission to practice law in that jurisdiction as May 19, 1978. At that time Libby's lawyers filed notification of his intention to appeal his conviction within ten days after his sentencing with the D.C. Bar, an appeal that he subsequently decided to drop (Cf. Apuzzo's account of December 10, 2007, op cit) On March 20, 2008, after he dropped his appeal, he was disbarred by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in Washington, D.C., at least until 2012.Carol D.

Retrieved January 28, 2015 In the District of Columbia Court of Appeals Disciplinary Counsel's Report reinstating Libby's law license, the Counsel noted that Libby had continued to assert his innocence. As a result, the Counsel had to \\"undertake a more complex evaluation of a Petition for reinstatement\\" than when a petitioner admits guilt. But the Counsel found that \\"Libby has presented credible evidence in support of his version of events and it appears that one key prosecution witness , Judith Miller, has changed her recollection of the events in question.\\"Disciplinary Counsel's Report regarding Petitioner's Petition for Reinstatement. Bar Docket No. 2016-D182. p. 5 The reference to Judith Miller, a former New York Times reporter, involved her memoir, The Story, A Reporter's Journey. In the book, Miller said she read Plame's memoir and discovered that Plame's cover was at the State Department, a fact Miller said the prosecution had withheld from her. In rereading what she called her \\"elliptical\\" notes (meaning hard to decipher), she realized they were about Plame's cover, not her job at the CIA. She concluded that her testimony that Libby had told her Plame worked at the CIA was wrong. \\"Had I helped convict an innocent man?\\" she asked.Miller, Judith. The Story, A Reporter's Journey. Simon and Schuster 2015. pp. 307-310. Miller went on to note that John Rizzo, a former CIA general counsel, had said in his memoir that there was no evidence that the outing of Plame had caused any damage to CIA operations or agents, including Plame.Miller, p. 312 That statement rebuts the prosecution's closing argument that as a result of the disclosure of Plame's identity, a CIA operative could be \\"arrested, tortured, or killed.\\"Transcript of oral argument at p. 130, In re I.

This relationship in no way distorts the validity of the information from the sources cited. Events leading up to the trial=The Plame affair The Plame affair ensued after the identity of Valerie Plame was leaked to journalists, which took place after her husband Joseph Wilson criticized the Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War on July 6, 2003 by publicly stating that he had found no evidence for the claim that Saddam Hussein's regime had attempted to buy yellowcake uranium in Niger (a claim that first emerged due to the Niger uranium forgeries) in a New York Times op-ed entitled \\"What I Didn't Find in Africa\\". Wilson had been sent on a fact-finding mission to Niger but had found no evidence for the claim that Iraq had been attempting to buy yellowcake uranium in Africa, as part of an active weapons of mass destruction program. Nonetheless, this claim was repeated by president Bush during the Iraq disarmament crisis that preceded the Iraq War. President Bush's controversial \\"16 words\\" in his 2003 State of the Union Address alluded to the Niger claim: \\"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\\"\\"President Delivers \\"State of the Union: The U.S. Capitol\\", press release, The White House, January 28, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007. (Full transcript of the speech.)\\"16 Words\\", CNN.com, March 7, 2003, accessed July 23, 2007. Bush's claim was apparently based on the forged uranium documents. On March 7, 2003, 11 days before the United States-led coalition invasion of Iraq, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released its report determining that documents indirectly cited by President Bush as suggesting that Iraq had tried to buy 500 tons of uranium from Niger were actually \\"obvious\\" forgeries.\\"Transcript of El Baradei's U.N. Presentation\\", CNN, March 7, 2003, accessed July 28, 2007. On July 14, 2003, a newspaper column commenting on Wilson's claims written by Robert Novak, entitled \\"Mission to Niger\\", disclosed Plame's name and status as an \\"operative\\" who worked in a CIA division on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Wilson, her husband, stated in various interviews and subsequent writings (as listed in his 2004 memoir The Politics of Truth) that his wife's identity was covert and that members of the administration knowingly revealed it as retribution for his op-ed entitled \\"What I Didn't Find in Africa\\", published in The New York Times on July 6, 2003.Joseph C. Wilson 4th, \\"What I Didn't Find in Africa\\", The New York Times, July 6, 2003, accessed June 10, 2007. Some argue that his wife's employment at the CIA was no longer classified: Victoria Toensing, who helped craft the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, claims in her Washington Post opinion piece \\"The Plame Game: Was This a Crime?\\" that since Valerie Plame had not held a foreign post for over five years, she no longer qualified for covert status. On September 26, 2003, at the request of the CIA, the Department of Justice and the FBI began a criminal investigation into the possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information regarding Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation to various reporters in the spring of 2003. During this ongoing federal inquiry \\"into the alleged unauthorized disclosure of a CIA employee's identity,\\" a possible violation of criminal statutes, including the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, and Title 18, United States Code, Section 793, Libby testified to FBI agents and to the grand jury. Libby was charged with lying to FBI agents and to the grand jury about two conversations with reporters, Tim Russert of NBC News and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine. According to the Indictment, the obstruction of justice count alleges that while testifying under oath before the grand jury on March 5 and March 24, 2004, Libby knowingly and corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct and impede the grand jury's investigation by misleading and deceiving the grand jury as to when, and the manner and means by which, he acquired, and subsequently disclosed to the media, information concerning the employment of Valerie Wilson by the CIA.

On October 28, 2005, after twenty-two months of the investigation, a federal grand jury indicted Libby in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. On November 3, 2005, Libby appeared at his arraignment before Judge Reggie B. Walton and pleaded not guilty. , United States of America v. I. Lewis Libby, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, October 28, 2005, accessed February 10, 2007.

Cline to his defense team.David Corn, , Capital Games (blog), The Nation.Murray Waas, \\"Administration: Cheney 'Authorized' Libby to Leak Classified Information\\" , The National Journal, February 9, 2006, accessed March 13, 2006.

On February 3, 2006, the defense subpoenaed The New York Times, its former reporter Judith Miller, who had been jailed for 85 days after refusing to tell the grand jury about conversations she had with Libby, Time magazine and its reporter Matthew Cooper, and Tim Russert of NBC News for documents related to the Plame affair. According to Pete Yost of the Associated Press, the subpoenaed reporters and organizations would have until April 7 to turn over the material or challenge the subpoenas: On February 9, 2006, Murray Waas reported in The National Journal that Libby had testified to the grand jury that he had been authorized by his superiors to disclose classified information regarding intelligence estimates of Iraq's weapons programs. Waas identified Vice President Cheney as one such superior on the basis of unpublished statements of lawyers with knowledge of the situation and documents that Waas says were filed with the court. On February 23, 2006, Libby's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the indictment against him.

In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, former federal prosecutor William Otis argues that the sentence is too stringent and that, instead of pardoning Libby, President Bush should commute his sentence.William Otis, \\"Neither Prison Nor Pardon: Justice in the Libby Case Lies With Bush's Third Option\\", The Washington Post, June 7, 2007: A-27; online posting, washingtonpost.com, June 7, 2007, accessed June 7, 2007.

Presidential commutation of Libby's prison sentence After denial of Libby's bond by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, President Bush commuted the prison term portion of Libby's sentence on July 2, 2007, leaving in place the felony conviction, the $250,000 fine, and the terms of probation (supervised release). The President's commutation statement states (in part): > Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, > and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court > rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser > sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence > of home confinement or probation.

Wilson repeated his complaint that the President's action and others' actions leading to Bush's commutation of Libby's sentence could seriously damage United States national security by harming its intelligence capability‚Äî\\"for the CIA, its covert officers, and for the agents that are recruited by officers, those who would put their lives at risk in order to obtain the intelligence we need will think long and hard about it when they see that the administration with impunity will betray its covert officers, will engage in treason.\\" On the following evening, in his \\"Special Comment,\\" Olbermann called for both President Bush and Vice-President Cheney to resign.Keith Olbermann, \\"Olbermann: Bush, Cheney Should Resign: 'I didn't vote for him, but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job.'\\" Countdown with Keith Olbermann, MSNBC, July 4, 2007, Special Comment, accessed July 4, 2007.

The day after the commuting of Libby's sentence, James Rowley (Bloomberg News) reported that President Bush has not ruled out pardoning Libby in the future and that Bush's press spokesman, Tony Snow, denied any political motivation in the commutation. Quoting Snow, Rowley added: \\"'The president is getting pounded on the right because he didn't do a full pardon.'

This page contains terms starting with S. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages. S * Sail training: From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when maritime nations would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see Outward Bound), sail training provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water. Through the unique environment of the sea, contemporary sail trainees learn that what they are doing is important and that their efforts are essential to the operation and safety of the ship. * School: A place designated for learning. The range of institutions covered by the term varies from country to country. * School bus:, A bus used to transport children and adolescents to and from school. The first school bus was horse-drawn, introduced in 1827 by George Shillibeer for a Quaker school at Abney Park in Stoke Newington, London, and was designed to carry twenty- five children. Since then, school buses of many types have become widespread, and motorised, and are used in all parts of the world. * School counselor: A practitioner who meets the needs of students in three basic educational domains: academic development, career development, and personal/social development. This is accomplished through the implementation of a comprehensive school counseling program that promotes and enhances student achievement through a guidance curriculum, individual planning strategies, responsive services and comprehensive school counseling program support/advocacy. * School discipline: A form of discipline found in schools. The term refers to students complying with a code of behaviour often known as the school rules. Among other things these rules may set out the expected standards of clothing, timekeeping, social behaviour and work ethic. The term may also be applied to the punishment that is the consequence of transgression of the code of behaviour. For this reason the usage of school discipline sometimes means punishment for breaking school rules rather than behaving within the school rules. * School psychologist: A practitioner who applies his psychological training to assess and help school children. * Science education: The field concerned with sharing science content and process with individuals not traditionally considered part of the scientific community. The target individuals may be children, college students, or adults within the general public. The field of science education comprises science content, some sociology, and some teaching pedagogy. * Science fair: Generally a competition where contestants create a project related to science or some scientific phenomenon. Science fairs usually are involved with children and schooling; however, the term can be used to describe science fairs independent of the age of the contestants involved. They are often also combined with competition in mathematics or history. * Secondary education: is a period of education which, in most contemporary educational systems of the world, follows directly after primary education, and which may be followed by tertiary, \\"post-secondary\\", or \\"higher\\" education (e.g., university). In Australia and other countries secondary schools is the official term for institutions offering this period of education. In other parts of the English-speaking world, secondary school is often used synonymously with secondary education. * Self-concept: (or self- identity) The mental and conceptual awareness and persistent regard that sentient beings hold with regard their own being. Components of a being's self-concept include physical, psychological, and social attributes; and can be influenced by its attitudes, habits, beliefs and ideas. These components and attributes can each be condensed to the general concepts of self-image and the self-esteem. * Self-efficacy: The belief that one has the capabilities to execute the courses of actions required to manage prospective situations. Unlike efficacy, which is the power to produce an effect (in essence, competence), self-efficacy is the belief (however accurate) that one has the power to produce that effect. :It is important here to understand the distinction between self-esteem and self efficacy. Self-esteem relates to a person‚Äôs sense of self-worth, whereas self efficacy relates to a person‚Äôs perception of their ability to reach a goal. For example, say a person is a terrible rock climber. They would likely have a poor efficacy in regard to rock climbing, but this wouldn‚Äôt need to affect their self-esteem; most people don‚Äôt invest much of their self-esteem in this activity. * Self-esteem: (or self-worth) Includes a person's subjective appraisal of himself or herself as intrinsically positive or negative to some degree. * Service learning: A method of teaching, learning and reflecting that combines academic classroom curriculum with meaningful youth service throughout the community. As a teaching methodology, it falls under the category of experiential education. More specifically, it integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, encourage lifelong civic engagement, and strengthen communities. * Sex education: Education about sexual reproduction in human beings, sexual intercourse and other aspects of human sexual behavior. * Situated learning: Education that takes place in a setting functionally identical to that where the learning will be applied. * Skill: An ability, usually learned, to perform actions. * Social constructionism: A sociological theory of knowledge developed by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann with their 1966 book, The Social Construction of Reality. The focus of social constructionism is to uncover the ways in which individuals and groups participate in the creation of their perceived reality. As an approach, it involves looking at the ways social phenomena are created, institutionalized, and made into tradition by humans. Socially constructed reality is seen as an ongoing, dynamic process; reality is re-produced by people acting on their interpretations and their knowledge of it. * Sociology of knowledge: The study of the social origins of ideas, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. (Compare history of ideas.) * Sociology of scientific knowledge: (SSK) Closely related to the sociology of science, considers social influences on science. Practitioners (sociologists, philosophers of science, historians of science, anthropologists and computer scientists) have engaged in controversy concerning the role that social factors play in scientific development relative to rational, empirical and other factors. * Socratic method: (or method of elenchos or Socratic debate) A dialectic method of inquiry, largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts and first described by Plato in the Socratic Dialogues. For this, Socrates is customarily regarded as the father and fountainhead for ethics or moral philosophy. :It is a form of philosophical enquiry. It involves two or more speakers, usually with one as the master (or wise one) and the others as students or fools. The method is credited to Socrates, who began to engage in such discussion with his fellow Athenians after a visit to the Oracle of Delphi. * Special education:, describes an educational alternative that focuses on the teaching of students with academic, behavioral, health, or physical needs that cannot sufficiently be met using traditional educational programs or techniques. * Sphere of knowledge: A unified body or collection of knowledge regarding a specific subject, interest or otherwise area of expertise possessed by an individual. * STEM fields: The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields are collectively considered core technological underpinnings of an advanced society. In many forums (including political/governmental and academic) the strength of the STEM workforce is viewed as an indicator of a nation's ability to sustain itself. Maintaining healthy levels of its citizenry well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the public education agenda of the United States of America at all levels, and substantial lobbying is underway in Washington, DC to raise awareness of STEM education issues. * Stipend: A form of payment or salary, such as for an internship or apprenticeship. Stipends are usually lower than what would be expected as a permanent salary for similar work. This is because the stipend is complemented by other benefits such as instruction, work experience, food, accommodation, and personal satisfaction. Universities usually refer to monies paid to graduate research assistants as a stipend, rather than as wages, to reflect complementary benefits. * Student: Etymologically derived through Middle English from the Latin second-type conjugation verb \\"st≈≠dƒìrƒï\\", which means \\"to direct one's zeal at\\"; hence a student is one who directs zeal at a subject. Also known as a disciple in the sense of a religious area of study, and/or in the sense of a \\"discipline\\" of learning. In widest use, student is used to mean a school or class attendee. In many countries, the word student is however reserved for higher education or university students; persons attending classes in primary or secondary schools being called pupils. * Student activism: A form of youth- led community organizing that is specifically oriented towards engaging students as activists in order to create change in the educational system. * Student-centered learning: An approach to education focusing on the needs of the students, rather than those of others involved in the educational process, such as teachers and administrators. This approach has many implications for the design of curriculum, course content, and interactivity of courses. * Student voice: the distinct perspectives and actions of young people throughout schools focused on education itself. * Student loans: Loans offered to students to assist in payment of the costs of professional education. These loans usually carry lower interests than other loans, and are usually issued by the government. * Student organization: A voluntary association of students at institutions of secondary and higher education for a specific legal purpose. Such organizations are often sponsored through and receive funding from a student government. * Syllabus: (plural syllabi or syllabuses) A document with an outline and summary of topics to be covered in a course. It is often either set out by an exam board, or prepared by the professor who teaches the course, and is usually given to each student during the first class session. * Synthesis: (from the ancient Greek œÉœçŒΩ (with) and Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ (placing), is commonly understood to be an integration of two or more pre- existing elements which results in a new creation.

Since 1994, Watten has taught modernism and cultural studies at Wayne State University in Detroit. Other areas of research include postmodern culture and American literature; poetics; literary and cultural theory; visual studies; the avant-garde; and digital literature. Watten is married to the poet Carla Harryman; their son, Asa, was born in 1984. Early life and education Watten was born in Long Beach, California in 1948. After graduating from high school in Oakland, California, he studied at MIT and the University of California, Berkeley. He majored in biochemistry, graduating with an AB in 1969. But he had also met poets such as Robert Grenier and Ron Silliman and studied with Josephine Miles in the English department. He enrolled in the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. In 1971 he and Grenier began the poetry journal This. which he edited with Grenier for the first three years and alone until 1982. He graduated with a master's in fine arts degree in 1972. Career After graduation Watten returned to the San Francisco Bay area. He continued to publish This on his own and became involved in the early stages of language poetry which was developing there. In 1976 he and friends founded a reading series at the Grand Piano coffeehouse in San Francisco which ran through 1979. From 2006 to 2010 the group published The Grand Piano, a \\"collective autobiography\\" of that period. Watten continued to edit This until 1982. Then he and Lyn Hejinian founded and edited Poetics Journal from 1982 to 1993. In 1986 Watten returned to graduate school at Berkeley and received his PhD in English in 1995. He began teaching at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan in 1994. In 1995 he was the subject of a special issue of the poetry magazine Aerial. The American Comparative Literature Association awarded him the 2004 Ren√© Wellek Prize for his book The Constructivist Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics. As outlined in a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education, over the years Watten's behavior, allegedly short-tempered and hostile, had made many students and faculty uncomfortable. In the spring semester of 2019 several graduate students filed new complaints. Unhappy with the response, they set up a blog to collect accounts of his behavior toward students and faculty. In May the Wayne State administration hired an independent investigator. In November the university informed Watten that he was banned from teaching and his office would be moved to another building. Watten's faculty union, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), filed a grievance citing lack of required due process and requesting that the restrictions be withdrawn. Selected publications Watten edited This, one of the central little magazines of the Language movement, and co-edited Poetics Journal, one of its theoretical venues. In 1986, he returned to UC Berkeley, earning his PhD in English in 1996. His published work includes Bad History (1998) and Frame (1971‚Äì1990) which appeared in 1997. Frame brings together six previously published works of poetry from two decades: Opera‚ÄîWorks ; Decay ; 1‚Äì10 ; Plasma/Paralleles/\\"X\\" ; Complete Thought and Conduit - along with two previously uncollected texts - City Fields and Frame. Two of his books - Progress (1985) and Under Erasure (1991) - were republished with a new preface, as Progress  Under Erasure (2004). Watten is co-author, with Michael Davidson, Lyn Hejinian, and Ron Silliman, of Leningrad: American Writers in the Soviet Union (1991). He has published three volumes of literary and cultural criticism, Total Syntax (1985);The Constructivist Moment: From Material Text to Cultural Poetics (2003); and Questions of Poetics: Language Writing and Consequences (2016). Watten earned his PhD at the University of California at Berkeley in 1995. His dissertation was entitled: Horizon Shift: Progress and Negativity in American Modernism. In 2007, Martin Richet translated into French Plasma / Parall√®les / ¬´X¬ª, a volume that joins together three long poems which originally appeared in a chapbook by Tuumba Press in 1979.Le Quartanier √©diteur & revue Watten is also co-author, with Tom Mandel, Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, Kit Robinson, Carla Harryman, Rae Armantrout, Ted Pearson, Steve Benson, and Bob Perelman of The Grand Piano: An Experiment in Collective Autobiography. (Detroit, MI: Mode A/This Press, 2006-2010).For additional details, commentary, and links see Barrett Watten's piece How The Grand Piano Is Being Written This work, which consists of ten volumes, is describedin a publicity release at Watten's homepage (see \\"External links\\" above) as an \\"experiment in collective autobiography by ten writers identified with Language poetry in San Francisco. The project takes its name from a coffeehouse at 1607 Haight Street, where from 1976-79 the authors curated a reading and performance series.

The Congress was led by such anti- Treaty veterans as Peadar O'Donnell, Frank Ryan and George Gilmore. In their later phase they were involved with the Communist International and International Brigades paramilitary; the Connolly Column. The group claimed: \\"We believe that a republic of a united Ireland will never be achieved except through a struggle which uproots capitalism on its way.\\"Athlone Manifesto (8 April 1934), quoted in Republican Congress 5 May 1934 They were not a political party as such, but rather an extraparliamentary organisation dedicated to creating a \\"workers' republic,\\" which leaned towards the Communist Party of Ireland. They split mostly over whether they should be a party in their own right. History A group of republicans had founded a party, Saor √âire, in 1931, but it was banned later in the year. Despite this, many figures on the left wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) felt that the creation of a new party remained a priority, as they feared that supporters would otherwise turn to Fianna F√°il and the Communist Party of Ireland. The IRA organised a convention of its members in March 1934, which voted against creating a new party by a majority of one. The supporters of a new party, including Ryan, Michael Price, Gilmore, O'Donnell and Mick Fitzgerald, then walked out, and proceeded to create a new organisation.Tim Pat Coogan, The IRA, pp.79-84 On 8 April 1934, the founding conference of the Republican Congress party was held in Athlone, and a head office was established on Pearse Street in Dublin. The IRA published a statement which described the new party as \\"an attack by Republicans [which] can only assist the campaign of the Capitalist and Imperialist elements\\", and stating that they expected the party would soon drop abstentionism towards the D√°il. The former IRA members in the party leadership were expelled from the paramilitary organisation, but some less prominent figures, including Sheila Humphreys, Eithnie Coyle, Charles Reynolds, Seamus de Burca and George Leonard withdrew once they saw the IRA statement. However, other IRA members were won over and joined the Congress, including Liam Kelly, Joseph Doyle, Nora Connolly O'Brien and Roddy Connolly. Two councillors were elected as Republican Congress candidates in Westmeath and Dundalk in 1934. At the Republican rally at Bodenstown in 1934, clashes occurred between Republican Congress supporters and IRA members. Congress supporters among the crowd of about 17,000 were estimated at between 600 and 2,000. The IRA leadership did not authorise banners other than its own and ordered the Congress banners to be seized. The clash was given a sectarian element by the attack on 36 Congress members from the predominantly Loyalist parts of West Belfast - they formed the Shankill Road branch - who carried a banner reading, \\"Unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter to break the connection with Capitalism\\". Following moderate success in agitating on behalf of the workers the Congress split at its first annual conference held in Rathmines Town Hall on September 8‚Äì9, 1934. The split occurred mainly due to organisational disunity between two factions. One side believed that a united front of leftist republicans could challenge the dominance of the mainstream political parties and form a \\"republic\\". The opposing faction believed that a political party should be formed in order to fight for a \\"workers' republic\\". The former resolution was passed following support from O'Donnell and the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI). Those calling for a \\"workers' republic\\", including Price, withdrew their support and left the Congress. The group went into decline thereafter. An attempt to form a 100-member military-style organisation to infiltrate the political, social and trade union movements came to nothing, and in 1936 the party ran out of money. It briefly replaced its weekly newspaper, Republican Congress, with a new publication, the Irish People, but this made no difference, and the party office closed down. Despite this, the remaining leaders worked with the CPI to hold a series of public meetings, led by Willie Gallacher from the Communist Party of Great Britain, but following crowd trouble, these were abandoned, and the group undertook no public activities after November 1936. The Congress had its last hurrah on the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War when a group of Irishmen fought for the Second Spanish Republic in the Connolly Column (as part of the Communist International Brigades). The collapse of the Republican Congress is representative of the failure of the inter-war Irish socialist republican movement. The inability to form an organisationally coherent group was ultimately the crippling shortcoming of socialist republicanism.

It is a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. First foundation The monastery was founded in 1129 as a private monastery of the bishops of Eichst√§tt by Count Ernst of Hirschberg and his brother Gebhard of Hirschberg, Bishop of Eichst√§tt. The Romanesque crypt remains from the time of the foundation. After the decline in monastic standards in the 15th century, the abbey was reformed by Abbot Ulrich IV D√ºrner (1461‚Äì94), who also founded the brewery. The abbey was badly damaged during the German Peasants' War (1525) and again in the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48). Major buildings works in the Baroque style were undertaken from the end of the 17th century. Under Abbot Romanus Dettinger (1694‚Äì1703), he created the entrance gateway with the abbot's lodging above it, the Prelates' Hall and the Banqueting Hall, as well as the corner tower on the way to the inner courtyard. The next abbot, Dominikus II Heuber (1704‚Äì11), continued the building works with the move of the sacristy and the construction of the new brewery (now the library). Later in the century, Abbot Dominikus IV Fleischmann (1757‚Äì92) undertook the refurbishment of the abbey church. The crossing chapels are due to him; their stucco work was carried out by Johann Jakob Berg, stucco master to the court of Eichst√§tt. Dominikus IV was also responsible for the guesthouse opposite the main gateway. In 1806, in the course of the secularisation of Bavaria, the monastery was dissolved and the buildings and estates auctioned off. Second foundation As early as 1856, there were plans to re-found the abbey, but these came to nothing, as the government authorities refused to give the necessary consents. Finally, in 1904, thanks to the financial support of the Barons Cramer-Klett, Plankstetten was re-settled as a priory of Scheyern Abbey and was raised again to the status of abbey in 1917. A school of agriculture was opened in Bavaria in 1907. It was closed by the National Socialists in 1934. In 1958, a \\"Realschule\\" with a boarding house was opened in Bavaria. The school closed in 1988. This caused the abbey to re-examine their role and possible options, and the community now runs a training centre, a monastery shop, a farm, a nursery for plants, a butchery and a bakery, which have been organic since 1994. The boarding facilities are now used as a guesthouse. The first Young People's Vespers took place in Plankstetten on 17 October 1980 and have since become a regular event on the third Friday in every month. They are based on the youth vespers of the Benedictine abbey at Kremsm√ºnster in Austria and on the prayers of Taiz√©. The abbey also has parish responsibilities for Plankstetten and a neighbouring village.

As a player, he made 340 appearances in the Football League representing Sheffield Wednesday, West Ham United, Rotherham United and Peterborough United. As a manager, he took charge of Sheffield Wednesday and Leyton Orient. Career Eustace was born in Stocksbridge, West Riding of Yorkshire, and began his career as a trainee with Sheffield Wednesday. He made his debut in the 1962‚Äì63 season, and played more than 200 games in all competitions, before being sold to West Ham United for a club record ¬£90,000 fee. He played in midfield, earlier in his career at wing half, later at inside forward, who both made and scored goals. He also played for Rotherham United, Sheffield Wednesday again, and Peterborough United. He moved into management in November 1988 at Sheffield Wednesday, being promoted from assistant manager after Howard Wilkinson moved to Leeds United. Eustace was sacked after just three months and replaced by Ron Atkinson. He returned to football at Leyton Orient, working under Frank Clark, who moved from manager to managing director in 1991. Clark moved to Nottingham Forest in 1993, and Eustace was sacked a year later when the club failed to reach the play-offs. Eustace returned to Sheffield Wednesday as a scout during Chris Turner's brief managerial tenure, but was made redundant as part of an overhaul of the coaching staff in 2006. His claim for unfair dismissal was rejected by an industrial tribunal. He was for a time landlord of The Cheshire Cheese Inn pub in Hope, Derbyshire.

Schwarz was born in Munich on 14 June 1906 and originally worked as a book printer. He joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in November 1931. Following the outbreak of World War II, Schwarz served with the Waffen-SS on the Western Front until October 1940, when he was transferred to the SS- Concentration Camps Inspectorate. He was stationed at both the Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen concentration camps during 1940-1941. Auschwitz concentration camp In September 1941 Schwarz was transferred to Poland and posted to the administrative office of the Auschwitz concentration camp. His initial duties included working as adjutant to the camp's commandant, Rudolf H√∂√ü. Schwarz also served as director of the camp's Work Assignment Department (Abt. IIIa) and held the position of Lagerf√ºhrer for Auschwitz's central administration area. In November 1943, H√∂√ü was appointed assistant director of Office Group D for the SS Economic and Administrative Main Office in Berlin. Following his departure, the Auschwitz camp system was reorganized by the high command of the SS and divided into three semi-autonomous administrative units: Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau and the Auschwitz III-Monowitz labor camp. Under this new arrangement Schwarz was given command of Auschwitz III-Monowitz in December 1943. Central to the role Schwarz played as commandant was the provision of slave-laborers to the nearby Buna Werke, a synthetic rubber factory owned by the German chemical company IG Farben. Other German corporations, such as Siemens and Krupp, also received slave labor from Monowitz. The brutal working conditions which prevailed at Monowitz during the period Schwarz served as commandant resulted in a large number of deaths among the inmate population, with estimates ranging between 10,000 and 35,000 prisoners who were believed to have died in the labor camp itself or in the gas chambers located at neighboring Auschwitz-Birkenau. Following the evacuation of Auschwitz complex on 18 January 1945, Schwarz was initially slated to take over command of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp and the associated V-weapons production facility of Mittelwerk, but was passed over for this post in favor of Richard Baer. War crimes trial After the German defeat, Schwarz was tried and convicted of war crimes by French occupation authorities in Rastatt; in connection with atrocities committed during his brief tenure as commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof. He was sentenced to death and subsequently shot by firing squad near Baden-Baden on 20 March 1947.Today's Best Military Writing: The Finest Articles on the Past, Present, and Future of the U.S. Military by Walter J.

Adam Smith made reference to the term in claiming that mercantilist economic doctrine taught nations \\"that their interest lies in beggaring all their neighbours\\".Adam Smith: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Book IV, Chapter III (part II): \\"The sneaking arts of underling tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great empire ... . By such maxims as these, however, nations have been taught that their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours. Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to consider their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought naturally to be, among nations, as among individuals, a bond of union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity.\\" The term was originally devised to characterise policies of trying to cure domestic depression and unemployment by shifting effective demand away from imports onto domestically produced goods, either through tariffs and quotas on imports, or by competitive devaluation. The policy can be associated with mercantilism and neomercantilism and the resultant barriers to pan-national single markets. According to economist Joan Robinson beggar-thy-neighbour policies were widely adopted by major economies during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Alan Deardorff has analysed beggar-thy-neighbour policies as an instance of the prisoner's dilemma known from game theory: each country individually has an incentive to follow such a policy, thereby making everyone (including themselves) worse off. Reconciling the dilemma of beggar-thy- neighbor policies involves realizing that trade is not a zero-sum game, but rather the comparative advantage of each economy offers real gains from trade for all. An early 20th-century appearance of the term is seen in the title of a work on economics from the early period of the Great Depression: * Gower, E.A., Beggar My Neighbour! : The Reply to the Rate Economy Ramp, Assurance Agents' Press, (Manchester), 1932. The phrase is in widespread use, as seen in such publications as The Economist and BBC News.  Extended application  \\"Beggar thy neighbour\\" strategies of this kind are not limited to countries: overgrazing provides another example, where the pursuit by individuals or groups of their own interests leads to problems. This dynamic was dubbed the \\"tragedy of the commons\\" in an 1833 essay by British economist William Forster Lloyd, though it appears as early as the works of Plato and Aristotle. These trade policies can lead to trade wars between countries. These trade wars follow the prisoner's dilemma game theory analysis developed through Nash equilibrium in which two countries are poised against each other to produce in the market. Production requires export subsidies for the domestic firm to capture the market, effectively deterring the competing entity. Imagine two companies: Boeing and Airbus, one American, one European firm. They can either choose to produce or to not produce. The matrix follows that if both produce both will lose market share (‚àí5,‚àí5) as they compete in the industry. If they both do not produce (0,0) nobody benefits. If one produces whilst the other does not (100,0) the producing company will capture the industry and have 100% share (0,100). Game theory states that the first mover, or the initial firm in the industry, will always win. The competing firm will have no incentive to enter the market once the competitor has the advantage and thus will be deterred. However, with a strategic trade policy of an export subsidy, the matrix changes as the protecting government covers some of the costs. The matrix now changes from (‚àí5,‚àí5) to (‚àí5,20) in favour of the domestic firm with the subsidy. This will see the protected firm \\"win\\" in the game and capture more of the market share as the subsidies burden the costs, which would otherwise deter the company. The game does not finish here, as the other company, being usurped on the second move, will then itself become protected through export subsidies, leading to a trade war between countries. Ergo, beggar-thy-neighbour is evident in trade wars as it increases the domestic welfare at the expense of the competing country.  Other uses  The term has also been used as the title of a number of literary works: * Gerard, Emily and Gerard, Dorothea, Beggar My Neighbour: A Novel, W. Blackwood and Sons, (Edinburgh), 1882. * Drew, Sarah, Beggar My Neighbour, J.M. Ousley & Son, (London), 1922. * Fielden, Lionel, Beggar My Neighbour, Secker and Warburg, (London), 1943. * Ridley, Arnold, Beggar My Neighbour: A Comedy in Three Acts, Evans Bros., (London), 1953. * Macelwee, Patience, Beggar My Neighbour, Hodder and Stoughton, (London), 1956.
