Before From Autumn To Ashes he was in a local band called Who's To Blame with Francis Mark. Gross was one of the songwriters in From Autumn To Ashes and also wrote lyrics for the first two albums along with Perri and Mark.  Musical career  = Early Years (Before 1998) = Scott got into music after listening to the Pearl Jam album Ten and his mom bought him an electric guitar for Christmas.http://thrashmag.com/interviews/content.aspx?id=3131 = Who's To Blame (1998‚Äì2000) = Who's To Blame was a local band from the Long Island, New York area. The band consisted of Francis Mark, Scott Gross, Mike Pilato, and others. = From Autumn To Ashes (2000‚Äì2004) = Scott and a friend started talking about a new project while they still were in \\"Who's To Blame\\". They wanted to do something much more inspirational and complex. Something new for people to grab onto. That project became FATA. Scott and Fran were just out of high school when FATA started in September 1999. The line up to that time was: Scott Gross, Francis Mark, Steven Salvio, Benjamin Perri, Mike Pilato. On March 5, 2000 they've released their first demo called \\"Sin, Sorrow and Sadness\\" via Tribunal Records. After a while, before their debut was released, Steve left and Brian Deneeve joined the band. Mark said the following things about Salvio's department: \\"Basically the way that went was, we had another guitar player in the band, Steve, and he was a bit older than us. He was 27‚Äì28 years old. He had a career, like a real job that he planned on sticking with for the rest of his life. We started the band, it was just to have a good time, it wasn't serious. He thought he would be able to stick with job. Then when we started touring extensively, I quit school and all the other guys quit their jobs, we were like, 'Ok, you gotta quit, we gotta go.' And when it came down to it, he just couldn't do it. So he left, and we found this guy who has absolutely nothing else to live for but this band.\\" Gross recorded one demo and two albums with From Autumn To Ashes, before he left. = Taking A Break & First Steps Into Production (2004‚Äì2007) = When he asked to leave From Autumn To Ashes due to ongoing psychological problems and drug abuse he took a break from being a musician. He said in an interview: \\"I was tired of the rock n rock lifestyle, the endless touring and I didn't want to do music just to be popular.\\" He was in a few bands. One of these was called \\"The Mirror\\" but Scott got more and more into studio work. = Accident & Post- Accident (2007‚Äì2009) = In an interview with decoymusic, Scott said: \\"The basics are this. My car broke down on the side of the interstate. I pulled over, put my hazards on, and got out to call for help. When I got out of the car, another car drove off the right lane and hit me at 75 mph, pinning me between both cars, then [the other car] drove away, never hitting his breaks or stopping. The injuries were severe. My left leg was shattered open, bones littered across the interstate. The back of my head split in half, the car hit me so hard I had its part number indented into my chest. That's the accident. I was in a coma. I've been on therapy ever since, and they miraculously saved my leg, putting it back together with a bunch of titanium. Although they're not sure how much better it will get, I'm grateful to still have it. I work hard at therapy in hopes of one day getting this pain under control and walking normally again. Numerous surgeries and procedures undergone, many more to go most likely, so I say my prayers every day.\\"http://www.decoymusic.com/blog_posts/802 Because of the severity of his injuries, Scott was unable to move within the following years and that's what he got him more into studio work. = Lullaby The Storm (2009) = On February 17, 2009 the news came up that Scott will enter the studio sometime in March to begin production on an as-yet-unnamed new project. While Gross wrote all of the music and the bulk of the lyrics, he considered this a group effort. He said about that: \\"I recruited my friend Kia, who is an amazing musician, to handle vocals,\\". \\"I also have a keyboard player named Jeff who adds all these layers of sound to the songs.\\" Later it was revealed that Kia wasn't involved anymore.http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/interview/lullaby-the- storm/2009-04-30 On April 5 he started tracking and mentioned that it will be a concept album. Later the band name was revealed so as the members of the project: Scott Gross, Jeff Gillson, Mari-Elaina, Greg Odette Mari-Elana is the sister of Antonio Longo who was the original vocalist of Taking Back Sunday. He came up with all of the vocal melodies, harmonies and vocal arrangements. Antonio is an old friend of Scott. They were room mates. Scott was just his best man but he had no idea about Mari's vocal abilities until she came down to do a guest spot on the demos and Scott just knew he had to get her to sing on all of the songs. The meaning behind the bandname explained Scott in an interview with thrashmag: \\"Since I've been living in such an excruciating amount of pain since this car accident... it's the nights that get to you. You're all alone, time slows down, the clock ticks... you just want to sleep and the pain rains down on you...all you want is that cure.... that Lullaby that can put you to sleep, the calming of the storm. Until you experience something so purely evil it's really hard to even relate to.\\"http://thrashmag.com/interviews/content.aspx?id=3131 The sound of Lullaby The Storm stands between Elliot Smith and Jack's Mannequin according to Scott.

On May 12, 2012 Scott stated that the title of the new project's cd will be Emergency and that it's currently in the mixing process.https://www.facebook.com/#!/lullabythestorm2/posts/10151103473754251 In the meanwhile \\"Emergency\\" was released under the same band namehttps://soundcloud.com/emergencyli/tracks as of 2020 scott is now the exclusive producer of several up and coming rappers and singers, one of them being vampires4hie.https://soundcloud.com/vampires4hire Selected discography = with Emergency = * 2012 ‚Äì Emergency EP = with Lullaby The Storm = * 2009 ‚Äì 3 Lanes Painted Red (567 Records) = with From Autumn to Ashes = * 2003 ‚Äì The Fiction We Live (Vagrant Records) * 2001 ‚Äì Too Bad You're Beautiful (Ferret Music) * 2000 ‚Äì Sin, Sorrow, and Sadness (Tribunal Records) References External links *Official Website Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Living people Category:1979 births Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:21st- century American male musicians Category:From Autumn to Ashes members ","title":"Scott Gross"},{"id":"32971874","text":"Gusu may refer to: * Gusu District in China * Gusu woodland in southern Africa ","title":"Gusu"},{"id":"32971883","text":"The third season of the animated show Metalocalypse originally aired on Adult Swim from November 8, 2009 to October 24, 2010 with 10 episodes.

Among 27,000 entries, Winifred Kimball's \\"Broken Chains\\" was selected. The story was then given to experienced scenarist Carey Wilson to make it ready for filming. Allen Holubar was borrowed from Associated First National for the project. Colleen Moore was the first actor to be cast. Stories in the trade press suggested concerns as to whether she would be equal to the heavily dramatic role, but her prior work was not limited to comedy and she had not been typecast. The role was expected to be her big break but failed to establish her as a star. Casting was complete by June and filming was started. Portions of the film were shot in Northern California, near Santa Cruz in an area known as Poverty Flats. By August photography was completed. Reception Broken Chains premiered December 10, 1922, in New York and Los Angeles, and went into general release December 24. The Variety reviewer devoted several paragraphs to criticizing the climactic fight scene, calling it \\"preposterous\\" and reporting that the audience made fun of it. The plot overall was called \\"conventional\\"; however, the cast was commended. The review in The Film Daily found the scenario disappointing and opined, \\"The theme suffers severely from extreme characterization in each of the principal people.\\" The reviewer advised exhibitors that the film \\"will satisfy those who still like the old-fashioned type of meller\\" and called the posters good looking. In contrast, a review in Photodramatist, a magazine aimed at writers, praised both the story and the production: \\"There is the consummate handling of a subtle and really difficult theme, the sure touch in characterizations which so easily could have slipped into burlesque and bathos, the rapid piling of suspense on peril until the cumulative effect is terrific.\\" A critic for the Santa Cruz Evening News, locale of the exterior filming, singled out Moore for praise: \\"Colleen Moore ... attains new laurels as an emotional actress.

It sold a range of lawn mowers including lawn and garden tractors.  History  Atco is the trade name of lawn mower of Atlas Chain Company, formed in 1865, which made chains for ships. Atco was founded by Charles H Pugh in 1921. *Mowing machines (replacing scythes) were drawn by horses but, after a horse died while pulling a mower around his company's facility, Pugh created a petrol lawnmower, which became the first of its kind to be mass-produced anywhere in the world. * Pugh started making motor mowers under the tradename Atco (short for \\"Atlas Chain Company\\"), with a -wide cut. The Atco motor mower was an immediate success. 900 of them were made in 1921, each costing ¬£75. Within five years, annual production had accelerated to tens of thousands. Prices were cut and a range of sizes was available, making the Standard the first truly mass-produced motor mower. * 5 November 1981: In the early hours, a fire destroyed the old Charles H Pugh site and stock. The factory moved to Stowmarket in East Anglia, where it reopened as Atco Ltd. * 1991: Atco Ltd was renamed as Atco-Qualcast Ltd. * 1995: Atco-Qualcast Ltd was acquired by Robert Bosch GmbH and run as Atco-Qualcast Ltd. * 2011: Bosch sold the intellectual drawings, plant, equipment and tooling for the entire existing mower range to the Allett Mowers division of Turfmech Machinery Limited. Allett commenced manufacturing the range of Atco mowers with Allett branding instead of Atco, and with new model names. * 2011: Bosch licensed the Atco brand name to Global Garden Products Italy S.p.A. (part of STIGA S.p.A.), which launched a new Atco branded range of lawnmowers. * 29 April 2013: Global Garden Products Italy S.p.A. bought the Atco brand name from Bosch.  Products (1980‚Äì1992)  All the products below, from 1980‚Äì1992, are now obsolete. =Lawn & garden tractors=  Made in U.S. (1980‚Äì85)  From 1980, Atco Motor Mowers imported lawn and garden tractors from the United States, made to its designs. Atco 8/32E lawn tractor, 1980 The full model range of American-built Atco lawn and garden tractors was: * 7/32 ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 8/32E ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 8/36E ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 11/36E ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 16/42E ‚Äì 4-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck The \\"E\\" at the end of model number for American tractors stands for electric start; the 7/32 never had electric start but did have recoil start. Made in Britain (1986‚Äì92) In 1986, Atco stopped production of the American lawn and garden tractors and started producing its own in Stowmarket, Suffolk, in the United Kingdom. The first new model was the 11/36, which won \\"Best Grass Cutting Machine of The Year\\" in 1986. Atco 11/36 lawn tractor, 1986 Atco 8/30 lawn tractor, 1988 The full model range of British Atco lawn and garden tractors was: * 6/30 ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 8/30 ‚Äì 3-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 8/36 ‚Äì 5-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 11/36 ‚Äì 5-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck * 12/36 ‚Äì 5-speed with reverse, engine, cutter deck The 8/30 and 8/36 lawn tractors were sold with an option of a powered grass collector, while the 12/36 was only sold with a powered grass collector. The Atco 6/30 was an economy model with pull start, no electrical equipment, and a solid mild steel bonnet front. Atco also made a trailer to fit all models, with a hopper which tipped for emptying. There was a choice of or cutting widths, both having twin blades. 'V' channelling in the deck ensured that grass cut by one blade was not thrown in the path of the other blade. Grass was ejected not from the side, as was common with other tractors, but from the rear. That meant the non-collecting models could be hitched to a towed sweeper to collect grass cuttings, leaves and other debris. The tractors had , , or engines. The fuel tank provided approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes of continuous mowing. The tractors also featured wide pneumatic tyres. Atco was the first ride-on lawn tractor to have a powered grass sweeper, driven from a power take-off (PTO) at the rear of the machine. The PTO worked independently of the blades, so the user could cut the lawn without collecting the clippings or vice versa. Atco stopped making lawn tractors in 1992. When GGP Ltd bought the Atco name in 2011, the company started producing new lawn tractors branded Atco. =Lawn mowers=  Commodore ‚Äì domestic petrol cylinder mower (1986‚Äì92)  Available in four sizes of cut: , , and . Models Numbers for the Atco Commodore were: * Commodore B12 ‚Äì recoil start * Commodore B14 ‚Äì recoil start * Commodore B17 ‚Äì recoil start * Commodore B20 ‚Äì recoil start * Commodore B14 ‚Äì electric start * Commodore B17 ‚Äì electric start * Commodore B20 ‚Äì electric start Electric start models were available from April 1988.  Ensign ‚Äì domestic petrol cylinder mower (1990‚Äì92)  The Ensign had a cushion-grip handlebar that could be adjusted to height and an adjustable comb which lifted flattened stems which might not otherwise be cut. Polished beechwood front rollers allowed mowing up to the lawn edge and could be replaced quickly with sidewheels for cutting long or wet grass. Fitted with the Atco 144cc engine, the Ensign was available in a choice of three cutting widths: , and . Key start was available on the 14 in. and 17in. models.  Imperial ‚Äì domestic petrol cylinder mower (1990‚Äì92)  Both front and rear rollers could be individually levelled to maintain alignment between the mower and the lawn. As well as a comb for raising flattened grass, the Imperial had a scraper which prevented the build-up of grass on the steel front roller. A Mitsubishi key-start engine was fitted.  Royale ‚Äì heavy-duty petrol cylinder mower (1964‚Äì2011)  Top of Atco's cylinder mower range, the Royale was designed for large areas of fine lawn. The traditional 6-bladed steel cutting cylinder gave 70 cuts per yard while the heavy duty rollers helped to produce a striped finish. Early models of the Royale featured a Tecumseh‚Äìbuilt horizontal shaft engine with recoil start. Engines in later models were from Briggs & Stratton, with an electric start option introduced during the 1980s. The Recommended Retail Price of the machine, just before it was discontinued in 2011, was over ¬£2000, making it the most expensive mower in the Atco range. All three models ‚Äì , and ‚Äì were largely hand-built by a small team. Rotary mowers In more recent years, Atco has been producing rotary mowers powered by either petrol or electricity. Production of petrol-engined cylinder mowers continues with the \\"Clipper\\" range, in three sizes.

He was of Scottish and Irish descent on his paternal side and the heir to Machermore Castle, Newton Stewart, Kirkcudbrightshire. His family was prominent in Antigua. He lived many years in the Antilles and elsewhere in the West Indies. He recorded his impressions of the scenery and romance of the Western Archipelago in sundry volumes of verse, which contain a good many reminiscences of Byron and Moore. The notes are worth reading. Nugent Dunbar was also the author of a slight piece, \\"Garibaldi at the Opera of 'Masaniello'\\", octavo, London, 1864. As long ago as 1817, he had mourned the death of the Princess Charlotte of Wales in The Lament of Britannia, octavo, London. He died at Paris in 1866. Nugent Dunbar inherited the entailed estate at Machermore from his father in 1846. He married Annette Ellen Singleton-Atcheson in 1856 and left four young children upon his death. He in turn left it to his eldest son, Robert Lennox Nugent Dunbar (born 1863), held in trust by his son's tutors, with instructions to provide income to his widow and other surviving children, Ellen Catherine, Annette Roberta and Charlotte Mary Emily (who married James Burns, 3rd Baron Inverclyde). However, the estate failed to pay, and in 1872, his widow and three younger children successfully sued Robert Lennox Nugent Dunbar (still then a minor) and his trustees for back payment and interest.

He immigrated to New England in 1634 as a minor under the care of early Portsmouth settler William Freeborn. He was very active in civil as well as military affairs, and was an Assistant to the Governor for nine one-year terms between 1671 and 1686. During King Philip's War when the colony needed the advice and counsel of \\"the most judicious inhabitants\\" in the colony, his was one of 16 in a 1676 list of names, which included Governor Benedict Arnold and former President Gregory Dexter. When the colony's charter was suspended in 1686, and Rhode Island was placed under the Dominion of New England, Albro was chosen as a member of Sir Edmund Andros' council, and was present at its first meeting in Boston. Albro remained active in the affairs of the colony while well advanced in age, and even when nearly 80 years old, he was reimbursed for an official trip he made to Boston in 1697. He was a Quaker and died in 1712 at a very advanced age, and was buried \\"in his own orchard\\" according to the Friends' records.  Life  Sailing to New England aboard the ship Francis in 1634, John Albro was a teenager under the care of William Freeborn, and as a young adult followed Freeborn to Portsmouth in the Rhode Island colony in 1638. The following year he was granted a lot within the town, provided he build within a year's time. Five years later, in 1644, he joined the Portsmouth Militia, being assigned as a Corporal, and remained active therein for most of his life, attaining the rank of Major. He was also very active in civil affairs as well, and in 1649 was a clerk of weights and measures, a member of the Town Council, and also served as Moderator, which he continued to do well into his later years. Early in his career Albro was a coroner, and was one of the first men sent for when the burnt remains of Rebecca Cornell were discovered at her home, a death for which her son, Thomas Cornell, was tried and convicted of murder. In 1671 Albro was first elected as the Portsmouth Assistant to the Governor, and he served in this capacity for a total of nine years, last holding the position in 1686. From 1675 to 1676, King Philip's War, \\"the most disastrous conflict to ever devastate New England,\\" left the mainland towns of Rhode Island in ruins. This confrontation between many indigenous people and the English settlers was named for Metacomet, sachem of the Wampanoags, who was also called King Philip. Though much more at peace with the Indians than the other colonies, because of geography, the Rhode Island colony took the brunt of damage from this conflict, and the settlements of Warwick and Pawtuxet were totally destroyed, with much of Providence destroyed as well. In April 1676 it was voted by the Assembly \\"that in these troublesome times and straits in this Colony, this Assembly desiring to have the advice and concurrence of the most judicious inhabitants, if it may be had for the good of the whole, do desire at their next sitting the company and counsel of\\" 16 persons, one of whom was Major Albro. This list included very prominent members of the colony such as Governor Benedict Arnold, President Gregory Dexter, and Deputy Governor James Barker. During the war, Albro was a member of a court martial held at Newport for the trial of certain Indians complicit in King Philip's designs, and after the war he sat on a variety of committees, mostly concerning the disputed boundaries of the Rhode Island colony. Following King Philip's War, several of the governors of the colony died in office, and Albro was appointed, with other members of a committee, to secure the royal charter and other state papers from the widow or family of the deceased governor. He was required to do this twice in 1678, following the death of Governor Benedict Arnold in June 1678, and then again in November 1678 following the death of Governor William Coddington. In 1683 he and a committee were tasked to retrieve the documents from a living governor, Peleg Sanford, who had been replaced that May by William Coddington Jr. In 1685 the colony began to lose its freedoms when Edward Randolph urged the Board of Trade to revoke the charters of both Rhode Island and Connecticut because of alleged irregularities. In October of that year Joseph Dudley was appointed to govern the colonies of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, and King's Province, the latter in the Narragansett country (later Washington County, Rhode Island), and Randolph was made secretary of his council. At the election of May 1686, Walter Clarke was chosen governor of the Rhode Island colony, but served only a few weeks before the Dominion of New England was imposed on the northern colonies, and Edmund Andros was appointed as the Royal Governor. In December 1686, Albro became a member of Andros' Council, and was present at its first meeting in Boston, being required to take an oath of allegiance. Andros ruled for nearly three years, when in April 1689 news of the ascension of William III and Mary II to the English throne arrived in Boston, and Andros and Randolph were both arrested, after which Rhode Island returned to its chartered government. Albro remained active in the affairs of the colony until very late in his life, being reimbursed for expenses for an official trip to Boston in 1697, when he was nearly 80 years old. He wrote his will on 28 December 1710, and died two years later, in December 1712, aged about 95 years. Because his death was recorded in the records of the Society of Friends, Albro apparently became a Quaker at some point in his life.  Family  About 1645, Albro married Dorothy, the widow of Nathaniel Potter, whose maiden name is not known. John and Dorothy had five known children, all of whom grew to maturity, married, and had children. Their two sons Samuel and John were both original proprietors of the settlement of East Greenwich.

Plot  Coco and his pregnant wife Pipi move into a Buenos Aires apartment complex. As they bicker and shop for food at the local market, they fail to notice the increasingly panicked crowds around them. When they return to their apartment, it is quarantined by the government. Coco, too apathetic to care about the looming threat of a pandemic, attempts to sleep through the disaster, but he is quickly annoyed by the loss of Internet service and television. His neighbor Horatio, a paranoid survivalist whose reinforced apartment doubles as a bunker, slowly recruits Coco as an ally against other tenants. With Coco's help, Horatio sets traps throughout the building, which Coco negligently trips several times. Still unconvinced of the danger of the situation, Coco halfheartedly submits to Horatio's demands that he wear a hazmat suit, carry a pistol, and watch a survival training video that suggests the pandemic may be a plot by the New World Order. Zanutto, an elderly man who is suspected of being sick by other tenants, is perceived as a weak target that they can prey upon. After using a shotgun to dispatch the tenants who came to harm him, Zanutto becomes paranoid, which leads him to preemptively pursue the remaining tenants. Horatio convinces Coco to leave Pipi and help him confront Zanutto, but Coco proves to be an inept ally. After a tense shootout, Zanutto slashes Horatio, but Horatio mortally stabs Zanutto. Zanutto and Coco work out a truce, and Zanutto asks Coco to watch his dachshund dog before he crawls into his car and succumbs to the knife wound. Soon after Horatio and Coco go scavenging out of the complex, and finally Coco proves his worth by defending Horatio against armed men who attack the duo, shooting and killing the aggressors. Horatio, visibly weakened from his wound, and worried about his contact with a sick and contagious Zanutto, tells Coco that he believes he is infected and asks him to take care of his daughter and to take her and Pipi out of the city, to a secret hideout Horatio made. Horatio reveals the location of the hideout, but Coco doesn't feel ready to take over Horatio's lead. Coco's refusal and indifference enrages Horatio, who now blames Coco as to just have been using him to survive. Horatio stabs Coco, hoping that Coco will kill him before he succumbs to the disease. Despite his wound Coco flees from Horatio, and the Chinese father of the family that was presumed to be absent from the building suddenly appears and shoots Horatio through the neck. While dying in the building's stairwell Horatio smiles satisfied, having avoided a ghastly death from the disease. Coco, the Chinese family, and the remaining survivors of the complex use Horatio's armored vehicle to make their way to Horatio's hideout.

(1984), p 44. The EU is a member of the Quartet and is the single largest donor of foreign aid to Palestinians. International Recognition of Israel and Palestine in Europe. As of 2015, 9 out of 28 EU member states recognize Palestine. In 2014, Sweden became the first member to recognize Palestine. Malta and Cyprus had recognized Palestine prior to joining the EU, as did a number of Central European member states when they were allied with the Soviet Union. However, some of these states, the Czech Republic in particular, have emerged as Israel‚Äôs closest allies in Europe.  Representation  The EU maintains a representative office in Ramallah, accredited to the PNA. The PLO's general delegation in Brussels, accredited to the EU, was first established as an information and liaison bureau in September 1976. Other representations are maintained in almost every European capital, many of which have been accorded full diplomatic status. The EU's special envoy to the Middle East Peace Process is Susanna Terstal. In western Europe, Spain was the first country granting diplomatic status to a PLO representative, followed later by Portugal, Austria, France, Italy and Greece.  Position on Israeli issues  The EU has insisted that it will not recognise any changes to the 1967 borders other than those agreed between the parties. Israel's settlement program has therefore led to some tensions, and EU states consider these settlements illegal under international law.East Jerusalem should be Palestinian capital, says EU draft paper In 2008, during the French presidency of the Council, the European Union strived to increase cooperation with the US on Middle-Eastern issues, inter alia with a view to coordinating common pressures on Israel.Tsilla Hershco and Amos Schupak, France, the EU presidency and its implications for the Middle-East , The Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs, Volume 3 No 2, July 19, 2009, pp. 63-73 The EU has also been highly critical of Israeli military actions in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon, often referring to them as \\"disproportionate\\" and \\"excessive force\\" and calling for an immediate cease- fire. During Operation Defensive Shield, the European Parliament passed a non- binding resolution calling for economic sanctions on Israel and an arms embargo on both parties. Following the Gaza War, the European Parliament endorsed the Goldstone Report. The EU has also been critical of Israel's Gaza blockade, referring to it as \\"collective punishment\\".  Position on recognition  EU first endorsed the idea of Palestinian statehood in its 1999 Berlin Declaration. Before that, the EU and its predecessor, the EC, had since 1973 through various declarations legitimized Palestinian rights in the form of recognizing the Palestinians as \\"a people\\", the need for them to have \\"homeland\\" and exercising their \\"right to self-determination\\". In July 2009, EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana called for the United Nations to recognise the Palestinian state by a set deadline even if a settlement had not been reached: \\"The mediator has to set the timetable. If the parties are not able to stick to it, then a solution backed by the international community should ... be put on the table. After a fixed deadline, a UN Security Council resolution ... would accept the Palestinian state as a full member of the UN, and set a calendar for implementation.\\" In December, the Council of the European Union endorsed a set of conclusions on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict which forms the basis of present EU policy. It reasserted the objective of a two-state solution, and stressed that the union \\"will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties.\\" It recalled that the EU \\"has never recognised the annexation of East Jerusalem\\" and that the State of Palestine must have its capital in Jerusalem. A year later, in December 2010, the Council reiterated these conclusions and announced its readiness, when appropriate, to recognise a Palestinian state, but encouraged a return to negotiations. Eight of its 27 member states have recognised the State of Palestine. In 2011, the Palestinian government called on the EU to recognise the State of Palestine in a United Nations resolution scheduled for 20 September. Mahmoud Abbas reiterated such calls in Brussels again in early 2018.. EU member states grew divided over the issue. Some, including Spain, France and the United Kingdom, stating that they might recognise if talks did not progress, while others, including Germany and Italy, refused. Catherine Ashton said that the EU position would depend on the wording of the proposal. At the end of August, Israel's defence minister Ehud Barak told Ashton that Israel was seeking to influence the wording: \\"It is very important that all the players come up with a text that will emphasise the quick return to negotiations, without an effort to impose pre-conditions on the sides.\\" EU member states were divided in their vote on United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 in 2012, which recognized Palestine as a non-member observer state at the UN. 14 member states voted for, 13 abstained and the Czech Republic voted against. In 2014, the European Union and the United States officially criticised Israel's settlement policies in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians regard as their de jure capital, and warned against the further construction of Israeli homes on disputed land.European Union Slams Israel on New Settlement Plan In December 2014, the European Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution calling for the recognition of Palestinian statehood as part of a two-state solution and alongside the development of the peace process with 498 votes in favour, 88 against and 111 abstentions. In recent years, many European parliaments including France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Ireland and the United Kingdom have passed motions calling on their governments to recognize Palestine. On December 9, 2019, new EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said ministers \\"will deeply discuss the situation in the Middle East\\" when they meet again in Brussels on January 20, 2020. Ireland and Luxembourg are among a small group of countries that want the issue put on the agenda; in a letter to Borrell, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said that hopes for a two-state solution are \\"being dismantled piece by piece, day after day,\\" and that it is time to consider recognizing Palestine as a state.  EU Palestine Support  The Palestinian news agency Maan reported in 2011, citing a senior official at the Palestinian Ministry of Planning, that the PA has received about US$20 billion in donor funds since the peace process began. It is estimated that the EU, including individual contributions by its members, has given ‚Ç¨10 billion to the Palestinians since the peace process began in 1994. Economic assistance to the PA and the Palestinian people constitutes the EU‚Äôs highest per capita foreign aid program.Persson, Anders (2015).

It is approximately the size of Puerto Rico, but has only approximately 8,000 residents. Its vast expanses of undeveloped land and low population density (1.31/km2), together with Andros' unique combination of undisturbed environmental features, presents a rare opportunity for environmental preservation. Globally-imperiled pine rocklands are prime habitat for migratory songbirds such as the Kirtland's warbler, one of North America's rarest birds. These forests are abutted by Hardwood forests and expanses of freshwater marshes. Other fauna found on the island include giant land crabs, the Bahama woodstar hummingbird, the West Indian whistling duck and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana, listed as threatened with extinction.

When combined with fresh or salt water and oxygen, it will cause crude oil and other organic substances to rapidly decompose, eventually biodegrading them to carbon dioxide and water. Introduction Oil Spill Eater II is a bioremediation process for the mitigation of hazardous waste, spills and contamination. It uses bioremediation processes that eliminate hazardous materials.\\"OSEI - Oil Spill Eater International, Corp.\\" OSEI. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Apr. 2013. It is a biological enzyme that converts the oil spills into a natural food source for the enhanced native bacteria found in the environment. The result of this process is CO2 and water. The enzyme permanently eliminates the hazardous waste problem, with no secondary cleanup required. [1] How It Works  Oil spill eater II contains the biosurfactants, nutrients and other constituents for complete life cycles and biodegradation. When Oil spill Eater II is added to a spill, the process generally takes a few minutes to several minutes, depending on how heavy the damage is of the spill.Oil Spill Eater International Corp. (2011). Oil spill eater ii: Technical information. As the biosurfactants do their job, the enzymes attach themselves to broken down hydrocarbon structures, forming digestive binding sites. Results * The toxicity of the spill is rapidly diminished. * The odor or smell is almost non-existent. * The oil or spill will no longer adhere to anything. * The spill is caused to float.[2] Oil Spill Eater II causes the oil to come onto the surface of the water, which reduces the impact to the sub-surface.[2] It starts to prevent secondary contamination of the water column or tertiary contamination on the body of water associated with the spill area. The spill being held on the surface will make it easy to monitor.[2] Economy The product can reduce costs on clean up of spills quite substantially. Contact OSEI Corporation for information. Health factors The product is non-toxic to humans, animals, plants and marine life and is very safe because it is non-poisonous and non-irritating. It contains no known allergens to cause skin, respiratory or other allergic reactions.\\"II - Oil Spill Eater (OSE).\\" By OSEI Corp. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Apr. 2013.

Its eleven story edifice was originally designed by architect Clinton J. Warren as an annex to the Auditorium Theater across the street. The two buildings were linked by a marble-lined underground passage called Peacock Alley. After opening for business in 1893, for the World's Columbian Exposition, the hotel underwent two major expansions and renovations, first in 1902 and then again in 1907 which brought the total complex up to . The design and construction of these two additions were overseen by the firm of Holabird & Roche. The hotel now features 871 guest rooms and suites. Through the 1930s the hotel was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management Company. At this same time, part of the hotel was used as the location for a Benny Goodman NBC Radio Show.Congress Hotel History;http://www.congressplazahotel.com/history-en.html Following the outbreak of World War II, the Government purchased the Congress Hotel and used it as a training school for U.S. Army Air Forces. It reopened for civilian use in time for the summer political conventions of 1944. At this time, John J. Mack was president of the Michigan-Congress Hotel Corporation.Associated Press, \\"Reopen Big Hotel\\", The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington, Wednesday 19 January 1944, Volume 61, Number 250, page 3. In 1950, the Pick Hotel Corporation bought the hotel and oversaw a major renovation of the entire hotel, which included new suites and restaurants. Another modernization project began in the 1960s, which added a ballroom and escalators. The hotel is not currently affiliated with any national chain. It has been owned by a group of investors led by Albert Nasser of Tel-Aviv, Israel, since 1987. The hotel is frequently noted as one of the most haunted buildings in Chicago. The podcast \\"And That's Why We Drink\\" used stories of the haunted activity of the hotel as a topic in their February 19, 2018 episode (episode #55). Hosting Presidents and Major Events Over the years the Congress has welcomed many presidents as well as hosted major events. Presidents who have stayed at or visited the Congress include Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Franklin Roosevelt. In June, 1912, Theodore Roosevelt stayed at the Congress Plaza when the 1912 Republican National Convention was held in Chicago. Roosevelt, who at that time was seeking the Republican nomination for President, spoke from the balcony of his room at the hotel to a crowd assembled across the street in Grant Park. In October 1916, US President Woodrow Wilson passed the hotel as part of his visit to the city. Over a hundred protestors from the National Women's Party demonstrated in favor of women's suffrage with a silent protest. Holding banners such as \\"Wilson is Against Women,\\" the demonstrators were attacked by a mob and their banners destroyed while police looked on and, in some cases, laughed, according to newspaper reports. Events that have been held at the hotel include the 1963 Prohibition Party National Convention on August 23, 1963. Strike On 15 June 2003, about 130 members of UNITE HERE Local 1 went on strike to protest a proposed seven percent wage cut. On 16 June 2007, Barack Obama, then running for the presidency, briefly stood by the picket line and promised to return as president, but he did not. The strike, one of the world's longest, ended May 30, 2013 after nearly 10 years. No concessions were given by management. Murals Taos Society of Artists painter, E. Martin Hennings painted the ceiling murals inside the Florentine Room around 1918. In 1940, Louis Grell (1887‚Äì1960), a Chicago-based artist, was commissioned to paint thirteen murals for the lunettes that are an architectural feature surrounding the grand lobby. The murals were various popular scenes around Chicago at the time. Under the Albert Pick Jr ownership in 1952, Grell was again commissioned to paint the same architectural lunettes, this time Grell incorporated Chicago figures into the scenes depicting important trades significant to Chicago's growth and symbolism. Lady Liberty was found in one mural holding the Chicago River \\"Y\\" on her lap. Additionally, in 1955 Pick commissioned Grell once again, during one of the many renovations, to paint three walls for the newly decorated Pompeian Room which also had a magnificent Louis Comfort Tiffany glass fountain in the center of the vast room. Today glass covers the thirteen lunettes where the murals could be hiding. Grell also painted a large white Peacock that was mounted above the bar next to Peacock Alley. Each wall had a main central Greek/Roman mural, however, Grell decorated the entire wall with various patterns of flora and custom design.

Background and trial On 29 January 2003, Nat Fraser was convicted by a majority verdict at the High Court at Edinburgh, before Lord Mackay of Drumadoon and a jury, of the murder of his wife Arlene. He was duly sentenced to life imprisonment with a punishment part of 25 years. His wife had disappeared in 1998 and he insisted that he was innocent of any involvement in her disappearance and presumed death.A. Cramb, \\"Nat Fraser sentenced to life for wife's murder\\", The Daily Telegraph, (London, 30 January 2003) The cornerstone of the Crown's case against Fraser was that on 7 May he had returned certain rings from the dead body of his wife, 9 days after she vanished, in order to foster the appearance that she had decided to leave of her own volition. The trial judge directed the jury that they were obliged to acquit Fraser if they were unsure that he had returned the rings to the house.Supreme Court Judgment at [2] Initial appellate proceedings Fraser lodged a note of appeal against conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal was heard by the Lord Justice Clerk (Lord Gill), Lord Osborne and Lord Johnston. It emerged that two police constables had given witness statements to the Crown before the trial to the effect that they had seen jewellery, including the rings, in the Fraser's house on 28 and 29 April. Fraser's two grounds of appeal were that the new evidence had a vital bearing on the jury's verdict, and that its non- disclosure to the defence had cause a miscarriage of justice. However, the court unanimously refused Fraser's appeal on the grounds, that notwithstanding the fresh evidence and the non-disclosure, the strength of the circumstantial evidence against Fraser was so strong that no miscarriage of justice had occurred.Fraser v. Her Majesty's Advocate [2008 ScotHC HCJAC_26] (6 May 2008) Appeal to the Supreme Court Fraser applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the grounds that his case involved a devolution issue, namely that his prosecution and conviction had infringed his rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. His application was refused as incompetent by the Appeal Court on 24 March 2009, on the grounds that the issues had already been determined in the earlier appeal proceedings and that Parliament had not intended, in the Scotland Act 1998, to allow the Privy Council to review the merits of decisions of the Appeal Court.Fraser v. Her Majesty's Advocate [2009 ScotHC HCJAC 27] (24 March 2009) The Middlesex Guildhall, seat of the Supreme CourtFraser then applied for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council directly. However, the determination of his application was delayed pending the resolution of two other Scottish cases, by which point the jurisdiction of the Privy Council to determine devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998 had been transferred to the Supreme Court. On 20 May 2011, the Supreme Court granted his application for special leave to appeal.Supreme Court Judgment at [10] Lord Hope of Craighead delivered the majority judgment. Reaffirming that the High Court remained the final court of appeal in criminal matters in Scotland and that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to review the merits of its decisions made in exercise of that function,Supreme Court Judgment at [11] he ruled that the Appeal Court had applied the wrong test in law in relation to article 6(1), namely, whether they believed that there had been a miscarriage of justice rather than whether there was 'a real possibility that the jury at this trial would have arrived at a different verdict' which created a miscarriage of justice, based on the precedent of McInnes v Her Majesty's Advocate.Supreme Court Judgment at [38] He concluded that a real possibility existed, and accordingly allowed the appeal, and remitted the matter to the Appeal Court with a direction to quash Fraser's conviction, once it had decided whether he should be re-tried, in exercise of the court's powers under paragraph 13 of Schedule 6 to the Scotland Act 1998.Supreme Court Judgment at [42]-[43] Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood agreed that the Appeal Court had applied the wrong test in law and would have allowed the appeal but was inclined to have remitted the whole case to the Appeal Court, absent a direction to quash. He did not, however, carry this view to dissent.Supreme Court Judgment at [51]-[52] Aftermath =Legal consequences= On 17 June 2011, in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court, the Appeal Court quashed Fraser's conviction and granted authority to bring a new prosecution.BBC News Online, \\"Nat Fraser faces Arlene murder case retrial\\", BBC News (17 June 2011) On 23 April 2012, Fraser's retrial began at the High Court at Edinburgh before Lord Bracadale and a jury.BBC News Scotland:NE, Orkney & Shetland, \\"Nat Fraser faces trial in April over murder of wife Arlene\\", BBC News Online, (17 February 2012)BBC News, \\"Nat Fraser goes on trial accused of murdering wife Arlene\\", BBC News Online, (23 April 2012) On 30 May 2012, Fraser was convicted of the murder of his wife, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a punishment part of seventeen years.BBC News, \\"Nat Fraser found guilty for second time of murdering wife Arlene in 1998\\", BBC News Online, (30 May 2012) =Political consequences= Alex Salmond was accused of \\"unbelievable ignorance\\" The Supreme Court ruling was controversially attacked by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny McAskill MSP who threatened to withhold funding for the court on the grounds that it was undermining Scottish judicial independence.D.

It began on August 29, 2011 on MSNBC's weekday 6 PM slot, the first time that the slot had been occupied by a branded series since January 2011. In August 2015, it was announced that the series would move to just once a week on Sundays at 8AM starting on October 4, 2015. The series aired its final weekday episode on September 4, 2015. History =6 PM slot prior to renaming= PoliticsNation was the formal renaming of the 6 PM weekday slot that had been occupied by a broadcast named MSNBC Live (sharing the same \\"generic\\" title as the primary morning-to-afternoon rolling- news program primarily staffed by anchors.) Sharpton had served as host of the slot since July, and was preceded by Cenk Uygur from January to June. Prior to Uygur, the slot had been occupied by The Ed Show from April 6, 2009 to January 24, 2011 (eventually moving to the 10 PM slot following Keith Olbermann's departure from MSNBC), and by 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from March 17, 2008 (as Race to the White House) to April 3, 2009. =Al Sharpton and MSNBC= Sharpton's involvement with MSNBC began after June 29, 2011 when he became the primary substitute host for The Ed Show, leading to press speculation that Sharpton could attain his own series on the network in the vein of Rachel Maddow (who attained her own series in 2008 after serving as Keith Olbermann's primary substitute host on Countdown with Keith Olbermann), Lawrence O'Donnell (who attained his own series in 2010 after having served as Olbermann's primary substitute host) and Christopher Hayes (who attained his own weekend series beginning in mid-September 2011 after having served as a regular fill- in for both Maddow and O'Donnell). Reception After beginning his appearances as substitute host for Ed Schultz, conservative commentators and outlets slammed MSNBC's decision to hire Sharpton as a contributor (and even more so after becoming host of what became PoliticsNation); EURweb cited mockery of Sharpton by such conservative outlets as Breitbart.tv in particular, doubts were raised by at least one member of the National Association of Black Journalists about Sharpton's ability to host a credible political talk show following past controversial comments, and criticism by African-American journalists raised the possibility of MSNBC having hired Sharpton in order to draw ratings. In response, Tamika Mallory, executive director of the National Action Network (which is headed by Sharpton as president) rebutted many of the criticisms in an editorial for TV One's NewsOne website, and also likened black criticism of MSNBC's decision to \\"crabs in a barrel\\". Parody Sharpton's style of delivery, verbalized understanding of topics on PoliticsNation and a live flub with the teleprompter have been the subject of parody, especially on NBC series Saturday Night Live with Kenan Thompson playing Sharpton. It was the subject of a December 10, 2011 skit parodying the flub as well as a May 19, 2012 skit with guest star Mick Jagger as a JPMorgan Chase executive. Sharpton himself enjoyed the skits, and had Thompson on his show in February 2015. Sharpton returned the favor by appearing on SNL in March 2016.

Background While Sk√°lm√∂ld was initially formed with intention to be just a hobby, the band members soon decided to record an album. In January 2010, the band recorded its first demo, consisting of two song, \\"√År√°s\\" and \\"Kva√∞ning\\", but it was never released. In May 2010, Sk√°lm√∂ld entered Studio Reflex in Reykjav√≠k to record its first album. Music Baldur is a concept album, telling a story of a fictional eponymous Viking with lyrics inspired by the Icelandic sagas and Norse mythology, entirely in Icelandic. A demon-like creature attacks Baldur's home and kills his wife and children, forcing him on a quest for revenge, aided by two friends. After much hardship, they fight their enemy. Baldur's friends die in the final battle and, having defeated the enemy, he succumbs to his wounds as well, joining his family in Valhalla. For the album's re-release, the band decided to record a bonus track, \\"Baldur\\", which proved to be challenging, since it had to supplement the completed story line. Baldur's lyrics conform to the rules of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, the Old Norse alliterative verse, while music combines folk melodies, with the elements from melodic death, doom and thrash metal, creating an overall epic atmosphere. The album and protagonist were named after Baldur Ragnarsson, guitarist with the band and brother of main songwriter Sn√¶bj√∂rn.

He played college football at New Mexico, and was signed by the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent in 2011. Early years Bell attended Greenville High School, where he played offensive tackle for the Lions football team. He also was a Golden Gloves boxer, but gave up the sport as a senior, when he started being recruited by colleges. He received All- state honors as a senior. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of New Mexico. As a freshman, he played in one game and missed the rest of the season with a knee injury. The next year, he started 12 games at right tackle, while allowing only 3 sacks and helping the team to average 204.9 rushing yards per game, ranking third in the conference and 16th in the nation. As a junior, he was moved to left tackle and started 12 games, but was a part of a team that only won one contest. As a senior, he started 12 games and received the team's outstanding offensive lineman award, but the team again won only one contest. He finished his college career after appearing in 37 games with 36 starts. Professional career =Carolina Panthers= After going undrafted in the 2011 NFL Draft, Bell signed with the Carolina Panthers. As a rookie, he was named the starter at right tackle in the second game after Jeff Otah sustained a concussion in the season opener. He returned to a backup role until the seventh game, when Otah was placed on injured reserve because of a knee and back injury. Bell appeared in 16 games with 12 starts. In 2012, he opened as the team's first-string right tackle ahead of Otah in Organized Team Activities and remained in that role after Otah was traded on July 23. He started at right guardin the sixth game against the Dallas Cowboys and moved back to tackle for the rest of the season. He appeared 16 games with 15 starts. In 2013, he played 16 games with 14 starts at right tackle, but struggled in pass protection. Against the Buffalo Bills, he allowed 3.5 sacks (part of a 4.5 sack record for a Panthers opponent) against defensive end Mario Williams in a 23‚Äì24 loss. The following week he bounced back and did not allow a sack in a 38‚Äì0 win against the New York Giants. In 2014, with the retirement of Jordan Gross, he was thrust into the left tackle position. He started 17 games including two playoff contests, but struggled even more than in the previous year. He missed the ninth game against the New Orleans Saints with a knee injury. He wasn't re-signed after the season. =Tennessee Titans= On April 22, 2015, he was signed as a free agent by the Tennessee Titans, to provide depth in the wake of Michael Roos' retirement and Taylor Lewan's move to left tackle. He started all 16 games for the first time of his career, splitting time between left guard and right tackle. On May 24, 2016, Bell suffered a dislocated left ankle during OTAs and was ruled out for the entire season. =Dallas Cowboys= On March 24, 2017, he signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys, to provide depth after right tackle Doug Free retired and left guard Ronald Leary was lost in free agency. During preseason he competed for the open left guard position. He began the regular season as the Cowboys' backup swing tackle, until Chaz Green returned to that role after being passed on the depth chart at left guard by Jonathan Cooper in the sixth game against the San Francisco 49ers. In Week 9 against the Atlanta Falcons, he replaced Green in the third quarter at left tackle, who up to that point had allowed five sacks to defensive end Adrian Clayborn. Bell allowed one more sack, even though the Cowboys coaches were criticized for not adjusting their game plan to stop Clayborn. Green would not recover from the debacle and did not play another snap for the rest of the year, with Bell starting the last 2 games at left tackle in place of an injured Tyron Smith. He was not re-signed after the season. =Green Bay Packers= On May 30, 2018, the Green Bay Packers signed Bell to a one-year, $1.6 million contract that included a $500,000 signing bonus. He suffered a knee injury on December 2, 2018 during a 20‚Äì17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, and was placed on injured reserve on December 12. Bell played in 12 games for the Packers in 2018, starting nine of those games. He did not commit a single penalty all season, and allowed only 1.5 sacks prior to the injury.

Published by Top Cow Productions, it tells the story of Brian Cohn, a man with schizophrenia who learns his father may have been a serial killer. The first issue was released in December 29, 2010. Publication history Joshua Hale Fialkov and Rahsan Ekedal first worked together in 2008 on The Cleaners, a horror comic book series for the publisher Dark Horse Comics. Fialkov brought the story to Ekedal in its early stages, and Ekedal provided some concept art to accompany the pitch. After being accepted by Top Cow, Fialkov crafted the story mostly by himself, although he did adapt the script to Ekedal's style.Bradley, Drew, \\"Artist August: Rashan Ekedal interview\\", www.multiversitycomics.com, 15 August 2012 The art in Echoes is completely black and white, which was more affordable for the artists, but also because Failkov felt grayscale was more effective. The artistic style was inspired by the Warren Publishing horror comic books Creepy and Eerie from the 1960s and 1970s, which both Fialkov and Ekedal enjoyed. Ekedal said of the artistic style: \\"A lot of the look developed out of my attempts to visually represent what it means to suffer from a serious mental disorder. So I tried to put Brian's doubts and terrors into every shadow, every line.\\" Fialkov said the idea of a suburban setting with an ordinary- seeming killer was conceived because its \\"so much scarier and so much more upsetting\\" than an urban setting. The idea of the dolls made from victims' flesh came from Fialkov's research about voodoo, as well as his own interest in cults and secret societies. Fialkov also said Echoes was partially inspired by the 1960 horror film Psycho, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, because he felt both stories were driven by the characters and drama rather than the horror. Fialkov described the series as \\"achingly dark\\", and said of writing it: \\"I haven't really done a hard horror book in a long time. It was a lot of fun to actually do something that's just grotesque and upsetting.\\" The first issue was included in the September 2010 release of Top Cow First Look, a trade paperback highlighting several of the publisher's new releases. The first issue was officially released on December 29, 2010. Ekedal said the book's reception far exceeded his expectations, with four Harvey Award nominations and fans asking him about it more than two years after its completion. The series was collected into a single hardcover volume in July 2011. A signed set of all five issues (second printing of issue 1) was made available in January 2012. Ekedal struggled to complete his portion of the signatures due to a wrist injury. Fialkov hinted at the possibility of a sequel in the letter column of issue five.Echoes #5 In a 2012 interview, Ekedal said it could happen if the hardcover continued to sell, but no project had been started. Plot Brian Cohn, a medicated schizophrenic, visits his dying father (who also has schizophrenia and suffers from Alzheimer's disease) in a hospital. With his final breaths, he tells Brian an address and speaks cryptically about dead girls. Brian investigates the house and discovers a large pile of human bones and a box filled with small dolls made from flesh.Echoes #1 (Dec 2010) Unsure what to do, Brian takes the box back to his home and tells no one. The stress of this discovery aggravates Brian's condition, and he begins to hear voices and hallucinate dead girls. In particular, he hears his father telling him to continue his work. When a young girl Brian sees disappears, he worries that he killed her. When Detective Neville visits Brian to inquire about the girl, Brian lies about seeing another man following her. Later, Brian receives a small package that contains a new doll made from the missing girl.Echoes #2 (Jan 2011) Detective Neville returns and invites Brian to accompany him to arrest a handicapped man matching the description Brian had given. The man happens to have an alibi, but Brian's condition is further aggravated by the stress. After Neville leaves, Brian finds a girl's sneaker under his car's passenger seat.Echoes #3 (Feb 2011) Brian learns of the Alzheimer's symptom Echolalia, and returns to the hospital to research his father's roommate. The roommate used to live in the house in which Brian found the dolls, and the confession Brian's father made was a repetition of the confession his roommate had made to his son, Det Neville.Echoes #4 (Mar 2011) Brian is arrested for the girl's murder, and he is ignored when he tries to implicate Neville. Privately, Neville explains that he was present when Brian found the box and had been hoping they could work together. Brian is committed to a mental institution. As he lies strapped to a bed, a vision of his father leans over him promising to help him escape.Echoes #5 (Apr 2011) Critical reception The series received mostly positive reviews. Greg Burgas of Comic Book Resources praised the series, writing that Fialkov did an excellent job in building tension, and praising Ekedal's black and white art, which he said made the already-dark story feel even more morally ambiguous. Burgas wrote in a December 2010 review: \\"I really can't recommend Echoes enough. ... It's an early contender for best mini-series of 2011.\\" After being nominated for 3 Harvey Awards in 2011, Echoes was nominated for another four in 2012: Best graphic album previously published, Best continuing or limited series, Best Writer, and Best single issue or story (issue 5).2012 Harvey Award nominees announced , www.baltimorecomiccon.com Collected editions The series was collected into a hardcover edition. *Echoes Vol 1 (114 pages, July 2011, ) See also *Elk's Run *I, Vampire *The Last of the Greats References External links * Category:2010 comics debuts Category:Black-and-white media Category:Image Comics limited series Category:Horror comics Category:Top Cow titles ","title":"Echoes (comics)"},{"id":"32973663","text":"Else Marie Sofie Schmitt (May 2, 1921 in Br√ºhl, Germany - March 22, 1995 in Cologne, Germany) was a German politician of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

The campus is located just west of downtown Chicago. Degrees granted by the UIC Liautaud Graduate School of Business include the Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Science in Accounting (MSA), Master of Science in Business Analytics, Master of Science in Finance, and a Master of Science in Management Information Systems (MSMIS). The UIC Liautaud Graduate School of Business is an entity operating alongside the undergraduate programs within College of Business Administration. In 2003, UIC received a $5 million endowment from Jim Liautaud, his wife Gina, and their son, Jimmy John Liautaud, owner and founder of Jimmy John's, to establish the graduate school in the College of Business Administration. Called The Liautaud Graduate School of Business, it was named in their honor. History The UIC MBA was founded in 1977, and the Liautaud Graduate School of Business at UIC was endowed in 2003, named for the Liautaud Family of Chicago. Jim Liautaud, a lifetime member of the University of Illinois Alumni Association, along with his wife Gina, and their son James John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich franchise, provided a generous gift to the college. The Liautaud family is a long time supporter of the College of Business Administration and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Jim and son Jimmy John were founding members of UIC's Family Business Council and both have been inducted to the UIC Entreprepreneurial Hall of Fame. =Douglas Hall= In fall 2011, students in the UIC Liautaud Graduate School of Business began to take the majority of their classes in the newly renovated Douglas Hall. The university commissioned The Architects Enterprise, Ltd. to design the adaptive reuse of Douglas Hall. Construction began in June 2010. The renovation involved gutting the entire structure and removal or precast concrete and glass, as well as the roof. The building provides an ultra-modern environment while preserving the original concept of Walter Netsch's Brutalist design, which defined UIC's campus. The building has been certified Gold by LEED. At a projected cost of $11.7 million, the three-story structure occupies space immediately southeast of University Hall, between Halsted and Morgan streets. The building is flanked by Lincoln Hall and Grant Hall. Interior Architect Harley Ellis Devereaux fitted the 24,000 sq. ft. glass and reinforced concrete structure with modern accents and muted colors. =Douglas Hall Green Technology= *Geothermal Technology A geothermal well is used as a central heating and/or cooling system that pumps heat to or from the ground. It uses the earth as a heat source (in the winter) or a heat sink (in the summer). This design takes advantage of the moderate temperatures in the ground to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems, The earth connection is a series of pipes buried in the ground between Douglas Hall and University Hall. The pipes carry water, which is the medium for heat between the ground and the building. The heat pump removes the heat from the fluid, concentrates it and transfers it to the building. For cooling, the process is reversed. The thermal distribution system consists of conventional ductwork to distribute the heated or cooled air from the pump throughout the building. In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, the old windows were replaced with an insulated glass curtain wall that makes use of daylight. They are covered with temperature-sensitive shades. *Photovoltaic Panels Photovoltaics is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity. Photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material. The photovoltaics on the roof of Douglas Hall were partially funded by a grant from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation. *Post-consumer Content Many of the materials used in the construction of Douglas Hall were made from recycled materials. The floors on the third floor are made from recycled tires, the terrazzo floor on the first level is made from recycled glass and mirrors. The glass curtain wall that wraps around the building is anchored by aluminum made with scrap metal. *Recycled Rainwater The paving stones around the building and in the Faith Dremmer Memorial Garden are used to capture rainwater so that it doesn't flow to the sewer. The layers of sediment and crushed stone underneath the paving stones diverts the rainwater to the native plants and flower surrounding the building.

In the second year, they will pursue advanced electives and complete a concentration. The concentrations guaranteed to be available in the Saturday offering are finance and general management. All of the classes will be offered in the new LEED gold certified Douglas Hall on the UIC campus. =Accelerated One-Year MBA Program= The Accelerated MBA program is a one- year, full-time degree program designed to provide students with 0‚Äì4 years of work experience with all of the requirements for an MBA, including professional development and management skills. Once the core courses are complete, students have the opportunity to choose from one of three specialized areas of study to complete their degree: * Finance * Business analytics * Marketing MIS: Master of Science in Management Information Systems The UIC Liautaud Master of Science in Management Information Systems is an advanced degree in the application of information technology to solve business problems. It is designed to train future CIOs, project managers, and technology leaders in information systems management. Some of the tracks in the program are Business Intelligence Analysis, Health Care and IT, Corporate IT Management, and Business Continuity, Security, and Compliance Risk Planning. A student in the MIS degree program may specialize in technical, managerial, or a combination of the two areas. MIS courses are organized around three disciplines: (1) Service Operations and Supply Chain Management; (2) Enterprise Information Technology and Technology Project Management; and (3) Business Analytics and Data Mining focused on the finance and marketing sectors. The Liautaud MIS courses stress problem-solving skills with a focus on developing students' abilities to frame, analyze and communicate, assuring a high demand for UIC Liautaud graduates in the job market. The MIS degree can be obtained on a part-time or full-time basis and most of the courses are offered in the evening. Applicants with an undergraduate degree in MIS from an accredited institution should be able to complete the program in one year of full-time study. Those with degrees in other fields and without MIS and business preparation should be able to complete the degree in two years of full-time study. MIS degree students must meet both the business and technical background requirements and complete at least 32 semester hours of approved graduate course work. Each prerequisite course may be waived based on equivalent prior coursework or appropriate work experience in the functional area. These courses are prerequisites and will not count towards the minimum degree requirement of 32 hours. Applicants who have not taken all of the prerequisite MIS courses may be admitted on a provisional basis (i.e., with limited rather than full status) and must complete the prerequisites within their first year of enrollment to retain their status in the UIC Liautaud Master of Science program. Accepting limited status is binding on the time to satisfy these requirements.

Released on September 1, 2011, the game is published by Meridian4 for Windows and is distributed online through Steam, Impulse, GamersGate, Direct2Drive, and Amazon Download. The game is set after a fictional World War III in a post-apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which survivors from the war have gathered. The player assumes the role of the eponymous female protagonist, Angel, as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend. The game is played from a bird's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles. The players can find more powerful guns to attach to the car and can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies. The game was the first to be released under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game. Gameplay Angel uses Gypsy's mounted machine guns to destroy enemy vehicles before they escape with enslaved townspeople The story, told through the use of voiced and animated comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire. The game offers four different difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played from the perspective of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it. Plot The game is set after a fictional World War III, the events of which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the survivors have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels from town to town in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas. Shortly after arriving, the city is forced to rally all of its survivors, including Angel and Ekx, in order to fend off an incoming attack from the Renegades. The two friends become separated during the fighting, but not before Ekx gives a mysterious book to Angel. After making her way to the city of Highwall, Angel encounters Wastelanders worshipping a mystic that claims the earth was not destroyed by nuclear war, but by a \\"crack in the universe.\\" Angel is skeptical of these claims, although Ekx believes her to be the deliverer. After receiving a mission from Ekx, Angel heads through the badlands, north, to a survivor camp. Despite rumors that the place may be flooded, the game ends as Angel heads to New York to find out why Ekx has entrusted her with the mysterious book. Development Wasteland Angel was first announced on May 17, 2011, with a prospective release date for summer of the same year. The game was developed by Octane Games, an independent development team in Kotka, Finland that is owned by Nitro Games. The company was founded in Spring 2011, shortly after Nitro Games completed the arcade shooter Woody Two-Legs. Wasteland Angel would be their first release under the Octane Games brand. Before the release, the group had already announced the second game they were working on: a pirate role-playing game titled Raven's Cry. Although Wasteland Angel is published by Meridian4, Raven's Cry was signed to be published by TopWare Interactive. In the announcement for Wasteland Angel, the publisher noted plans to make additional downloadable content available for the game after it was launched. In an August 2011 interview, Octane Games CEO Jussi T√§htinen stated that the company was focusing on multiplatform development and that Wasteland Angel seemed in ideal fit to be marketed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but he declined to share any specific plans to bring the game to either platform. When asked about the possibility of a multiplayer mode, T√§htinen again declined to make any announcement. Release Wasteland Angel was released on September 1, 2011, through online distribution networks: Steam, Impulse, GamersGate, Direct2Drive, and Amazon Download. In a press release for the game, Meridian4's Marketing Director Steve Milburn stated, \\"Much like the Honey Badger, Wasteland Angel is also 'pretty badass' \\" and provided a hyperlink to a satirical YouTube video about the honey badger.The linked YouTube video can be found at \\"The Crazy Nastyass Honey Badger (original narration by Randall)\\". The developers released a demo for the game on September 12 which included four stages with a boss fight. A September 2011 update for the game was also released which included support for dual- monitors, editable key configurations, and more destroyable objects available in the game. Reception Wasteland Angel received average reviews upon release, garnering a rating of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, \\"To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight when I got to see the carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes.\\" Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine did not appear to be designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as \\"more than a little jarring.\\" While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, \\"Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel right at home with the frantic, arcade-style action.\\" Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it \\"the most fun game that I have played this year\\".

Wood was professor, an author of multiple monographs on mathematics and engineering, vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the first president of the American Society for Engineering Education. Biography De Volson Wood, son of Julius and Amanda (Billings) Wood, was born near Smyrna, New York. His studied in a public school, with an additional six weeks in a private academy and two terms in Cazenovia Seminary. In 1849 he began teaching, with which he was occupied until his death, his subsequent education being received while he was himself instructing. He started at Smyrna where he taught for three terms. Desiring to continue his education, he then went to the Albany State Normal School and graduated in 1853. He then obtained his first position as principal, in the Napanoch School, Ulster County, New York. Returning to the closing exercises of the Albany Normal School during a week of vacation, Wood accepted an offer of assistant professorship in mathematics. In 1855, Woods went to study at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, but still did not give up teaching, as the Preparatory Department of the Institute was being organized at that time, and he was asked to teach mathematics there. On graduating with the degree of civil engineer, Woods went west, hoping to obtain a position in Chicago. He stopped for a few days at Detroit and went to see the University of Michigan buildings at Ann Arbor. In a chat after hearing a lecture by President Tappan, Woods was offered professorship in civil engineering, which he accepted and carried for fifteen years. During those years, he received honorary degrees of A.M. and M.Sc. from Hamilton College and the University of Michigan, respectively. He also organized the Department of Civil Engineering. Wood was married in September, 1859, to Cordera E. Crane, who died in June, 1866 leaving one child. In August, 1868, he married Fannie M. Hartson, by whom he had six children. Drawing from the Wood's rock drill patent Wood was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers from 1871 to 1885, and a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) from 1879 to his death. He became vice-president of AAAS in 1885. He was also a member of the American Mathematical Society, an honorary member of the American Society of Architects, a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the first president of the American Society for Engineering Education (1893‚Äì1894). He invented the \\"Wood's Steam Rock-Drill\\" and various other devices and published several dozen books and articles in scientific journals on mathematics, engineering and thermodynamics.

It was made by Commonwealth Pictures, a company formed in October 1920 with Eric Griffin as managing director at a value of ¬£10,000. They hired John K. Wells to direct; he was an American who moved to Australia with Wilfred Lucas to work as an assistant director. The movie was shot in and around Sydney, including at Randwick racecourse and at Camden, with interiors at E. J. Carroll's studio at Palmerston in Waverly. Footage was taken involving an aeroplane, one of the first Australian movies to do so. The champion race horse Kennaquhair appears. Reception Le Maistre Walker, who helped set up Commonwealth Pictures, later claimed the film earned ¬£17,000 in Australasia, of which only ¬£3,900 was returned to the company. The UK rights were sold for ¬£3,000 and the American rights for $16,000. Walker says that the US distributors made ¬£30,000 out of the film. However, because of the associated costs, Commonwealth could only return 23/ of every ¬£1 invested, and soon went out of business. The film was the victim of block booking in the US so was retitled and edited to make it seem as if it was set in Virginia. Wells appears to have never directed another feature film.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 103.

Geography  H√∂sseringen lies between Hamburg and Hanover in the middle of the L√ºneburg Heath. The village is dominated by the landscape of the High Heath (Hohe Heide) and extensive forests that surround it and that stretch as far as Eschede to the southwest. = Geology = Terminal moraines from the penultimate ice age run through the parish forming several hillocks and low ridges. The Hardau stream rises about 2 km southeast of the village centre, running through the Hardau valley between Holxen and Holdenstedt before emptying into the Gerdau.  History  The village was first recorded in 1247.  Culture and sights  = Tourism = The Landtagsplatz Water- treading facility Aside from agriculture, tourism is an important source of income for the village. The village is known nationally for the H√∂sseringen Museum Village which covers an area of about 10 ha. The museum village is also a starting point for the Schooten forest educational trail that runs through the forest of the same name and describes the development of agriculture and forestry in the L√ºneburg Heath at 10 information points. In the immediate vicinity of the museum village is the Landtagsplatz, which was the place of assembly in the Middle Ages (1355-1652) for the provincial parliament or Landtag. The Landtagsplatz consists of numerous glacial erratics that were used as seats for the representatives of the villages in the district of Uelzen. In addition H√∂sseringen is also the starting point for the 26 km long water experience path that runs as far as Uelzen. Stations along the way include the water-treading trough at the village pond and the artificial lake of the Hardausee, near to which there is also a campsite and barbecue area. Another attraction is the observation tower, built in 2003, that is situated between H√∂sseringen and R√§ber. The tower acts simultaneously as a bearer for mobile telephone antennas. There is also a watermill on the Lower Saxon Mill Road near the village centre; although it is no longer in use.  Sources  * Tilman Grottian: Geschichte der Gemeinde Suderburg.

Cohen was considered the country's only serious drama critic during the first two decades following World War II, the period when Canadian theatre became established. He was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, to an Eastern European Jewish immigrant family. He got his start in media when he was the editor of Mount Allison University's student newspaper. After graduating from Mount Allison, he was the editor of the Glace Bay Gazette. He permanently moved to Toronto in 1945 and wrote for various Communist Party supported newspapers. In 1948, he became the Theatre critic for CBC Radio. When CBC began television broadcasts in the 1950s, Cohen became one of their first talk show hosts. He joined The Toronto Daily Star in 1959, and worked as its theatre critic until his death in 1971. Early life Cohen was born and raised in the Whitney Pier section of Sydney, Nova Scotia. His family were Jewish immigrants from Poland (Pale of Settlement) that settled near the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation's steel mill, Atlantic Canada's major steel mill. His parents changed their name to Cohen from Kaplansky when they arrived in Halifax. Cohen had three siblings: two older sisters born in Poland, and a younger brother. Cohen was the first boy and member of his family to be born in Canada. As a child, he read persistently in the backroom of his parents' grocery store, where he developed a love for science fiction, comics, and novels. He graduated from Sydney Academy High School, where he was heavily influenced by one of his English teachers, William Mould, who encouraged him to read Shakespeare. He entered Mount Allison University at age 16, and edited the University's student newspaper and yearbook. Professional career =Glace Bay Gazette= After he graduated from Mount Allison, he studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School for a semester, but returned to Nova Scotia without graduating. He found employment as a journalist, in effect becoming a one-man show, by editing, reporting, typesetting and publishing the Glace Bay Gazette, a union-owned mass-published daily newspaper from 1942 to 1945. =Labor-Progressive Party= He joined the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party was known) and moved to Toronto in 1945 and worked for the party paper, Canadian Tribune and Vochenblatt, a Yiddish communist weekly newspaper, as editor of its English-language section writing political articles, book reviews and then theatre reviews. Joe Gershman, the editor of the Vochenblatt, later stated of Cohen's Communist affiliation: \\"During the years he was a member, he was a rebel against certain postulates held by the party. He was not in favor of democratic centralism, particularly in the matter of art. He felt a writer should be given a chance to explore and write freely what he thinks and sees, rather than follow the party line. Nathan was, in nature, a rebel, even. when he was in the Communist Party.\\" Cohen likely quit the party around 1947. =CBC Radio and Television= He came to the attention of Mavor Moore who recommended Cohen to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation where, as a theatre critic, he hosted Across the Footlights, The Theatre Week and CJBC Views the Shows. Cohen received national prominence as host of Fighting Words, an intellectual, but popular panel show on CBC Television from 1953 to 1962. Cohen also worked for CBC Television in the 1950s as a script editor for the anthology series General Motors Presents and continued with CBC Radio conducting interviews on the show Audio. =Toronto Telegram and Toronto Daily Star= In the 1950s, he also published his own magazine, The Critic. Cohen began writing a theatre column for the Toronto Telegram in 1957 and was hired away by the Toronto Daily Star two years later, becoming the paper's entertainment editor and remaining there until his death. Cohen was known for his integrity as a critic and did not hesitate to give negative reviews, breaking with the common critical practices of the time which consisted mostly of uncritical praise. He was asked by the Canadian University Press to come up with tips for aspiring arts critics and he turned that into a Toronto Star column \\"Rules for budding critics\\" in 1964. Late career and death In his later years, he suffered from heart disease caused by diabetic complications, and died at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, a few hours after having open heart surgery in the early hours of 26 March 1971.

He was the son of David Crosbie, High Sheriff of Kerry, and his wife Jane Hamilton, daughter of William Hamilton of Lisclooney, County Offaly, and grandson of Sir Thomas Crosbie, also High Sheriff of Kerry, and his wife Bridget Tynte. His father and grandfather both opposed the Glorious Revolution, and thereafter lived quietly on their County Kerry estates; Maurice's election to the House of Commons in 1713 marked the family's return to political prominence. The Crosbie family were of Gaelic and Catholic origin, but Maurice's ancestor John Crosbie converted to the Church of Ireland in the reign of Elizabeth I and was made Bishop of Ardfert. His descendants became substantial landowners in Kerry: the senior branch of the family were the Crosbie baronets, the last of whom, Sir Edward Crosbie, was executed for treason as a United Irishman in 1798. Maurice was educated at Trinity College in Dublin. He was knighted in approximately 1711. In 1713 he was elected to the Irish House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Kerry.E. M.

Marriage and children He married Lady Elizabeth Fitzmaurice, daughter of Thomas FitzMaurice, 1st Earl of Kerry and Anne Petty. They had seven children, including William Crosbie, 1st Earl of Glandore, Maurice Crosbie, Dean of Limerick, father of the 4th and last Baron Brandon, Mary Ann, who married John Coppinger of Glenville, County Cork and was the mother of Maurice Coppinger, Elizabeth, who married Lancelot Crosbie, and Jane, who married Thomas Mahon and was the mother of Maurice Mahon, 1st Baron Hartland.

The series spanned 14 chapters that in three tank≈çbon volumes. The sequel, Koi Dano Ai Dano, has been serialized from 2009 to 2016. It was licensed for English release by Tokyopop but was dropped after 2 volumes due to Tokypop's bankruptcy.  Plot  Kanoko Naedoko is a third year middle school student who likes to be alone and keeps to herself. She watches her classmates from the sidelines, and is what she calls herself an \\"observer\\". Steamy love triangles, school gossip and courtyard politics only mean more data for Kanoko! But when she befriends some of her classmates, what will happen to Kanoko? Will she become more than just an observer?  Characters  ; :The main character of the series. Kanoko prefers to be alone and enjoys being the 'class observer', writing down all her observations in a notebook. She has a very straightforward personality, telling people exactly whats on her mind whether it upsets them or not. She's a very strong character who doesn't give into bully, even deriving amusement from it. She is adept at reading people and interpreting their motives, but only when it relates to other people. If it is in relation to herself, she is not nearly as accurate due to her fixed perception of her own identity. For example, she will assume that no one would harbor any romantic interest in her. In spite of her assertion that she is a loner and strictly an observer, she embroils herself in much of what happens at her schools, directing events for her own amusement, even going so far as to become friends with three of the most popular kids in her first school. That said, she is not a malicious person and the results are typically beneficial for those involved. As of late, it has been hinted that Tsubaki harbors feelings for Kanoko, but Kanoko herself is not aware of it for she is positive nobody could ever harbor feelings for her. Even though she looks plain, Tsubaki and Yabuki were attracted to her. She soon realized her feelings for Tsubaki and enters a relationship with him. At the end of manga, it's been implied she marries Tsubaki and has a child with him. ; :A classmate at Kanoko's (99th) previous school. He is the most popular boy in the class in spite (or because) of his aloof personality. He paid Kanako little attention until she approached him under fabricated pretenses. Her response to his rejection was very unexpected and had developed such an interest in her unique personality that he visits her at every new school she goes to (under equally fabricated or weak pretenses) and helps her when she needs help in whatever the circumstance is. He develops romantic feelings for her, but she misinterprets this as strong platonic friendship. ; :Also known as \\"Momo\\". She is simple-minded, cheerful and easygoing and the most popular girl in her school. She is also bullied by the other girls who are nice to her in person but are jealous of her popularity with boys. She has a crush on Tsubaki and initially talks to Kanoko because she was the only one Tsubaki showed any interest in. Unlike the other girls, Kanoko is blunt and honest to the point of rude. She takes her criticism to heart and continues to interact with her. After Kanoko witnesses the bullying and defends Momoka (in her own unique way), Momoka's affection for Kanoko becomes greater than her affection for Tsubaki. Likewise, Kanoko realizes that Momoka has no ulterior motive for friendship and considers Momoka her best friend. Although Momoka initially harbored feelings for Tsubaki, it seems that she treasures her friendship with Kanoko much more although it is not certain if she still harbors feelings for Tsubaki. ; :A friend of Kanoko, Momoka and Tsubaki. He's friendly and outgoing and is the second most popular guy in the school. He has a crush on Momoka, but is too shy to admit his feelings. He is almost the opposite of Kanoko, oblivious to people's motives and true feelings due to his own naivety. He takes things at face value, something that annoys Tsubaki, so Tsubaki annoys him in turn by flirting with Momoka. He is the catalyst to Tsubaki and Momoka's friendship with Kanoko. He helped her pick up her observation notebook and happened to see the contents. He accepted her hasty and poorly thought out explanation without question, which led to Kanoko trying to dissect his personality, which in turn led her talking to Tsubaki so she could compare personalities. ; :Classmate at Kanoko's 100th middle school. Marine pretends to be a humble and sweet girl, but the truth, she is derisive and manipulative. She pretended to be Kanoko's friend when her loner tendencies caused problems for the teacher, but they came to a mutual agreement when Kanoko revealed that she knew her true personality already. She was later betrayed by said teacher and when Kanoko sabotaged him (albeit for her own reasons), she regarded Kanoko as a real friend. ; :Classmate at Kanoko's 101st middle school. She had a crush on the student council president and secretly left helpful notes and refreshment for him, but one of the more popular girls claimed she did it and the two began dating. Sachiko was incensed by this and wrote out a revenge plan in her notebook. After Kanoko transferred in, they swapped notebooks by accident and Sachiko attempted to blackmail Kanoko into helping her. Though she was not at all swayed by the threat, she was overpowered by her desire to observe the results. While they are ultimately successful, Sachiko finds the results aren't completely palatable and goes to Kanoko for help. However, Kanoko refuses to do so, knowing that this would happen and only participated to enjoy the show. ; :One of the people Kanoko meets at her 102nd middle school. She is upbeat and considers herself an \\"art genius\\", but in truth is self- absorbed and desires attention more than artistic expression. Ultimately, this alienates her from the rest of her class. Rather than becoming depressed, she insists that she and Kanoko should be friends, due to the fact that no one could understand her lonely perception of the world better than the \\"tortured art genius\\". Though Kanoko finds her obnoxious, her desire to observe her wins out. ; :Kyoko first appeared in Koi Dano Ai Dano. She is a member of the Newspaper Club. She met Kanoko when Kanoko accidentally fell in a hole she made to catch a Tsuchinoko. Kanoko helps her club out of getting disbanded. ; :Kaede first appeared in Koi Dano Ai Dano. She is The younger sister Of Yabuki You, Who is the student council president. She is a part of the Student Council and the Musical Club. ; :He is kaede's older brother and is in the student Council with his Sister. He Often argues with his over a lot of things, like how He promised Kaede that he would not disband the Newspaper club if they make a big scoop and he said I might have said that and she yelled at him.

Before moving to Arizona, Bill was a rustler in the Indian Territory where he worked with the Dalton Gang. In 1898 the Smith brothers were living with their mother and sisters at a ranch located near the Blue River in northeastern Graham County, Arizona. That year the brothers were arrested for stealing unbranded calves from ranchers Henry Barrett, a former Rough Rider, and Bill Phelps. Bill assumed full responsibility for the crime so his brothers were released. Bill spent the next several months in jail at St. Johns and he was said to have developed a grudge against Henry Barrett. Eventually Bill planned to make his escape from police custody. The jailer at St. Johns, Tom Berry, found Bill to be such a hard sleeper that it was necessary to enter his cell every morning to wake him up. One morning when Berry walked into the cell, Bill Smith revealed a .45 caliber revolver which had been smuggled to him by his brother Al. Bill then locked Berry in the cell and escaped to New Mexico Territory for a year. By 1900 the gang was well known in the Southwest for their thievery along the Mogollon Rim. =Battleground Gunfight= In the first week of October 1901, the gang was spotted near Springerville with fifteen to twenty stolen horses. According to informants, the group was on their way home from Utah where they allegedly robbed a train. A few days later Henry Barrett, in company with another cowboy, were confronted by Bill Smith and his brother Al in the Big Cienega range. During which Henry Barrett was held captive for some time and Bill threatened to kill him but eventually Barrett was released and he informed the local sheriff at St. Johns. On the next day the sheriff organized a posse to go after the Smith Gang. It was to be led by his deputy, Hank Sharp, who would ride with Henry Barrett and two other ranchers. At Greer the posse met up with the Arizona Rangers Carlos Tofolla and Duane Hamblin who were also looking for the Smiths. The two forces decided to combine their strength and they followed the outlaws' trail to a crossing at the Little Colorado River. There they decided to detour east to the ranch of Lorenzo Crosby to ask for his help in pursuing the gang, to which Crosby agreed. The brothers Arch and William \\"Bill\\" Maxwell also lived on the Crosby ranch and they were considered to be great at tracking, both of them joined the posse as well. After that the lawmen continued on the outlaws trail which led to their camp, just within the western border of the Fort Apache Reservation. The camp was located along a creek, within a deep canyon, near the Black River, and the posse confronted the gang from the canyon's western opening on the afternoon of October 8. In the gunfight that followed, the posse had to fire into the setting sun while the position of the outlaws was shaded. Initially the rangers Tofolla and Hamblin demanded that the gang surrender, Bill Smith replied that he would, but when Bill made his appearance, he opened fire with his rifle. The first three shots fired by Bill Smith hit Tofolla twice in the chest and the deputized rancher Bill Maxwell in the head. Maxwell died instantly but Tofolla returned fire with his revolver. For the next couple of hours the two sides skirmished until it was too dark to continue fighting. Tofolla later died that night and he and Bill Maxwell were the only casualties on the posse's side. One or two of the gang members may have been wounded by Barrett who carried a Spanish Mauser that could shoot through trees. During the gunfight, Ranger Duane Hamblin scattered the gang's horses which forced them to have to retreat from the canyon on foot. The posse did not pursue any further though so the Smith Gang escaped to New Mexico and then Texas, stealing horses, guns, and food, from settlers, along the way. Another posse was organized to go after the Smith Gang, and the United States Army dispatched two Apache Scouts, Chicken and Josh, to help in the search, but the scouts lost the outlaws' trail at the Rio Grande, the international border between Texas and Mexico. Following this the Smith Gang ceased to exist as a criminal enterprise in the United States but they may have continued their life of crime in Mexico. Bill Smith and his brother Al made their way to Galveston, Texas, where they took a boat to Argentina. Bill Smith later returned to Douglas, Arizona, where he became involved in a gunfight with policeman Tom Vaughn and Ranger Dayton Graham. Smith managed to escape after severely injuring both men. After Dayton recovered he spent several months tracking down Smith in Southern Arizona. In 1902, Dayton found Smith in a saloon at a monte table in Douglas, Arizona, and killed him.Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters by Bill O'Neal, p. 290 George Smith returned to Arizona in 1909 and surrendered himself to Sheriff Jim Parks of Graham County. However, since the only charges against him had been filed in Apache County, he was released from custody and returned to his mother's ranch on the Blue River.

He belongs to the Thiyyar community in Kadathanad North Malabar, South India. According to the ballads, Chandu was a Chekavar (warrior), like his cousins Aromal Chekavar and Unniyarcha. Chandu Chekavar secretly hated Aromal's family because his love for Unniyarcha was spurned. This leads to him taking part as Aromal's helper in a duel (\\"Ankam\\") with Aringodar Chekavar. Chandu chekavar allies with Aringodar chekavar and sabotages Aromal's sword by replacing the metal rivets holding the blade to the hilt with wooden ones. During the duel the blade get separated but Aromal picks up the blade and throws it at Aringoder killing him. After that Aromal won, Chandu takes matters into his own hands and unexpectedly stabs his cousin to death. Henceforth, the word Chathiyan, meaning \\"Betrayer\\", is added to his name to indicate his infamy. Unniyarcha, herself a warrior and Aromal's sister, vows revenge for her brother's life. Revenge is finally achieved when her son Aromal Unni Chekavar challenges Chandu to a duel and kills him.

History The Mandrake Memorial formed in late 1967 when producer/promoter Larry Schreiber was asked to put together a house band for Manny Rubin's downtown Philadelphia club, The Trauma. Schreiber started with Michael Kac (pronounced \\"Katz\\"), a folksinger/guitarist/banjoist/keyboardist who was already a regular performer at both The Trauma and Rubin's other club, The Second Fret. Kac had been in a band called The Candymen, later known as Cat's Cradle, recently broken up (Schreiber had been their manager). Guitarist Kim King (of Lothar and the Hand People, another Trauma Club regular) told Schreiber about a drummer he knew in a similar situation. J. (John) Kevin Lally was from a band called The Novae Police, a fixture at the Night Owl Club and The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, playing with bands like The Flying Machine (with James Taylor) and The Ragamuffins (from Canada). Schreiber visited Lally in the basement of New York's Albert Hotel, where Kevin kept his drums in Lothar's practice room. Suitably impressed, he brought Lally back to Philadelphia to meet Michael, and the two musicians hit it off immediately. Kac then recruited a young guitarist he'd seen, Craig Anderton from a University of Pennsylvania college band called The Flowers of Evil, who'd been opening for Todd Rundgren's first band Woody's Truck Stop.http://www.craiganderton.com/ Last, Lally convinced his friend Randy Monaco, bassist/vocalist from The Novae Police, to relocate to Philly and join them. Although everyone was already working musicians, they jumped at the chance to be a house band, with a guaranteed gig every weekend and the chance to open for all the big-name bands brought in by Manny.Mandrake Memorial CD liner noteshttp://psychedelic- rocknroll.blogspot.com/2009/06/mandrake-memorial-1968-monaco-kac.html The Mandrake Memorial quickly gelled and began developing a following. At the beginning they were a standard two-guitar, bass & drums quartet, but very soon a sales rep from R.M.I.http://www.michaelkac.com/kidrocksout.html approached the group with a prototype of what was to become their Rock-Si-Chord (an electronic harpsichord). The band tried it out and quickly realized it gave them a new sound nobody else had. Since Kac was the only band member who could play keyboards, he switched from guitar to harpsichord and Mandrake was complete. The new sound was an immediate success. The band was widely acknowledgedhttp://www.geosound.org/michaelkac.htm as \\"blowing off the stage\\" many of the headline acts they were supposed to be supporting. Mandrake opened for The Doors, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention, Moby Grape, and Strawberry Alarm Clock, among others, and appeared on TV with Pink Floyd.http://www.geosound.org/michaelkac.htm Soon Mandrake was performing college circuit clubs like Boston Tea Party, Psychedelic Supermarket, Electric Circus, New York's Cafe Au Go Go, the Second Fret and The Main Point. Manny Rubin got them signed to Poppy Records,http://www.bsnpubs.com/mgm/poppy.html the new experimental music label of MGM Records. Their first self-titled LP, produced by Tony Camillo and Tony Bongiovi (cousin of Jon Bon Jovi), sold over 100,000 copies, mainly in the Philadelphia, New York and Boston areas. A second LP, Medium was completed in early 1969 to similar high acclaim. Kac (and his Rock-Si-Chord) left the band following Medium, citing musical differences, and in the summer of 1969 the remaining trio traveled to England to record a live-in-the-studio acoustic album with famed producer Shel Talmy. Booked to tour the U.K. with Todd Rundgren's new band The Nazz, unfortunately an English union disagreement prevented any American musicians from performing that summer. To top that off, their completed \\"Mandrake Unplugged\\" album was deemed too uncommercial by Poppy label executives and never released ‚Äî although the idea was to become a huge trend two decades later. This 'lost' album was finally released on the Flashback label in 2016, titled 3 Part Inventions. Returning to Philadelphia, the band began working on a new album, re-working some of the songs from their failed acoustic album. They were teamed up with New York producer Ronald Frangipane with the result that he brought in an orchestra and filled out the songs with full choir, children's choir, orchestral splashes and elaborate production. Puzzle was a progressive rock masterpiece, but did not sell well enough to make back its considerable production costs. It did garner critical praise, however. \\"The idea they have is very great,\\" wrote classical conductor Seiji Ozawa in the May 23, 1970 edition of Billboard magazine. \\"I love this recording. With some recordings, I can listen to only one selection, but this recording I love to hear from the very beginning, from the first note to the last.\\" Fusion, a major rock music publication at the time, added that it was \\"a symphony of the mind; one of the most important albums of the decade to come.\\" The band recorded just one more single, a cover of Thunderclap Newman's \\"Something In The Air\\" backed with an original tune by Anderton. When the single also flopped, Lally left the band and Anderton and Monaco soon called it quits. =Post breakup activities= After disbanding Mandrake, Craig Anderton teamed up with Charles Cohen and Jefferson Cain to form an electronic trio called Anomaly. Their only recorded legacy is the musical backing and production credits on three LPs by Philadelphia acoustic guitarist (and guitar teacher) Linda Cohen (no relation to Charles), Leda (1971), Lake of Light (1972) and Angel Alley (1973). In the early 1980s Charles Cohen and Jeff Cain went on to record and perform as The Ghostwriters (one LP, Objects In Mirrors Are Closer Than They Appear, 1981http://www.discogs.com/Ghostwriters-Objects- In-Mirrors-Are-Closer-Than-They-Appear/release/1402319 and a cassette Remote Dreaming, 1986http://www.discogs.com/Ghostwriters-Remote- Dreaming/release/3802176). Even during Mandrake Anderton invented several guitar effects pedals, synthesizer modules and a programmable electronic drum machine, projects which he documented in a long series of well-known DIY books for musicians beginning with \\"Electronic Projects for Musicians\\" (1975). He wrote extensively for several music industry publications including Synapse and Keyboard Magazine, and was the editor of Electronic Musician magazine 1980-1990. His circuits appear in products from such manufacturers as TASCAM, Peavey Electronics, PAiA Electronics, Steinberg and Kurzweil Music Systems. He produced and guested on dozens of albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He released a solo album on cassette in 1977 and another (Forward Motion) on CD in 1989. He released Simplicity (with a Christian theme) and Neo-Psychedelic Music for the 21st Century both in 2017, and Joie de Vivre in November 2018. He remains active as a producer, engineer, musician and consultant.http://www.craiganderton.com During spring and summer of 1969, Michael Kac worked in a guitar/harpsichord duo with Linda Cohen. As classically trained musicians, both hoped to forge a new synthesis of popular and classical forms, which is evident in her albums.http://www.michaelkac.com/kidrocksout.html Already a graduate student in Linguistics, in 1971 Kac moved to Los Angeles to take his Ph.D at UCLA, then joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. He formally studied the harpsichord 1971-1983 and gives occasional solo and ensemble recitals.http://www.michaelkac.com/academic.html In 1998 he reunited with Linda Cohen and Craig Anderton to record Naked Under the Moon.http://www.kac-cohen.com/ Linda died in January 2009http://www.myspace.com/lindacohen of lung cancer.http://articles.philly.com/2009-01-28/news/25279050_1_classical- guitarist-teaching-guitar-new-music Kevin Lally traveled to England in 1970, where his family originated, and ended up apprenticing at Lloyd's of London in ship insurance. Returning to New York in 1980, he founded Seahawk International, Inc. which became the largest privately held aviation and maritime insurance broker in New York. He was also the chairman on the restoration of Wavertree, the largest iron sailing vessel afloat.

Jeffrey R. Hayes, professor of art history at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, described him as \\"among the best self-taught artists ever to come out of Milwaukee\\". Life Born on 20 April 1921, Blackmon grew up in Albion, Michigan. His mother, Gussie Blackmon, a devout Baptist, was originally from Macon, Georgia. His father, Dan Blackmon was from Selma, Alabama. They moved north as part of the Great Migration of African Americans out of the Southern United States to seek better jobs and to escape racism and prejudice in the South. According to Blackmon's sister, Lyla M.Washington, their parents arrived in Albion on October 13, 1912, \\"a young teen-age husband and wife\\". They eventually had twelve children, seven girls and five sons. The family lived on a small farm near Albion in a five-room house built by Dan Blackmon. Blackmon has said that when he was eight he predicted the death of a neighbour after hearing her \\"death rattle\\". Blackmon left Washington Gardner High School in Albion in 1937 in the tenth grade to look for work together with his father. He tamped stone and laid track for the New York Central Railroad and then worked for a short period at Albion Malleable Iron Works, the largest factory in Albion. He served with the U.S. Army 585th Engineers Company from 1943 to 1945 during World War II, mostly in the Pacific Theater (New Guinea, Southern Philippines, Luzon). He received six bronze battle stars and several campaign ribbons. The war shaped his religious outlook and he turned to prayer during the heat of battle. He said \\"I learned to pray during the Second World War. When the Japanese planes came over, I'd say: 'Lord, if you get me over this hill, I'll get over the next one myself.'\\" He moved to Chicago and opened a shoeshine stand near the Christian Hope Missionary Baptist Church. He claims to have been cured of acute chronic gastritis after the preacher said that God would heal anyone in the congregation if had faith in his divine power. Blackmon married twice, his first wife died in childbirth, and he separated from his second wife. In 1974, he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and settled there where he ran his own small laundry and tailoring businesses including the Revival Center Shoe Repair and Shine Parlor in the Sydney Hih building. Works =Materials and themes= Blackmon created large handwritten signs which he displayed to warn society of the consequences of sinning. Using house paint, he increasingly embellished his signs with imagery including biblical scenes and symbols of deliverance and retribution, along with visual commentary on social marginalization. Over time his signs became more focused on imagery than words, with words still being an integral part but usually confined to a border.Outsider Art Sourcebook ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.48 =Exhibitions and collections= In 1999, the Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art, Marquette University, organized the solo exhibition Signs of Inspiration : The Art of Prophet William J. Blackmon, the artist's first museum retrospective. The exhibition was curated Jeffrey R. Hayes and included representative works from all periods of his career with all of the works coming from Paul and Jeanne Phelps' collection of Blackmon's paintings. Blackmon worked with the organizers and catalogue authors. The exhibition traveled to three additional venues; the Diggs Gallery, Winston-Salem State University, City Museum in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Brauer Museum of Art in Valparaiso, Indiana.Carter (1999) In 2007, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee Union Art Gallery hosted Meditations & Revelations: The Work of Lauren Grossman & Prophet William Blackmon, an exhibition of Blackmon's work intermingled with pieces by Seattle-based artist Lauren Grossman, whose work addresses the \\"meanings of Judeo/Christian imagery in contemporary culture\\". The show included a screening of the documentary God's Spaceship: A Conversation with Prophet William Blackmon. Blackmon's paintings are in the collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, the American Folk Art Museum in New York, and the Milwaukee Art Museum. His works are on permanent display at both the Center Street Library and the East Library in Milwaukee. Notes References  * Further reading * *Raw Vision, T.L.

It serves the taluk and the adjoining areas of Ambur.  History  J. Deoderlein, a Christian missionary from the United States, offered such a comprehensive care in Ambur as early as 1907. A bullock cart was used to provide medical services to the areas surrounding Ambur which was used as a mobile clinic. Later in 1921, a 16-bedded Hospital was started by the efforts of Dr. Th. Doederlein, an eminent Chicago physician and Two American trained nurses, Miss. Angela Rehwinkel and Miss. Etta Herold. This spark was slow but steady which in later 1986, with a dedicated team of doctors from CMCH Vellore led by Dr A S FENN was envisaged as a multispeciality hospital providing secondary level health care to majority of poor and middle class society in and around Ambur without discrimination of caste, creed and religion. Bethesda Hospital is situated in Ambur town, with a population of more than one lakh and is surrounded by approximately 60 village hamlets. The hospital housed in a campus area of 35 acres serves the health need of very large segment of the rural populations. Patients come from the nearby larger towns such as Vaniyambadi, Pernambut, Gudiyattam, Jolarpet, Natrampalli and Tirupattur. People from socially backward areas from districts like Salem, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Kuppam also benefit from this hospital. Also service through community Health Programmes at Nayakkaneri and Kattukollai ‚Äì hill stations reach the people from the interior.  Background  Bethesda comes from a Hebrew word meaning ‚ÄúHouse of Mercy‚Äù. In Jewish belief, it was a name given to a pool, that when stirred by an angel produced ailment to those who first entered it thereafter. Miss. Angela Rehwinkle and Dr. Dodelein, who founded the hospital chose the name 'Bethesda' to signify the healing that would take place at this hospital. During the early years, Miss. Angela Rehwinkle managed the hospital by her. Subsequently, dedicated doctors Mr. J.C. Williams, Mr. Kalyan, Mr. Eapen Benjamin and Mr. Nallathambi adjoined her for this noble cause. In 1950 Dr.W.F.Bulle a surgeon, through his services enlisted the support of the Wheat Ridge Foundation to sponsor a Tuberculosis control project within the municipal limits of Ambur. The Ambur municipality donated Rs.1,00,000 towards this tuberculosis project. A Leprosy programme was started in the outskirts of Ambur serving up to Pallikonda. This was started with 4 paramedical workers and financial support from the German Leprosy Relief Association (GLRA) based in Chennai. After years of services, Dr. A.S. Fenn, a surgeon, together with a team of physicians notably Dr. Malati Jadhav, an eminent pediatrician, transformed this traditional mission hospital into multispeciality Health Care Center.  Infrastructure  The hospital being multi speciality caters to various medical needs of the people including General Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Orthopedic Surgery, Pediatric Surgery, Neuro surgery, Anaesthesia, Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology, Radiology, Dentistry, Physiotherapy and Dietary departments. Laboratory services including Biochemistry, Microbiology and Clinical Pathology and Pharmacy services are available to the access round the clock. Dialysis Unit, HIV/AIDS Care and Support Programmes further add significance for this centre. Trauma Care Unit are available 24 hours. Medical Records Department streamline the patients to the respective departments for immediate action. Apart from this Blood bank is operational. Proposed additions include setting up of Corporate cell, \\"Golden Hour\\" Mobile Coronary Care Unit and installation of CT scan facilities.  Community health and development  Bethesda Hospital's community health programs are innumerable. It has been the tradition of this hospital since its inception to arrange community health programs. Many such programs have been and now sponsored by various Governments. Some of them include: * Family Planning * Infant Care Programme * Leprosy Control Programme * Tuberculosis Control Programme * Urban Community Health Programmes * Rural Community Health Programmes * Blood bank * Integrated Child Care Project (ICCP) * The Community Care Project * The Care and Treatment programme of APAC * Integrated Counseling and Testing Center (ICTC) * Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission Out of the above, Leprosy Control Programme and Tuberculosis Control Programme were mainly taken care by the Bethesda Hospital. Cases with deformity in Leprosy are referred to the hand surgery to the Schefflin Research Hospital at Karigiri.  Bethesda School of Nursing  Village Health Station, Vinnamangalam The School of Nursing was started in 1997 with an intake of 20 students every year with the recognition from Indian Nursing Council. Diploma course in general nursing and midwifery is offered in this school. The students of this school are actively involving in Community Health Programmes in the surroundings rural villages and urban slums. Regular visits, ante-natal and post natal care to the mothers, referral services, counseling, periodical medical camps, awareness camps, immunization camps, and training of volunteers in the community are taken care by the students. They have also adopted a village nearby named Vinnamangalam. Around 200 students have completed and got placements in different places in this country and abroad.

Description The base is anchored in holes in the rock and is a little wider than the column. This is smooth and firm, extending to a length several times its width, and covered in sticky suckers on its upper part. The usually flat oral disc is finely patterned and surrounded by four or five rings of numerous short tentacles, the longest ones being nearest the mouth. This is raised on a slight mound at the centre of the disc. The general colour is varying sombre shade of olive green or brown with vertical striations on the column. The radial striations on the oral disc are finely patterned in grey, white and black and the tentacles are translucent and banded in white and grey. At the base of each tentacle there is a distinctive black mark shaped like a Roman capital letter \\"B\\".Sagartia troglodytes Philip Henry Gosse. A history of the British sea-anemones and corals. Retrieved 2011-09-03. Pieces of gravel and fragments of shell are often stuck to the upper part of the column. In size, the column can grow to a diameter of an inch (2.5 cm) and a length of two inches (5 cm) but most specimens are much smaller than this.John Barrett & C. M. Young (1958). Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore. p. 59. Distribution and habitat S. troglodytes is found in coastal regions of the north east Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It is common round the coasts of Britain between the tide marks but is relatively little observed because it is well camouflaged and is often hidden in cracks, under overhangs, in rock pools, under seaweed, among mussels or half buried in sand and mud with just its tentacles projecting. In Morecambe Bay, England, it is found anchored to stones buried several inches beneath the surface of this expanse of mudflats, or sometimes not even attached at all but living freely. It can retract into a spherical form when disturbed and no longer be visible from the surface. Biology Like other sea anemones, S. troglodytes is a carnivore and feeds on small invertebrates which it traps with its tentacles and channels into its mouth. Any undigested pieces are expelled from the mouth over the period of a few hours or days. S. troglodytes is a hermaphrodite with gonads inside the body cavity. The eggs are discharged from the mouth, being wafted out individually by cilia on the tentacles. The sperm are produced separately also emanating from the mouth when they give the appearance of a white plume being liberated into the water column. The fertilised egg develops into a planula larva which becomes part of the zooplankton and later settles and develops into a new individual. The species can also reproduce asexually by the liberation of \\"ciliated germs\\" through the walls of the lower column.

Dirac gives an account of quantum mechanics by \\"demonstrating how to construct a completely new theoretical framework from scratch\\"; \\"problems were tackled top-down, by working on the great principles, with the details left to look after themselves\\". It leaves classical physics behind after the first chapter, presenting the subject with a logical structure. Its 82 sections contain 785 equations with no diagrams.

History The first and second editions of the book were published in 1930 and 1935. In 1947 the third edition of the book was published, in which the chapter on quantum electrodynamics was rewritten particularly with the inclusion of electron-positron creation. In the fourth edition, 1958, the same chapter was revised, adding new sections on interpretation and applications. Later a revised fourth edition appeared in 1967. Beginning with the third edition (1947), the mathematical descriptions of quantum states and operators were changed to use the Bra‚Äìket notation, introduced in 1939 and largely developed by Dirac himself Laurie Brown wrote an article describing the book's evolution through its different editions, and Helge Kragh surveyed reviews by physicists (including Heisenberg, Pauli, and others) from the time of Dirac's book's publication.

The house was decorated by David and Alice as a total work of art to present their art collection in a rich Art Deco interior. The house is surrounded by gardens designed by Jules Buyssens in 1925 and Ren√© Pech√®re in 1968 and 1970. The private house became a museum in 1975 according to the testament of Alice Van Buuren. It was declared a National Heritage Site in 2001. History David Van Buuren (1886‚Äì1955) was born into a Jewish family in Gouda, Netherlands. He settled in Brussels in 1909 to become an important private banker. He married the Belgian Alice Piette (1890‚Äì1973) in 1922. David Van Buuren asked his nephew and architect Johan Franco to start working on the plan of his future house in Brussels. From 1924‚Äì1928, the Van Buurens commissioned the Belgian architects L√©on Govaerts and Alexis Van Vaerenbergh to build their house on L√©o Errera Avenue in Uccle following Franco's sketches. The outdoor architecture is typical of the Amsterdam School, while its Art Deco interior was decorated by Belgian, French and Dutch designers with rare furniture, carpets and stained-glass windows. From 1928 to 1970, the Van Buurens hosted people such as Raoul Dufy, Jacques Pr√©vert, Ren√© Lalique, Sergei Diaghilev, Erik Satie, Ren√© Magritte, David Ben-Gurion. The private house became a museum in 1975 according to the testament of Alice Van Buuren. Collections Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, , oil on wood (), circle of Peter Bruegel the Elder, Museum van Buuren, Brussels, Belgium David Van Buuren decorated his house with paintings from James Ensor, Joachim Patinir, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Hercules Seghers, Pieter Jansz Saenredam, Tsuguharu Foujita, Kees van Dongen, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Fantin-Latour, Rik Wouters, Gustave De Smet, Xavier Mellery en Constant Permeke. David was the patron of Belgian expressionist painter Gustave van de Woestijne. Van Buurens collections consists of 32 paintings of Van de Woestijne. The living room is decorated with a rich collection of modernist carpets designed by the Dutch designer Jaap Gidding and a grand piano made of rosewood designed by Julius Bl√ºthner. Jan Eisenloeffel designed the Art Deco chandelier in the entrance hall. On 16 July 2013, the paintings Shrimps and Shells of Belgian painter James Ensor and The Thinker by Dutch artist Kees Van Dongen and eight small works by old masters were stolen. Garden The gardens are an extension of the house, into which they seem to penetrate. They originally covered 26 ares (100m2) and now cover 1.5 ha. It is divided into three parts: the first one is \\"Picturesque Garden\\" designed by the landscape architect Jules Buyssens in 1924 that recalls the spirit of the Roaring Twenties and represents the geometrical ideas of the Art Deco. The second one, the \\"Labyrinth\\", is inspired by the Song of Salomon and decorated with seven sculptures by the Belgian sculptor Andr√© Willequet in 1968. The third one, \\"Garden of the Hearts\\", was designed by Belgian landscape designer Ren√© Pech√®re in 1970 and brings a touch of romanticism to the park. There is a great harmony of style and time between the J. Buyssens's garden and the Art Deco house. 45 years later, Alice considered Ren√© Pech√®re's gardens as a complement of her villa. This jewel of greenery can be visited all year round.

Chakrabarty was born to Gourikanta Chakrabarty and Sita Devi at Krishnapur kukura village on Damodar River in modern-day Purba Bardhaman district of the Indian state of Paschimbanga (West Bengal). He was sent to a pathshala (traditional village primary school in Bengal) at Rampur. Later he was patronised by Kirtichandra, the Maharaja of Bardhaman. He had four sons: Rampriyo, Ramgopal, Ramgobindo and Ramokrishno. Although he eulogises Dharmathakur in his poem, Chakrabarty was a devotee of Rama. In his version of Dharmamangalkavya, many incidents from the Ramayana and the Bhagavata are also described. Two major tales of Dharmamangalkavya i.e. the tales of Harishchandra and Lausen are told in 24 palas (Cantos) which are further subdivided into 9147 shlokas in his poem.

It is named after the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, a district near the Bastille in the east of Paris, where the battle took place. Details During the period of the Second Fronde, between 1650 and 1653, Louis, the Prince of Cond√©, controlled much of Paris, having allied himself with the Parliament of Paris, which was in open rebellion against the Crown. The French king, Louis XIV had only recently reached the age of majority (on 7 September 1651), and Cond√© still claimed that the nefarious influence of Cardinal Mazarin rendered him incapable of rule.Munck, p.212; Le Bas, p.191. On 2 July 1652, the battle of the Faubourg St Antoine took place just outside the Bastille. Cond√© had sallied out of Paris to prevent the advance of the royalist forces under the command of Turenne.Treasure, p.198. Cond√©'s forces became trapped against the city walls and the Porte St Antoine, which the Parliament refused to open; he was coming under increasingly heavy fire from the Royalist artillery and the situation looked bleak.Sainte-Aulaire, p.195; Hazan, p.14. In a famous incident, La Grande Mademoiselle, the daughter of Gaston, the Duke of Orl√©ans, convinced her father to issue an order for the Parisian forces to act, before she then entered the Bastille and personally ensured that the commander turned the fortress's cannon on Turenne's army, causing significant casualties and enabling Cond√©'s army's safe withdrawal.Sainte-Aulaire, p.195; Hazan, p.14; Treasure, p.198. Later in 1652, Cond√© was finally forced to surrender Paris to the royalist forces in October, effectively bringing the Parisian Fronde to an end: the Bastille returned to royal control. The Fronde in the Provinces, especially around Bordeaux, continued through the summer of 1653, however.Munck, p.212. References Bibliography *Hazan, Eric.

Headquartered in Monrovia, the company provides telephone, Internet, fax and radio services to the Greater Monrovia area. Prior to the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 2007, Libtelco possessed a legal monopoly over the country's fixed line services, and today remains the sole company licensed by the Liberia Telecommunications Authority to provide fixed line telephone services. History Libtelco was founded through the Liberian Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1973 to construct and operate the country's fixed line communications infrastructure and to provide services to residents and businesses. Originally, the corporation was also given exclusive policy setting and regulatory authority over all telecommunications in the country, though these powers were transferred to the newly created Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in 1978. The corporation ceased operations in 1990 following the outbreak of the First Liberian Civil War and the subsequent collapse of the national government. The civil war resulted in much of the corporation's infrastructure being destroyed. Following the end of the Second Liberian Civil War in 2003, the transitional government failed in its attempt to privatize Libtelco. In 2006, the newly elected President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, reactivated Libtelco, appointing a temporary Board of Directors while also ordering the creation of a new telecommunications policy for Liberia. The subsequent Liberia Telecommunications Act of 2007 placed regulatory authority over Libtelco and the Liberian telecommunications industry with the newly created Liberia Telecommunications Authority, while also granting Libtelco the sole license for all fixed line telephone services in the country until 2011. Sirleaf appointed a new board and management team to operate the company in 2007. The government has also stated its intention to privatize the company at some point in the future. Services The civil war resulted in the complete destruction of Liberia's landline infrastructure. As a result, Libtelco has focused on expanding telephone, Internet and fax services through fixed wireless systems. Beginning in 2009, the company began offering services through a new CDMA-2000 1x-EvDO network. Libtelco owns a 20% interest in the Cable Consortium of Liberia, which owns and operates the cable landing point of the ACE cable system in Monrovia, due to be completed in 2012. The company is currently using its existing ownership over cable ducts in the Monrovia area to construct a fiber-optic communications network that will connect to the cable system. Libtelco currently owns thirty communications towers around the country, which it both utilizes in its network and leases to Liberia's four GSM mobile providers.

Aminyl are highly reactive and consequently short lived like most radicals; however, they form an important part of nitrogen chemistry. In sufficiently high concentration, amino radicals dimerise to form hydrazine. While NH2 as a functional group is common in nature, forming a part of many compounds (e.g. the phenethylamines), the radical cannot be isolated in its free form.  History and background  Historically, it is generally accepted that the first free radical was identified by Moses Gomberg in 1900; this radical was triphenylmethyl radical. While in general the use of free radicals in organic transformations is difficult to control, organic syntheses with free radicals began in 1937 with Heyes and Waters. After 1940, deeper insights into the formation, structure and reactions of free radicals showed how to control these reactive species in chemical reactions. However, in the 1970s, Lamb and Julia witnessed the beginning of new synthetic methodologies involving free radicals. Nowadays, free radicals are widely used in synthetic reactions.  Electronic states of amino radical  The amino radical has two characteristic electronic states: The electronic states of the amino radical The more stable electronic state is 2B1 states, where the unpaired electron is in the p-orbital perpendicular to the plane of the molecule (œÄ type radical). The high energy electronic state, 2A1, has the two electrons in the p-orbital and the unpaired electron in the sp2 orbital (œÉ type orbital). Nitrogen centered compounds, such as amines, are nucleophilic in nature, hence, this character is also seen in amino radicals and can be considered to be nucleophilic species.  Spectral properties  The amino radical only exhibits a very low optical absorption in the visible region (Œªmax 530 nm, Œµmax 81 M‚àí1 s‚àí1), while its absorption in the UV (<260 nm) is similar to that of OH. Due to this, it is impractical to determine the rate of reaction of the amino radical with organic compounds by following the decay of the amino radical .  Synthesis  Reaction 1: Formation of amino radical from ammonia Amino radicals can be produced by reacting OH radical with ammonia in irradiated aqueous solutions. This reaction is formulated as a hydrogen abstraction reaction. :NH3 \\\\+ ‚Ä¢OH ‚Üí ‚Ä¢NH2 \\\\+ H2O The rate constant (k1) for this reaction was determined to be 1.0 √ó 108 M‚àí1 s‚àí1, while the parallel reaction of OH with was found to be much slower. This rate was re- determined by using two pulse radiolysis competition methods with benzoate and thiocyanate ions at pH 11.4. A value of k1 = (9 + 1) √ó 107 M‚àí1 s‚àí1 was obtained from both systems. While in acidic solution, the corresponding reaction of ‚Ä¢OH with is too slow to be observed by pulse radiolysis. Reaction 2: Formation of amino radical from hydroxylamine The amino radical may also be produced by reaction of e‚àí(aq) with NH2OH. Several studies also utilized the redox system of TiIII‚ÄîNH2OH for the production of amino radicals using electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and polarography. :TiIII \\\\+ NH2OH ‚Üí TiIV \\\\+ ‚Ä¢NH2 \\\\+ OH‚àí Reaction 3: Formation of amino radical from ammoniumyl Reduction of hydroxylamine by e‚àí(aq) has also been suggested to produce the amino radical in the following reaction. :‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢NH2 \\\\+ H+ The reactivity of the amino radical in this reaction is expected to be pH dependent and should occur in the region of pH 3‚Äì7.  Reactivity  In general, amino radicals are highly reactive and short lived; however, this is not the case when reacted with some organic molecules. Relative reactivities of the amino radical with several organic compounds have been reported, but the absolute rate constants for such reactions remain unknown. In reaction 1, it was hypothesized that the amino radical might possibly react with NH3 more rapidly than OH and might oxidize to produce the amino radical in acid solutions, given that radicals are stronger oxidants than OH. In order to test this, sulfate and phosphate radical anions were used. The sulfate and phosphate radical anions were found to react more slowly with NH3 than does the amino radical and they react with ammonia by hydrogen abstraction and not by electron transfer oxidation. When the amino radical is reacted with benzoate ions, the rate constant is very low and only a weak absorption in the UV spectra is observed, indicating that amino radicals do not react with benzene rapidly. Phenol, on the other hand, was found to react more rapidly with the amino radical. In experiments at pH 11.3 and 12, using 1.5 M NH3 and varying concentrations of phenol between 4 and 10 mM, the formation of the phenoxyl radical absorption was observed with a rate constant of (3 + 0.4) √ó 106 M‚àí1 s‚àí1. This reaction can produce phenoxyl radicals via two possible mechanisms: # Addition to the ring followed by elimination of NH3, or # Oxidation by direct electron transfer Rate constants for reaction of NH2 radicals TABLETable 1: Rate constants for reaction of NH2 radicals. These rate constants for the amino radical reactions were measured in a 1978 study by Neta et al. by following the kinetics of formation of the resultant radicals. The observations were made at the absorption maxima of these radicals. While the amino radical is known to be weakly reactive, the recombination process of two amino radicals appears to be one of the fastest. As a result, it often competes with other NH2 reactions and it follows that reaction mechanism involving the amino radical. :NH2 \\\\+ NH2 ‚Üí N2H4 This reaction is the only pathway for NH2 disappearance, and approaches products faster at low pressure.  Applications and Impact on Human Health  Free nitrogen radical species are generated by the human body by various endogenous systems. A balance between free radicals and antioxidants is crucial for proper physiological function. Free radicals can adversely alter lipids, proteins and DNA and trigger a number of diseases. Free radicals are derived either from normal essential metabolic processes in the human body or from external sources, such as exposure to X-rays, cigarette smoking and industrial chemicals. In cells, free radical formation occurs continuously as a consequence of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. On the other hand, free radicals are very effective in carrying out transformations in highly hindered environments with a high degree of chemoselectivity as they are small and more penetrating than carbanions and carbocations. Therefore, molecules which contain many polar functional groups are tolerated by free radicals. Nitrogen radicals and carcinogenesis Reactive nitrogen species, such as the amino radical, play an important role in carcinogenesis. They induce DNA damage, as the reaction of free radicals with DNA includes strand break base modification and DNA protein cross-links. Hence, it is clear that their presence in biosystems could lead to mutation, transformation, and ultimately cancer. Antioxidants Antioxidants Free radicals Lobo et al., An antioxidant is a molecule stable enough to donate an electron to a free radical and neutralize it, thus reducing its capacity to damage. Some are produced during normal metabolism in the body, while others are found in diet. These antioxidants delay or inhibit cellular damage mainly through their free radical scavenging property, as they can safely interact with free radicals and terminate the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged. There are two principal mechanisms of action of antioxidants: # The first is a chain-breaking mechanism by which the primary antioxidant donates an electron to the free radical present # The second mechanism involves removal of reactive nitrogen species initiators by quenching chain-initiating catalyst. In biological systems, antioxidants exert their effect by different mechanisms including electron donation, metal ion chelation, co-antioxidants, or by gene expression regulation.

Names It was first seen from the air and named Mount Hope by Lincoln Ellsworth during his flights of November 21 and 23, 1935. This mountain is one of three major mountains in Ellsworth's Eternity Range to which he gave the names Faith, Hope, and Charity. The November of the following year the mountain was surveyed and given the name \\"Mount Wakefield\\" by J.R. Rymill of the British Graham Land Expedition.

There are numerous variations of the color violet, a sampling of which are shown below. Variations of the color violet =Variations of spectral violet= Although pure spectrum violet is outside the color gamut of the RGB color space, the three colors displayed below are rough approximations of the range of colors of actual spectral violet, although the accuracy of the approximation can vary depending on the individual's color vision, and on the color rendition of one's computer monitor. Color wheel violet The tertiary color on the HSV color wheel (also known as the RGB color wheel) precisely halfway between blue and magenta is called color wheel violet. This tone of violet‚Äîan approximation of the color violet at about 417 nanometers as plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram‚Äîis shown at right. This tone of violet is actually somewhat toward indigo assuming indigo is accepted as a separate spectrum color, usually quoted as having a range of from about 420 to 450 nanometers. Another name for this color is near violet. Electric violet The color at right, electric violet, is the closest approximation to middle spectrum violet that can be made on a computer screen, given the limitations of the sRGB color gamut. It is an approximation of the color violet at about 400 nanometers as plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram, in the middle of the violet range of from 420 nanometers to 380 nanometers, assuming indigo as a separate spectrum color from 450 to 420 nanometers. Other names for this color are middle violet or simply violet. Vivid violet Displayed at right is the color vivid violet, a color approximately equivalent to the violet seen at the extreme edge of human visual perception. When plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram, it can be seen that this is a hue corresponding to that of a visual stimulus of approximately 380 nm on the spectrum. Thus another name for this color is extreme violet. =Computer web color violets= Web color \\"violet\\" The so-called web color \\"violet\\" is in actuality not really a tint of violet, a spectral color, but is a non- spectral color. The web color violet is actually a rather pale tint of magenta because it has equal amounts of red and blue (the definition of magenta for computer display), and some of the green primary mixed in, unlike most other variants of violet that are closer to blue. This same color appears as \\"violet\\" in the X11 color names. Pigment violet (web color dark violet) The color box at right displays the web color dark violet which is equivalent to pigment violet, i.e., the color violet as it would typically be reproduced by artist's paints, colored pencils, or crayons as opposed to the brighter \\"electric\\" violet above that it is possible to reproduce on a computer screen. Compare the subtractive colors to the additive colors in the two primary color charts in the article on primary colors to see the distinction between electric colors as reproducible from light on a computer screen (additive colors) and the pigment colors reproducible with pigments (subtractive colors); the additive colors are a lot brighter because they are produced from light instead of pigment. Pigment violet (web color dark violet) represents the way the color violet was always reproduced in pigments, paints, or colored pencils in the 1950s. By the 1970s, because of the advent of psychedelic art, artists became used to brighter pigments, and pigments called \\"Violet\\" that are the pigment equivalent of the electric violet reproduced in the section above became available in artists pigments and colored pencils. (When approximating electric violet in artists pigments, a bit of white pigment is added to pigment violet.) =Additional variations of violet= Mauve Mauve (from the French form of Malva \\"mallow\\") is a color that is named after the mallow flower.

In common English usage, purple is a range of hues of color occurring between red and blue.Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1984-- Merriam-Webster Page 957 In color theory, purple colors are any colors on the line of purples on the CIE chromaticity diagram (or colors that can be derived from colors on the line of purples), i.e., any color between red and violet, not including either red or violet themselves. The first recorded use of purple as a color name in English was in 975 AD.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 202 Historical development of purple =Tyrian purple: Classical antiquity= See also under Purple#In_art, history and fashion the section \\"In prehistory and the ancient world: Tyrian purple\\" Byzantine Emperor Justinian I clad in Tyrian purple; 6th-century mosaic in the Basilica of San Vitale \\"Tyrian purple\\" is the contemporary English name of the color that in Latin is denominated \\"purpura\\". Other contemporary English names for purpura are \\"imperial purple\\" and \\"royal purple\\". The English name \\"purple\\" itself originally denominated the specific color purpura. Purpura is the color of a dye extracted from a mollusk found on the shores of the city of Tyre in ancient Phoenicia (contemporarily in Lebanon), which color in classical antiquity was a symbol of royalty and political authority because only the very wealthy could afford it, including the Roman Emperors. Therefore, Tyrian purple was also denominated \\"imperial purple\\". Tyrian purple may have been discovered as early as during the Minoan civilization. Alexander the Great, when giving imperial audiences as the Emperor of Macedonia; the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire; and the Kings of Ptolemaic Egypt all wore Tyrian purple. The imperial robes of Roman emperors were of Tyrian purple trimmed in metallic gold thread. The badge of office of a Roman Senator was a stripe of Tyrian purple on his white toga. Tyrian purple was continued in use by the Emperors of the Eastern Roman Empire until its final collapse in 1453. The tone of Tyrian purple displayed above is that tone of Tyrian purple which was the color of \\"clotted blood\\", which was considered the tone having the most prestige in ancient Greece and Rome, as recorded by Pliny the Elder. However, the actual tone varied depending on how the dye was formulated. Lesser royal houses that wanted to economize could mix Tyrian purple dye with the much less expensive indigo to create a color closer to violet. =Han purple: Ancient China= Han purple and Han blue were synthetic colors made by artisans in China during the Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) or even earlier. Han purple is a type of artificial pigment found in China between 500 BC and AD 220. It was used in the decoration of the Terracotta Army. =Royal purple: 17th century= The color royal purple is shown at right. This tone of purple is bluer than the ancient Tyrian purple. The first recorded use of royal purple as a color name in English was in 1661.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 203; Color Sample of Royal Purple: Page 109 Plate 43 Color Sample K11 In 1990, royal purple was formulated as one of the Crayola crayon colors. =Mauveine: 1860s‚Äì1890s= Professor Charles Rees‚Äîwearing bow tie dyed with original sample of mauveine‚Äîholding RSC journal named after Perkin Mauveine was first named in 1856. Chemist Sir William Henry Perkin, then eighteen, was attempting to create artificial quinine. An unexpected residue caught his eye, which turned out to be the first aniline dye‚Äîspecifically, Perkin's mauve or mauveine is sometimes called aniline purple. Perkin was so successful in recommending his discovery to the dyestuffs industry that his biography by Simon Garfield is titled Mauve. As mauveine faded easily, our contemporary understanding of mauve is as a lighter, less saturated color than it was originally known. \\"Mauveine\\" was named after the mauve colored mallow flower, even though it is a much deeper tone of purple than mauve. The term \\"Mauve\\" in the late 19th century could refer to either the deep, rich color of the dye or the light color of the flower. Mauve (meaning Mauveine) came into great vogue when in 1862 Queen Victoria appeared at the Royal Exhibition in a mauve silk gown‚Äîdyed with mauveine. By 1890, this color had become so pervasive in fashion that author Thomas Beer used it in the title of his book about the 1890s, The Mauve Decade.Thomas Beer: The mauve decade --American life at the end of the nineteenth century , 1926, at gaslight.mtroyal.ab.ca =Artists' pigment purple (red-violet): 1930s= 'Royal purple' (shown above) or the dark violet color known as generic purple is the common layman's idea of purple, but professional artists, following Munsell color system (introduced in 1905 and widely accepted by 1930), regard purple as being synonymous with the red- violet color shown at right, represented by the web color medium violet red, in order to clearly distinguish purple from violet and thus have access to a larger palette of colors. This red-violet color, called artist's purple by artists, is the pigment color that would be on a pigment color color wheel between pigment violet and pigment (process) magenta. In the Munsell color system, this color at its maximum chroma of 12 is called Red-Purple, or more specifically Munsell 5RP. Artists' pigments and colored pencils labeled as purple are typically colored the red-violet color shown at right. On an RYB color wheel, red-violet is the color between red and violet. =Electric purple: 2000s= This color, electric purple, is precisely halfway between violet and magenta and thus fits the artistic definition of purple.Graham, Lanier F.

The equivalent color on a computer to the pigment color red-violet shown above would be this electric purple, i.e. the much brighter purple you can see reproduced on the screen of a computer. This color is pure purple conceived as computer artists conceive it, as the color on the color wheel halfway between color wheel violet and electric magenta. Thus, electric purple is the purest and brightest purple that it is possible to display on a computer screen. Its RGB code is (191, 0, 255). An old name for this color, used by Robert Ridgway in his 1912 book on color nomenclature, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, is true purple.Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Discussion of the color Purple, Page 175; Color Sample of True Purple: Page 125 Plate 51 Color Sample A12‚ÄîTrue Purple is shown on the Purple end of the Purple-Magenta-Rose axis on the bottom and right of the plate.

This color may be called HTML/CSS purple. It seems likely that this color was chosen as the web color purple because its hue is exactly halfway between red and blue and its value is exactly halfway between white and black. A traditional name sometimes used for this tone of purple is patriarch.

The color defined as purple in the Munsell color system (Munsell 5P) is shown at right. The Munsell color system is a color space that specifies colors based on three color dimensions: hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), spaced uniformly in three dimensions in the elongated oval at an angle shaped Munsell color solid according to the logarithmic scale which governs human perception. In order for all the colors to be spaced uniformly, it was found necessary to use a color wheel with five primary colors‚Äîred, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

This tone of purple was very popular among hippies and was the favorite color of Jimi Hendrix. Thus it is called psychedelic purple. Psychedelic purple is the color halfway between electric purple and magenta. In the 1980s, there was a Jimi Hendrix Museum in a Victorian house on the east side of Central Avenue one half block south of Haight Street in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco which was painted this color.

Australia defeated England at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, by 7 runs and won the 1987 Cricket World Cup. =Semi-Finals=  Australia vs Pakistan  Australia won the toss and chose to bat. The Australian batsmen got off to a very good start, and they scored fluently, with David Boon (65 from 91 balls, 4 fours) top scoring, and making an 82 run second-wicket partnership with DM Jones. Australia were looking to reach 300 with strong batting before Imran Khan took 3 wickets for 17 runs in 5 overs. Australia lost 4/31, but a high number of extras (34) from the Pakistani bowlers, as well as the solid batting from earlier on, brought Australia to 267 (8 wickets, 50 overs). Pakistan started badly, falling to 3/38. Imran Khan (58 from 84 balls, 4 fours) and Javed Miandad (70 from 103 balls, 4 fours) shared a partnership of 112 runs in 26 overs. However, with the required run rate at 7.87 runs when Miandad fell, there was just too much for the upcoming batsmen to do, and Pakistan lost 6/99 as they were bowled all out for 249 (all out, 49 overs). Earlier Steve Waugh scored 18 runs off the 50th over bowled by Saleem Jaffar and ironically Pakistan lost the match by 18 runs.  England vs India  India won the toss and chose to field. After reaching 2/79, Graham Gooch (115 from 136 balls, 11 fours) and captain Mike Gatting (56 from 62 balls, 5 fours) shared a partnership of 117 runs in 19 overs. After Gooch was finally stumped, 51 more runs were added, and England reached 254 (6 wickets, 50 overs). India made a bad start, falling to 3/73. The middle order scored fluently, with Mohammed Azharuddin, (64 from 74 balls, 7 fours) top scoring. Before Azharuddin was removed lbw by Eddie Hemmings, India were at 5/204, needing 5 runs an over from the last 10 overs, with 5 wickets in hand, and it looked like it would be a very close game. However, the middle and tailend order for India collapsed, as India lost 5/15. India were eventually bowled all out for 219 (all out, 45.3 overs), giving England both a berth in the final and a measure of revenge for the loss they suffered to India in the semifinal of the World Cup four years earlier in England. =Final= Australia vs England Australia won the toss and chose to bat. David Boon (75 from 125 balls, 7 fours) top-scored for Australia, whose batsmen scored fluently. Australia posted 253 (5 wickets, 50 overs). Mike Veletta (45 from 31 balls, 6 fours) cut loose late in the innings, as Australia scored 65 runs from the last 6 overs of their innings.

The first Black Spring publication was a reprint of Anais Nin's D.H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study, which on its first publication in 1932 had been only the second study of Lawrence's work to appear. This was followed by Patrick Kearney's The Paris Olympia Press: An Annotated Bibliography, which carried a Foreword by Maurice Girodias. Later publications included translations of early Soviet short stories and an epistolary first novel from the French; Nick Cave's debut novel, And the Ass Saw the Angel, which had been commissioned five years previously; reprints of Leonard Cohen's novels together with new editions of his titles Book of Mercy and Death of a Lady's Man; and the memoirs of Carolyn Cassady, Off the Road: Twenty Years with Cassady, Kerouac and Ginsberg. In the early 1990s Black Spring revived the reputation of the black comedy thriller writer Kyril Bonfiglioli by gathering his three previously-published novels featuring art-dealer and bon viveur Charlie Mortdecai and issuing them as The Mortdecai Trilogy; this was followed by a reprint of Bonfiglioli's historical romp All the Tea in China and first publication of The Great Mortdecai Moustache Mystery, left lacking its final chapter at the time of the author's death but now completed by Craig Brown. In 2001 the company was acquired by Robert Hastings, under whose proprietorship it continued to publish original fiction and non-fiction as well as successfully reviving work by Patrick Hamilton, Alexander Baron and Julian Maclaren-Ross.

It is located in the north-east of the Province of Alicante, within the region of the Marina Alta and is one of a number of villages in the area known as Vall de Pop. It has 1,099 inhabitants, of which 62.80% are of foreign nationality (National Institute of Statistics - Spain 2015). Ll√≠ber is bordered by the neighbourhood Penya Roja to the north with Lloma Llarga and Tossal del Cau to the south. Ll√≠ber is accessed from the AP7 motorway, exiting at junction 63, on the CV745 from Benissa, or from the N332 at Gata de Gorgos on the CV748. Ll√≠ber borders the municipalities of Alcalal√≠, Benissa, Gata de Gorgos, Jal√≥n, Pedreguer and Senija. History Located to the north of the municipal area is the Iberian town of Pozo de Gata. The Iberians used to build their settlements in high places in order to obtain a better defence against their enemies. For this same reason, they also walled them. Ll√≠ber and the surrounding lands were conquered in 1256 by King James I of Aragon. The lady Constance of Sicily enjoyed the Ll√≠ber incomes until November 1300, when James II transferred the incomes to those of those of Pego and La Vall d'Uix√≥. From 1413 until 1444 Ll√≠ber was part of the dominion of the Martorell, lineage to which belonged the famous novelist, Joanot Martorell. In 1444 the town of Ll√≠ber was sold at auction at the request of the creditors of Galceran Martorell. The purchasers were Gonzalo de H√≠jar, Comendador de Montalb√°n and his wife, In√©s, de Portugal. On September 12 1444, Gonzalo de Hijar, sold Ll√≠ber to his son Pedro. Later it belonged to the Duke of Almod√≥var. In 1609, Ll√≠ber had 25 houses and was an annex of Xal√≥ which became independent. Until 1707 Ll√≠ber belonged to the government of X√†tiva (J√∫car), which until 1833 was part of the government (township) of D√©nia.

The municipality covers an area of and as of 2011 had a population of 7,771 people. Toponymy See also: Mons Fortis (toponym) . In the thirteenth century, the town was called Nompot (as stated in the charter of the city of Alicante). On December 28 of 1328 the king Alfonso \\"El Benigno\\" gave Nompot village as part of a series of towns and villages in inheritance to his other son, the infant \\"Fernando de la Cerda\\". In an account book of Don Fernando from 1355, it already mentions the town with the name of \\"Monfort\\". After the conflict of \\"The Two Pedros\\" between Pedro I of Castile and Pedro IV of Aragon, Monfort tried to separate from the Crown of Aragon to switch to that of Castile. In punishment, Pedro IV demoted it back to the \\"village\\", returned the toponym \\"Nompot\\" and passed a law that said the population would remain \\"im perpetuom\\" to the, by then, Villa de Alicante. Approximately five years later, it retrieved the name of Monfort. In 1708 the name was \\"Castellaniza\\" then renamed \\"Monforte\\" and in 1916, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, according to Royal Decree of June 27 of 1916, adopted the name as \\"Monforte de la Rambla\\". But that same year, at a meeting at City Hall at the request of the majority of the population (who did not like that name) formally requested the change of name to the current \\"Monforte del Cid\\"; SIENDA approved the request by Royal Decree of 4 December 1916.

Ever since its inception in 2006, it has been serving as a vital link between student community and the administration by being the featured news feed for the students, professors, and alumni, about campus activities, department updates, recruitment information, SAC happenings, fest coverage, alumni news, weekly polls and interviews with the Director, Chief Warden, Professors, distinguished alumni and dignitaries, and exceptional students. The newsletter also does detailed reviews of the Halls of Residence and various other infrastructural entities in the NIT Rourkela campus such as the TIIR building, Biju Patnaik Central Library to name a few.. Primarily as a weekly e-newsletter with a one-page HTML template with an often asked question - \\"Does Monday Morning has more followers than members?\\", as stated by its first editors, Monday Morning has grown to be a full-fledged website with more than 10,000 peak page impressions in a week. Monday Morning launched its app on Google Play Store on 5 February 2017. As of May 2017, the app has received more than 700 downloads with an average rating of 4.9. The e-newsletter also has a YouTube channel, which showcases the various activities of NIT Rourkela. The newsletter has also actively participated in bringing about constructive changes in the institute.  Inception: 2006  Monday Morning dates back to 2006 and was founded by the then final year students ‚Äì Shrinivas Ron and Chinmoy Mohapatra from the suggestion of the then director of NIT Rourkela, Dr Sunil Kumar Sarangi. Monday Morning started primarily as a newsletter site that got uploaded with the news cache for the week on every Sunday night, with the issue going live on Monday Morning. The team that initially consisted of reporters, photographers and technicians started inducting cartoonists in 2012 as well. Kushal Tibrewal is credited for that. The selection of the team is done through an induction procedure during the last week of March and is open to all first-year students. The coming batches kept improving the website further with the addition of newer sections. The summer of 2010 saw a whole new website coming up, one that called associations with \\"Monday morning blues\\". Next summer, Monday Morning went for a sleeker, professional news website, and there was an immediate explosion in sections and news volume.  Project Adamantium: 2015  Website Homepage (26th Issue, 10 April 2017) With a beta website in 2010, which even though got better with the advent of Joomla, Team Monday Morning was constantly trying to bring in new changes, raise more critical issues, changed the course of things and produced impactful content. The Joomla-based MM website was definitely decent and easy to manage, but it was very slow and had dated interface. Furthermore, with the world leaning towards a more mobile-based internet browsing, the website needed to be very responsive. In 2015, Monday Morning decided to collaborate with Microsoft Campus Club, one of the leading technical club of the institute, to develop a new website. The website would be fast, responsive and have a modern and intuitive interface. The project was code-named \\"Project Adamantium\\" by Dilip Raj Baral owing to his fondness of Marvel Cinematic Universe where adamantium is a strong, indestructible metal. As of March 2017, the developers have made over 1 million addition of lines of codes to the code. Dilip Raj Baral, the project lead and lead developer of Project Adamantium says, \\"It was a pretty hectic task. I was supposed to work on this throughout the summer, but I couldn‚Äôt do that because of the Nepal earthquake. So, I only started working during the last two weeks of the vacation, on a tight deadline.\\"  Project Vibranium: 2017  Home Screen of Android App (v0.7-beta) With the success of Project Adamantium and advent of the new and a much responsive website, phase one of using technology advancement in achieving readership was complete and Monday Morning started working on the mobile application which could be used on Android platforms. The project was code-named \\"Project Vibranium\\" following the convention of naming a project after metals or alloys in fictional Marvel Cinematic Universe. The team maintained their workflow using GitHub as they shared their resources and progress using the repository. Using Java for the logic part and XML for the design part, the working of the app was made simple. For this purpose, they built an API (Application Programming Interface) using PHP, which generates a response in JSON format and decided to introduce caching at the client side device to increase the speed of the app. The app was supposed to be multi- layered, unlike the traditional single layer android apps. The team introduced two tabs in the app along with the floating button to access the nested tabs to accommodate the sub-categories of every section.

The proximate causes of the mutiny had existed for years, but had not been addressed to the soldiers' satisfaction. Matters came to a head after rumors spread that their commanding general, Scipio Africanus, had become gravely ill. But the stories proved to be without foundation; he succeeded in suppressing the mutiny and executed its ringleaders.Chrissanthos, p. 183Livy 28.24‚Äì29Polybius 11.25‚Äì30 Ancient scholars considered the mutiny to be the most important event of Africanus's early military career.Chrissanthos, p. 173. Despite a lack of interest on the part of modern historians, the ancients treat the mutiny at Sucro as the most important incident of Scipio's early career.  Location  One source says Sucro is at or near present-day Alzira, a few kilometres east of the mouth of the Sucro/Jucar River.Boix, p. 145 Almost buried in a grove of mulberry trees and towering stands a compact mass of buildings that dominate some towers, and utterly old walls. That is the town of Alzira, that's the old Sucro. Not only in geography, but history also has its place in the city of Sucre. According to another source Sucro is a place half-way between Cartagena and the Ebro River now called Cullera, also near Alzira.Florez, p. 34 paragraph 70 Latin translation: But part of the sea coast in Half in a way even to the Spaniard hence the part Sucro has the distance of the river, and its raids, the city and of the same name. Additional sources also verify that it is Cullera.Murray, p. 498Granell, pp. 67‚Äì92 Yet another source says it is a place midway between Cartagena and Tarraco.Liddell, p. 72 Yet another source says the Sucro camp of 8,000 soldiers was established near the mouth of the Sucro River in a line of communication to New Carthage that Africanus set up, and was just south of Saguntum.Scullard, pp. 100-101  Background  Fasces The mutiny happened when Africanus, who had a fortification of some 8,000 militants camped at Sucro, became seriously ill while occupying New Carthage.Chrissanthos, 178 The military revolt broke out because the rumor about Africanus' health eventually became so exaggerated that it was reported that Africanus was either dead or very near death.Chrissanthos, p. 180livy 28.24 The soldiers at Sucro heard the rumor and planned a mutiny, instigated by some 35 ringleaders who propagated the alleged news. They thought that the great general would not be around much longer. They were frustrated by many aspects of their service and if the revolt turned out successfully, they would then have a chance to voice their concerns.Livy 28.24 One of the many items that caused the mutiny was that the soldiers had not been paid in a timely fashion; some had received no pay for years.Chrissanthos, p. 179 Another was that they did not receive their share of plunder. Yet another was that they were inadequately supplied with the necessities they needed to properly function. The soldiers were also unhappy about their long periods of inactivity, and wanted either to be sent into battle or back to Rome. They also felt that they had not received proper credit for their part in the campaign to expel the Carthaginians from Hispania. A major issue too was that they had been in service far beyond the term normally required of Roman soldiers.Sluiter, p. 356 One of the first things the mutineers did was to show disrespect to their commanding officers. The mutineers then removed the official military tribunes loyal to Rome, and replaced them with their own ringleaders. They proceeded to plunder the towns and areas around the Sucro fort.Polybius 11:25 In addition they removed the normal Roman military insignias and replaced them with the insignia of fasces and axes (a symbol of death).Livy 28.24 Development The mutineers and their ringleaders expected to hear of Africanus's death at any moment, and even anticipated receiving details of his upcoming funeral. Instead, news arrived that Africanus was alive and in good health.Livy 28:25 Two of the Spanish territory tribe leaders, Indibilis and Mandonius, whom during the beginning of the mutiny broke their alliance with Rome and sided with the mutineers, returned to their frontier territories and took no further part in the mutiny. At this point, the instigators of the rumor of Africanus' death, the ringleaders of the mutiny, claimed that they were just gullible people who had passed on the rumor without having verified it; they feared they might be punished if they were identified as those behind the mutiny. Two of the chief instigators were common soldiers by the names of C. Atrius of Umbria and C. Albius of Cales ‚Äì \\"Blackie\\" and \\"Whitie\\" respectively.Liddel, p. 77 Seven loyal military tribunes at Sucro, that were there already, were very much resented in the camp because they would not be disloyal to Rome and side with the mutineers.Chrissanthos, p. 181 They eventually were driven out and went to New Carthage where they were under Africanus's command. With his 7,000 troops at New Carthage outnumbered by the 8,000 mutineers at Sucro, Africanus decided against summary punishment. Instead, he embarked on a course of action designed to avoid an outright clash. Africanus sent the original loyal seven military tribunes back to Sucro, the same tribunes who had been driven out of the Sucro camp earlier, to discover the reasons for the mutiny.Scullard, p. 148 They talked calmly to groups of soldiers gathered at the headquarters tent, at meetings, and to individuals. This diplomatic approach helped to reduce tensions. To foster the calm and peaceful mood the tribunes avoided discussing the issue of the soldiers' treasonable behavior.Chrissanthos, p. 182 The tribunes then reported their findings to Africanus in New Carthage.  Solution  Roman guard capturing a prisoner Africanus then sent back a letter with the original seven loyal tribunes, asking the mutineers to come to New Carthage to collect the back pay that was owed to them, needed supplies, and other items ‚Äì as their demands seemed reasonable.Appian vi.34 Meanwhile he sent collectors to the Spanish cities to gather money and supplies. He made a big show of this, so that the soldiers at Sucro would receive reports that Africanus was earnest in his promise of meeting the soldiers' demand in regard to back pay and provisions. He then choose a day for the rebellious soldiers, and their ringleaders, to receive these items.Polybius 11:26Livy 28.26 Africanus had a secret plan however. Part of it was to set up a ruse in which he pretended to march his army against the chiefs Mandonius and Indibilis and the Lacetanians who had played a role in the mutiny and deserted the Roman alliance. His troops were to march out of the city on the morning before the mutineers were to receive their back pay at New Carthage. The mutineers felt confident then they had the upper hand, since Africanus' army would be gone and only their own Sucro army of some 8,000 troops would be there to confront the pale sick general alone.Liddell, p. 74 Africanus instructed his seven loyal tribunes to find out who the ringleaders were; each of the tribunes was to turn in five names. Other officials were then to meet the instigators and attach themselves to the leaders of the Sucro rebellion. The culprits were greeted with pleasant words and with professional diplomacy when they arrived at New Carthage and were invited to their quarters to be wined and dined into the night.Appian vi.35 Africanus had given the seven loyal tribunes and the Roman guards instructions to arrest the ringleaders once they were in a drunken stupor; they were then placed in leg irons and held in jail.Polybius 11:30 The next morning Africanus assembled all 8,000 mutinous troops in the public forum market-place; to their amazement Africanus appeared to be robust and in perfect health.Appian vi.36 At this point M. Junius Silanus, a lieutenant of Africanus and second in command, surrounded the unarmed 8,000 mutineers with his armed 7,000 troops that in reality had not left the city at all. Africanus gave a speech in which he scolded the mutineers for their high treason against Rome. The loyal armed soldiers then struck their swords against their metal shields, greatly alarming the unarmed mutineers. They then watched in horror while their bound ringleaders were called by name, stripped to the waist, then brought to the center of the forum, punished and beaten, and tied to a stake and finally beheaded in front of them.JSTOR Chicago Journals (Classical Philology), Vol. 15, No. 2, Apr., 1920, Mutiny in the Roman Army by William Stuart Messer Their headless bodies were dragged away on the ground. The mutineers were then given their back pay, but only after removing their insignia of fasces and axes.Livy 28.27 They had to take a new oath of allegiance to Rome and to Africanus and also vow that they would never mutiny again.Livy 28.28 Thus ended the mutiny at Sucro and regaining of the 8,000 troops by Africanus.  Aftermath  When Africanus returned to Rome in 205 BC he celebrated games (ludi) that he had promised during the mutiny.Livy 28:39 He dedicated the games to his success in quelling the mutiny at Sucro, rather than for his victories over the Carthaginians in Spain.

It is the biggest coalfield in the state of Madhya Pradesh. History Coal was discovered in this region, first in Sohagpur Coalfield by a British geologist named Franklin in 1830.Sri Kamal Sharma, Resource Development in Tribal India: an Example of the Baghelkhand Plateau, p. 161, 164, Northern Book Center, After the First World War, the first attempts at coal mining failed, but around 1926 Burhar and Dhanpuri collieries were started. The Anuppur-Chirimiri line was opened in 1939 and mining operations were extended subsequently. Sohagpur Coalfield is a remnant in the Son basin of Gondwana deposition. The coalfield Sohagpur Coalfield is a part of Central India Coalfields. The latter is spread over the districts of Surguja, Koriya (both in Chhattisgarh), Shahdol and Umaria (both in Madhya Pradesh). There are fourteen coalfields in this group, namely Korar, Umaria, Johilla, Sohagpur, Sonhat, Jhilimili, Chirimiri, Sendurgarh, Koreagarh, Damhamunda, Panchbahini, Hasdeo-Arand, Lakhanpur and Bishrampur. The group covers an area of about with estimated reserves of 15,613.98 million tonnes. The deposits are at a depth of 0‚Äì1200 meters. Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except a few blocks in eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential. Sohagpur Coalfield is spread over an area of about and has an estimated reserve of 4,064 million tonnes. There are four coal seams, about 1‚Äì4 m in thickness spread across three sub- basins: Burhar-Amlai sub-basin located in the western part of the coalfield, Kotma sub-basin, located on the Anuppur-Chirimiri branch line, 40 miles east of Burhar and the Jhagrakhand-Bijuri sub-basin in the easternmost part of the coalfield. In general the coal is of low rank, high moisture, high volatiles and non-coking type. Sohagpur Coalfield is divided in two parts by the east- west running Barmni-Chilpa fault. Coal found on the north of this fault is characteristically different from the coal occurring south of the fault. Coking coal has been found in the north of the fault. Sharda Opencast Mine is being expanded from 0.50 million tonnes per annum to 0.85 million tonnes per annum and the mining area from 242.847 ha to 871.205 ha. Highwall mining has been introduced here. Normal open cast methods cannot be used as it is uneconomical to develop the coal seam by such methods in a small, confined area. By using this successful technology for the first time in India, the abandoned Sharda opencast mine has been a landmark in the Indian mining industry. Coalbed Methane Sohagpur Coalfield has ample scope of Coalbed methane exploration.

In a typical 4 byte (on little endian platform) fixed float number lower(lsb) 2 bytes are used to store the decimal part of the number just like integer value. While upper 2 bytes are used to store the part of number before the decimal point. Floating point numbers are, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits and scaled using an exponent. The base for the scaling is normally 2, 10 or 16. The typical number that can be represented exactly is of the form: :Significant digits √ó baseexponent Overview Above method of representing the floating point numbers is complex method of representing the floating point numbers, but with it we can represent wide range of floating points numbers by this method. As well as it is convenient to manipulate the floating point numbers by this method. It is difficult for a human being to convert floating point (real numbers in mathematical language) number into the format in which they are stored into the memory. As well as it is difficult to convert back floating point, looking its hex or binary value, into the real number. Due to the conversion problem fixed floating point numbers are used. Fixed floating point numbers could be easily converted by the human into its memory representation and from memory representation into the actual number. Memory layout Here is detailed memory layout of how fixed floating point number are stored in memory. Suppose we want to represent the number 23.7. In hex representation 23 is represented as 0017. While 7 is represented as 0007, so hex value stored in 4 bytes allocated for fixed float would be 0017 0007. Also if you convert back number which is represented as hex representation in memory 0023 0070. As upper two bytes have value 0023, its decimal representation is 35, while lower two bytes are 0070, which has decimal representation as 112. So the real number in decimal system is 35.112.

He was one of the founders of the Medical Department of the Northwestern University. Biography Andrews was born in Putney, Vermont, a son of Betsy Lathrop and Rev. Elisha D. Andrews, the Congregational minister of that town. There, and in Rochester, New York, he received his preliminary education. He was from the first devoted to botany and geology. At the age of 17 his family moved to central Michigan. While studying at the University of Michigan he excelled in mathematics and natural sciences and was made president of the literary society of his college. He graduated with the degree of B.A. in 1849. He entered the office of Dr. Z. Pitcher, Detroit, in 1850, and attended lectures in the Medical Department of the University of Michigan. At the end of his first year he was made demonstrator of anatomy; received his degree in medicine in the following year, 1851, and was then made lecturer in comparative anatomy. He received his degree of Master of Arts in 1852 from the university, and two years later was made professor of comparative anatomy. He was one of the founders of the Michigan State Medical Society, and in 1853 began the publication of the Peninsular Journal of Medical and Collateral Sciences. In 1855 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy in Rush Medical College, but resigned after one year and devoted himself to practice, especially to surgery. Soon after his arrival in Chicago he aided in founding the Chicago Academy of Science, and was its first president, serving several times in this capacity. A short time after this he, in connection with Dr. Horace Wardner, established a charity dispensary, and a private dissecting room, where he taught a class in anatomy. He was one of the founders of the Chicago Medical College, and was its first professor of surgery. This latter position he held actively or emeritus up to his death. He was also surgeon to the Mercy Hospital. When the Civil War broke out he was made surgeon of the First Illinois Light Artillery, but after a year was obliged to resign by reason of illness incurred in the service. He was the first to make and keep complete medical records of the sick and wounded in war, and his records were accepted by the surgeon general and formed the basis on which records of that office have since been kept. He was a pioneer in practical antisepsis, and was the first man in the west to employ Lister's method after its exploitation. Edmund Andrews Andrews was for many years a member of the American Medical Association, Michigan State Medical Society, Illinois State Medical Society, the Chicago Medical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Chicago Academy of Science, Wisconsin Academy of Science, etc. For a number of years he was a trustee of Northwestern University. He contributed largely to medical literature. Andrews collected and published statistics of 92,815 cases of ether anesthesia and 117,078 cases of chloroform anesthesia, showing the relative risk in the use of these two agents. Andrews was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian Church, and a constant contributor to religious periodicals, his chief topic being the harmony of science and religion. Although he had suffered from enlarged prostate and cystitis for two or three years he attended to his professional work until the day before he went to the hospital for operation. In January 1904, he was operated by his sons for a bladder stone. He recovered after operation well, but then on January 22, he had a sudden attack of vertigo and died in about an hour.The Founders . North western University Medical School Outside of his work in medicine, Dr. Andrews was a geologist of repute, and his work on the early glacial history of North America has been very largely quoted. His papers on geologic subjects have been published in the Proceedings and Transactions of the Chicago Academy of Science and in Silliman's Journal. Once only has he found time to cross the Atlantic, in 1867, when he visited the colleges and hospitals of London and Paris.

In 1917, the authentic \\"Bunkeng\\" tofu was first made by a Chinese immigrant by the name of Ong Kino made the first tofu in Sumedang. Ong Kino came from Anxi County, Quanzhou City, Hokkian Province, China, in the early 20th century. Ong Kino started making tofu for the consumption of his family members, but afterwards he started to sell the tofu to his neighbours. Increasingly, more people came to like the tofu and a business was established due to this. In 1917, Ong Kino's only son, Ong Bunkeng, came to Sumedang and inherited his parent‚Äôs business; Ong Kino and his wife decided to return to their hometown in China. After returning to China, he bequeathed his business to his son, Ong Boen Keng (Chinese:ÁéãÊñáÂçø). From 1970 until 1980 the business advanced. In 1992, the business achieved the highest success and is still very successful to this day. Now the business is taken over by Ong Yu Kim and is almost taken over again by Ong Tjiang.

The rest of the year was spent touring worldwide which included supporting Muse at their Teignmouth homecoming gigs to 12,000 people in September, slots at Glastonbury Festival and CMJ Festival in New York City in October. Touring continued into 2010 with their first headline tour in Europe including dates in Germany, France, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands, then culminating into a final performance at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, US. =Zandra Rhodes= The band also dipped their toes into the world of high fashion. Around this time Zandra Rhodes designed and created stage outfits for the band to be worn at their performance at the CMJ Music Festival in New York City. However, after wearing the outfits the band felt that the image was not right for them and the relationship was ended. =Rooftops, \\"New York\\", surfing accident= Recording for their second album initially began in New York City at the Cutting Room Studios in late 2009 but it was not until the summer of 2010 that they recorded in the Sawmills Studio in Cornwall with producers John Cornfield and Julian Diggle. Rooftops moved away from the raw, two piece feel of Get It Back and saw the band experiment with piano songs as well as larger, grander productions using horns and strings on some tracks. Halfway through the recording session they did a short tour of Germany taking in several festival performances and testing the Rooftops material to audiences for the first time. In August that year, Alex Chisholm suffered a terrible surfing accident in Cornwall, nearly drowning and breaking his neck, after being airlifted to hospital it was said by doctors he would be lucky to walk again and very doubtful that he would ever play drums again. Seemingly their career was over; tours were cancelled and the band went on hiatus. However, his recovery was better than expected, and after only a period of rehabilitation in eight months, he was playing the drums again. During this time Rooftops was officially released to wide critical acclaim especially in Germany. The first single, \\"New York\\", received radio support throughout all of Germany's major radio stations and was the band's first (and biggest) hit. \\"New York\\" later featured on the album Matuschkes Lieblinge Vol. 2 a compilation album released by Sony of the biggest hits in Germany of 2012 which reached number 5 in the German Albums Chart. \\"Don't You Want Me\\" was featured on Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks and \\"Silly Love Song\\" was featured on an advert on the 5* Channel. In a way of helping rehab their friend, James Morrison offered them a support slot on his UK tour and, in 2012 The Sea were playing some of their biggest shows ever in the UK. However the material was deemed a little too soft for their existing UK fans and the band started to hint in interview that Rooftops would be a one off experiment, and they would return to the raw sound they initially became popular for. =Car crash= At the end of 2012, the band then suffered another huge set back when their tour van was in a horrific car crash in Belgium. With the vehicle completely destroyed, both band members walked out alive. However this led to another big tour being cancelled. =High On= In January 2013, the band performed at the Eurosonic Festival in The Netherlands, road testing tracks from their next record, this performance was broadcast on the German music television show, Rockplast. On their return, The Sea began pre-production rehearsals with producer Julian Diggle in a rehearsal studio in Brighton, England. In the spring they went into John Cornfield's home studio in Cornwall, UK and cut another album. At the request of their label in Germany, PopUp, this was condensed into a five track EP that was released on limited edition 12\\" vinyl only. A tour of Europe, UK and festival shows in Canada and US was undertook to support its release. However the band were seemingly unhappy at the limited edition status release and were vocal at the time of wanting a full album and single campaign. A tour of China was cancelled just days before it was due to start. =1808 and \\"Get Up, Stand Up, Die\\"= In January 2014, the band released their first official single in over a year. \\"Get Up, Stand Up, Die\\" was their first UK single for two years and it was one of their most successful UK single. With radio support \\"Get Up, Stand Up, Die\\" was released on download worldwide and on limited edition, hand painted vinyl ‚Äì which sold out. The band embarked on their biggest UK tour ever with over 50 dates as well as many festivals. They also played tour support to the Canadian band Your Favourite Enemies, on their debut UK tour in March. During this tour they released 1808, the original collection of songs recorded at the High On... sessions. It was supported by their next single, \\"I Hear The Drums\\". In July 2014 the band announced they had ceased to be. Their final gig was a sold out show at The Monarch in London on 20 July 2014.

Biography Born in Beirut to an Armenian father and a Greek mother, Berb√©rian spent his youth in Lebanon before finishing his studies in France. He was the brother of cartoonist Charles Berberian. He began his career in the audiovisual field, working as an editor at Canal+. His first feature film was the comedy La Cit√© de la peur, which was hit in France. Based on a script by Les Nuls, the film describes a series of murders in Cannes. Berb√©rian returned in 1998 with Paparazzi, starring Vincent Lindon and Patrick Timsit. The film follows the life of a night watchman (Timsit) who is fired after being photographed at a soccer game, instead of being at his job. He then meets Michel (Lindon), who teaches him how to be a paparazzo. In 2000, Berb√©rian directed Six-Pack, a thriller with Richard Anconina who stalks a serial-killer to the four corners of Paris. Returning in 2002 with the comedy Le Boulet, starring G√©rard Lanvin and Beno√Æt Poelvoorde, a prison guard (Poelvoorde) has to team up with a convict (Lanvin) to retrieve a lotto ticket from the latter. Then in 2004, Berb√©rian paired Christian Clavier and Jean Reno in the comedy, The Corsican File, based on a comic book of the same name by Ren√© P√©tillon, in which a detective is responsible for locating a man living in Corsica who is owed an inheritance. In 2007, he reunited G√©rard Jugnot and Jean-Paul Rouve in L'√éle aux tr√©sors. Death Berb√©rian died in Paris, France, on 22 August 2017, at the age of 64.

Shortly before 7:00am on 15 October 1997 a group of up to six fighters from the LTTE‚Äôs Black Tigers drove a truck laden with approximately explosives into the car park of the Galadari Hotel, a five star luxury hotel, located in the heart of Colombo‚Äôs business and government district, where they shot and killed four unarmed security guards. They then detonated the explosives by firing an RPG at the truck. The terrorists, armed with assault rifles, disbursed and made their way into nearby government buildings and the five-story building that houses Sri Lanka's state-run newspapers where they fought security forces for several hours until they were either killed, blew themselves up, or ingested cyanide pills. The Galadari Hotel car park is located adjacent to the western tower of the Colombo World Trade Centre, two 39-storey office towers that housed the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Information Ministry at the time. Since the Colombo World Trade Centre was inaugurated a few days before, it was suspected to be the main target of the LTTE.British tourists wounded in Tamil Tiger bomb blast Damage to the hotel and nearby buildings, including the Hilton Hotel and the World Trade Centre, was heavy but not structurally catastrophic. The bomb crater was wide and deep. The blast destroyed 30 cars in the Galadari parking lot and shattered all the hotel‚Äôs windows as well as the windows on all the nearby buildings.

The most vital benefit of binocular vision is stereopsis or depth perception, however binocular summation does afford some subtle advantages as well. By combining the information received in each eye, binocular summation can improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, flicker perception, and brightness perception.Foundations of binocular vision: a clinical perspective by Scott B. Steinman, Barbara A. Steinman, Ralph Philip Garzia 2000 pages 153-160 Though binocular summation generally enhances binocular vision, it can worsen binocular vision relative to monocular vision under certain conditions. Binocular summation decreases with age and when large interocular differences are present.\\"Functional Burden of StrabismusDecreased Binocular Summation and Binocular Inhibition\\" by Pineles SL, Velez FG, Isenberg SJ, Fenoglio Z, Birch E, Nusinowitz S, and Demer JL. JAMA Ophthalmol. 2013;131(11):1413-1419 Visual Improvements Some of the ways in which binocular summation improves binocular visual performance are * Brightness perception. The binocularly perceived brightness is larger than the brightness seen by each individual eye. This helps with detection of dim lights and also provoke pupil to decrease its size, which improves focusing. * Flicker perception. Binocular summation can increase the critical flicker fusion rate (CFF) which is the highest perceivable flicker rate before the image appears continuous. The CFF is increased when both eyes see the same flicker, and it is decreased when the flicker for one eye is out of phase with the other. Binocular summation also increases the perceived brightness of the flicker when both inputs are in phase. * Contrast sensitivity. * Visual acuity. A practical measure of binocularity is the binocular summation ratio BSR, which is the ratio of binocular contrast sensitivity to the contrast sensitivity of the better eye.Normal Binocular Vision: Theory, Investigation and Practical Aspects by David Stidwill, Robert Fletcher 2010 pages 29-35 : BSR = CS_{binocular} / CS_{better \\\\ eye} Models for binocular brightness One might expect the inputs from each eye to simply add together, and that the perceived brightness with two eyes is twice that of a single eye. However, the perceived brightness with two eyes is only slightly higher compared to a single eye. If one eye sees a bright scene, the perceived brightness will actually decrease if the other eye is presented with a dim light. This counterintuitive phenomenon is known as Fechner's Paradox. Several different models have been proposed to explain how the inputs from each eye are combined. The renowned physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger, known for his contributions to quantum theory, had a fascination for psychology and he explored topics related to color perception. Schr√∂dinger (1926)\\"Lehre von der strahlenden Energie\\", Mueller-Pouillets Lehrbuch der Physik und Meteorologie, Vol 2, Part 1 (1926) (Thresholds of Color Differences). put forth an equation for binocular brightness and contrast combination where each monocular input is weighted by the ratio of the signal strength from that eye to the sum of the signal from both eyes. The inputs f_l and f_l are monocular brightness flux signals. This equation can be thought of as the sum of the lengths of two vectors.Normal Binocular Vision: Theory, Investigation and Practical Aspects by David Stidwill, Robert Fletcher 2010 pages 29-35 :B = f_l \\\\frac{f_l}{f_l + f_r} + f_r \\\\frac{f_r}{f_l + f_r} = \\\\frac{f_l^2 + f_r^2}{f_l + f_r} MacLeod (1972)MacLeod, D. I. A. (1972). The Schr√∂dinger equation in binocular brightness combination. Perception, 1, 321‚Äì324. expanded upon Schr√∂dinger's work by proposing the following formula for the signal strength of a neural signal f in terms of internal noise f_0, luminance difference across the contour l, and threshold luminance difference l_0. : f = \\\\begin{cases} f_0 + \\\\log{(\\\\frac{l}{l_0})}, & \\\\text{if }l \\\\ge l_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ f_0 & \\\\text{if }l < l_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} Process It is still uncertain exactly how this process is performed by the brain and remains an active area of research. The mechanism can be explained by some combination of probability summation, neural summation, and effects due to binocular-monocular differences in pupil size, accommodation, fixation, and rivalry. Probability summation comes from the principle that there is a greater chance of detecting a visual stimulus with two eyes than with one eye. There are five possible results when the input stimuli are summed together. These are * Binocular facilitation. The summation is more than twice that of a single input. * Complete binocular summation. The summation is exactly twice that of a single input. * Partial binocular summation. The summation is greater than that of a single input, but less than twice as large. * No binocular summation. The summation is the same as a single input. * Binocular inhibition. The summation is lower than worse than a single input. Binocular Fusion Both motor fusion and sensory fusion mechanisms are used to combine the two images into a single perceived image. Motor fusion describes the vergence eye movements that rotate the eyes about the vertical axis. Sensory fusion is the psychological process of the visual system that creates a single image perceived by the brain.

He introduced into British restaurant culture menus that were radically different from the norm in the 1950s, in terms of both the nature of the food and the range of dishes available. Early life George Perry Smith (he adopted the style Perry-Smith in adulthood) was born in Widnes, Lancashire, the son of a Methodist minister, whose changes of local appointments necessitated an unsettled life. Additionally, by the time he was 12 both his parents had died. He was brought up by an aunt who sent him to Kingswood School in Bath. He went up to St John's College, Cambridge, to read Modern Languages, but his studies were interrupted by World War II. As a conscientious objector, he joined the Friends Ambulance Unit. He was introduced to cooking by Eric Green, a fellow member of the FAU, during a week working in the nurses' kitchen of Middlesex Hospital.The Telegraph - Obituaries. 4 October 2003. George Perry-Smith. He returned to college after the war, and then spent two years in Paris teaching at the Sorbonne, where his interest in French cuisine blossomed. =The Hole in the Wall Restaurant= Returning from France, Perry-Smith headed for Bath, and was employed teaching French at Kingswood School, but he did not enjoy it. When a cafe in Bath known as The Cellar, the entrance to which was through an old coal store, came on the market, Perry-Smith and his partner, Kit Hammond-Spencer, bought it and opened a restaurant. US military clientele had nicknamed it The Hole in the Wall, and the name stuck. He had no formal culinary training, but did have a natural talent for cooking. Taking inspiration from domestic cookery books, he developed many of his own recipes, but was also keen to follow the suggestions of the influential food writer Elizabeth David. Perry-Smith developed a drive for uncompromising excellence and was always anxious to buy fresh ingredients from local suppliers. He became widely acknowledged as the father of the best of post-war English cooking. Later life Perry-Smith sold the Hole in the Wall in 1972, tired of the attention it attracted. After the sale of The Hole he spent a short period in Bristol running the restaurant at The Bristol Guild . Perry-Smith then spent some time travelling around Europe before settling in Helford, Cornwall, where he opened Riverside, a restaurant with rooms. Joyce Molyneux from the Hole in the Wall opened The Carved Angel at Dartmouth at about the same time. They continued to collaborate and share ideas. In retirement Perry-Smith remained in Helford, although he continued to travel extensively. Despite his influence on other cooks, he wrote not a single cookery book.

concrete gravity dam on the Luan River in Qianxi County, Hebei Province, China. The primary purpose of the dam is to provide water for the cities of Tianjin and Tangshan, located to the south. The dam also provides flood control and its power plant has an installed capacity of 420 MW which includes a 270 MW pumped storage power station. Background Construction on the first stage of the project began in 1975 and the single 150 MW generator was operational in 1981. In 1984, the first stage was complete and in the same year, construction on the second stage began. This consisted of the lower reservoir and pump-generators for the pumped storage power station. In 1989, the lower reservoir began to impound and in 1993, the pump-generators were operational. Water supplied by the dam is used for industrial, agricultural and municipal needs in Tianjin and Tangshan. When the Panjiakou Reservoir was filled, it submerged the town of Panjiakou under of water. Located in the hills above the town is a section of the Great Wall, part of which was submerged as well. The submerged section ran through Panjiakou pass and a portion can be seen on a small island off the reservoir's edge at , particularly during droughts when the reservoir holds less water. The scenery around the reservoir is a popular tourist destination and with the surrounding terrain, it is often called \\"Qianxi Little Three Gorges\\". Design and operation The Panjiakou Dam is a tall and concrete gravity dam. The dam's reservoir has a capacity of and surface area of . Of the reservoir's capacity, is active (or \\"useful\\") for power generation and water supply. The dam sits at the head of a catchment area which constitutes 75 percent of the Luan River basin. The dam's spillway is located on its left face and contains 18 floodgates. It has a maximum discharge capacity of . To the right of the spillway is the power house which contains one 150 MW Francis turbine generator and three 90 MW reversible Francis turbine pump generators. Located downstream is the lower reservoir dam. It is a gravity type and has a height of and length of . It creates the lower reservoir with a storage capacity of of which can be used for pumped storage power generation. When the pumped storage capability is used, the Panjiakou Reservoir serves as the upper reservoir and water is released down to the three pump generators for power production. It is subsequently discharged into the lower reservoir. This occurs during periods of high peak power demand. When power demand is low, usually at night when electricity is cheaper, the turbines of the pump generators reverse and pump water back into the upper reservoir. This process repeats as needed. A small power plant on the lower reservoir dam contains two 5 MW Kaplan turbine bulb-generators.

It was designed by architect Ernest C. S. Holmboe and built in 1937‚Äì1938, as a project of the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA). The two-story masonry building is in the Georgian Revival style. It was built on the foundation of a previous school destroyed by fire. The front facade features a two-story pedimented projecting pavilion emphasized by large Doric order pilasters. It is constructed of hollow tile block with a red brick veneer. The truncated hipped roof is topped by a wooden cupola. Construction of the school was authorized by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in May 1937, making it one of the last buildings, if not the last building, constructed through the WPA. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Today the school functions as a community center. It houses a commercial kitchen, workout center, and a few small businesses. It is also used for community events such as square dances and Chamber of Commerce dinners.

It was discovered on 12 December 1996, by astronomers of the Spacewatch program at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near of Tucson, Arizona, United States.  Description  is classified as an Amor asteroid because its perihelion is less than 1.3 AU and does not cross Earth's orbit. The asteroid is on a low- eccentricity and low-inclination orbit between the orbits of Earth and Mars. This is within a region of stability where bodies may survive for the age of the Solar System, and hence it may have formed near its current orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1‚Äì1.3 AU once every 1 years and 4 months (474 days; semi-major axis of 1.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Kitt Peak in December 1996. Between 1900 and 2200 its closest approach with Earth is more than 0.11 AU.

History  The first station building was opened by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company on 9 October 1847 along with its Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund line. Since its inauguration, the station has been rebuilt several times, starting in 1865. In 1902, the platforms received a canopy and, on 8 November 1902, an underpass was completed to the second platform. In 1926, Schwelm became a railway junction, when the Witten‚ÄìWengern Ost/Schwelm railway was opened by Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1988, the station became part of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, on line S 8 from Hagen via Wuppertal to M√∂nchengladbach. This uses a flying junction built by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in the 1980s that takes the S-Bahn tracks from Wuppertal to Schwelm under the parallel mainline tracks running towards Hagen directly east of Schwelm station, connecting via a short section of the Witten‚ÄìWengern Ost/Schwelm line (the rest of which is closed) to the partially closed D√ºsseldorf-Derendorf‚ÄìDortmund S√ºd railway towards Gevelsberg-West.

It is located on the Molenbeek, in the Denderstreek, within the southeast of East Flanders and belongs to the Arrondissement of Aalst. It is bordered by the sub-municipalities of Bambrugge proper, Vlekkem (municipality of Erpe-Mere), Ottergem (municipality of Erpe-Mere) and Zonnegem (municipality of Sint-Lievens-Houtem). Egem also borders the domain Steenberg. Egem consists of two streets, the Egemstraat and Everdal.  History  Through the centuries Egem has had multiple names. In the oldest documents it was found to be named Heddeghem (1571), later it was also mentioned as Edeghem (1629), Hettegem (1638), Eedegem (1763), Eghem (1779) and Eegem (1842). Etymologically, Flemish toponyms ending with ‚Äìgem refer to a Germanic compound of ‚Äìhaim, meaning ‚Äòhome‚Äô or ‚Äòresidence‚Äô, and a derivative ending ‚Äìinga. The first part of the name \\"Egem\\" is commonly assigned to the Germanic name of Haid, Hait or Heit. In its totality, the compound Haidingahaim meant ‚Äòresidence of the followers or tribal members of Frank Haid‚Äô, degenerated into Heddeghem. The locality name belongs to the group of ingahemnames who are older than regular hemnames. Egem was founded in the early centuries of the Merovingian era (6th-7th century), and thus has an older origin than Bambrugge. Egem was probably a secluded homestead which was not too great, and was later absorbed by the rapidly faster developing Bambrugge.

It was built in 1375-1378 as an endowment of prince Lazar of Serbia. Lazarica, as an outstanding achievement of the Serbian medieval architecture, was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia. Lazarica was built as a prototype of the Morava school of architecture, as a palace church associated with the Kru≈°evac Fortress, the capital of Prince Lazar. Today, only Lazarica and parts of the keep remain from the vast fortress complex.  History  Information about the founding of the church can be found in the \\"≈Ωitije despota Stefana Lazareviƒáa\\" by Constantine of Kostenets. Lazar of Serbia built the church at the same time as the fortifications for the capital Kru≈°evac. In 1455, Kru≈°evac fell under Ottoman Empire rule, and the church was abandoned and desecrated. Lazarica was used as a stable for horses, and the roof was torn down for use elsewhere. During the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War, from 1736 to 1739, Lazarica was partially reconstructed, and the interior was painted with frescos by Andra Andrejeviƒá. After that, Kru≈°evac fell under Ottoman rule again.

Biography  Belonging to a dynasty of painters, Gennari was a student of Guercino, the grandson of Benedetto Gennari, and older brother of Cesare Gennari. His father was Ercole Gennari and mother Lucia Barbieri. He trained at the workshop of the celebrated master, Guercino, hence his style was always very close to that of his teacher. Upon Guercino's death, Gennari inherited his studio which he ran with his brother Cesare. With a restless spirit, Gennari traveled to Paris in March 1672 to work for the court of King Louis XIV. The French nobility received him with open arms, and the multitude of commissions encouraged him to prolong his stay. In September 1674, he moved to London where he became court painter to King Charles II of England and his successor James II. He painted allegorical and mythological scenes, and above all portraits. Catherine of Braganza and Mary of Modena, Catholic wives of Protestant kings, commissioned artworks for their private worship. Gennari had to leave England when King James was dethroned; he followed James's court to Saint-Germain-en- Laye in 1689. By 1692, he was back in Bologna. Gennari was an outstanding portraitist who eventually developed a style far removed from the principles taught in the school of Guercino. In the mature phase of his style, he came to acquire characteristics of the art of northern Europe, which he learned through his travels. In 1709, he was one of the founding members of the Accademia Clementina.

The position existed in Scandinavia during the Viking era and into the Middle Ages. Ringkvinna is primarily mentioned in the Icelandic Gr√°g√°s and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws, in which it is phrased in much the same way. Unmarried women in general, referred to as maer and mey, were secure in their rights of independence: at the age of 20, a woman reached the right of legal majority and had the right to decide about her own place of residence and stand by herself in all juridical senses before the law. These same rights applied to widows.Borgstr√∂m Eva : Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women: genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. (inb.). Libris 8707902. The one exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, which was a matter for the whole family. In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could inherit the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother. Women with such status were referred to as ringkvinna. She exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan until she married at which time her rights were transferred to her husband. The right to inherit in itself applied to both the paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter of the deceased, who were all named as odalkvinna, but the right to inherit the position of head of the family was a right which could only be inherited by the daughter or the sister of a dead man. The ringkvinna had the specific support of the law to perform all the tasks normally performed by a head of the family, such as, the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member. If she married, however, these rights were passed on to her spouse. These rights were preserved also after Christianization although they seem to have disappeared in the late 13th century, at which time they are no longer mentioned in any law texts.

Collecting the hits in that order is known as a \\"natural cycle\\", which has occurred 14 times in Major League Baseball (MLB). The cycle itself is semi-rare in MLB, occurring a total of 330 times, starting with Curry Foley in 1882. In terms of frequency, the cycle is roughly as common as a no-hitter; Baseball Digest calls it \\"one of the rarest feats in baseball\\". Only one current team in MLB has never had a player hit for the cycle: the Miami Marlins. The most cycles hit by a single player in MLB is three, accomplished by four players; John Reilly was the first to hit a third when he completed the cycle on August 6, 1890, after hitting his first two in a week (September 12 and 19, 1883) for the Cincinnati Reds. Bob Meusel became the second man to complete three cycles, playing for the New York Yankees; his first occurred on May 7, 1921, the next on July 3, 1922, and his final cycle on July 26, 1928. Babe Herman accomplished the feat for two different teams--the Brooklyn Robins (May 18 and July 24, 1931) and the Chicago Cubs (September 30, 1933). Adri√°n Beltr√© is the most recent addition to this list, cycling first for the Seattle Mariners (September 1, 2008) before cycling twice as a member of the Texas Rangers (August 24, 2012 and August 3, 2015). Beltr√© is the only player to have completed all three cycles in the same ballpark, with the first occurring as an opponent of the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Park in Arlington. The most cycles hit in a single major league season is eight, which has occurred twice: first in the 1933 season, and then again in the 2009 season; all eight cycles in each of those seasons were hit by different players. Cycles have occurred on the same day twice in MLB history: on September 17, 1920, hit by Bobby Veach of the Detroit Tigers and George Burns of the New York Giants; and again on September 1, 2008, when the Arizona Diamondbacks' Stephen Drew and the Seattle Mariners' Adri√°n Beltr√© each completed the four-hit group. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was five years, one month, and ten days, a drought lasting from Bill Joyce cycle in 1896 to Harry Davis in 1901. Three players‚ÄîJohn Olerud, Bob Watson and Michael Cuddyer‚Äîhave hit for the cycle in both the National and American Leagues. Three family pairs have hit for the cycle: father and son Gary and Daryle Ward, who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004, respectively; grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell, in 1951 and 2004; and father and son Craig and Cavan Biggio, in 2002 and 2019. Dave Winfield and Mel Ott are the oldest and youngest players to hit for the cycle, at ages 39 and 20, respectively. Of multiple-cycle hitters, John Reilly holds the record for the shortest time between cycles (seven days), while Aaron Hill holds the record since the formation of the American League, with his two 2012 feats coming within an 11-day span. Conversely, George Brett's two cycles came 11 years and 58 days apart. Christian Yelich is the only player to hit for the cycle twice in one season against the same team, doing so 20 days apart against the Cincinnati Reds in 2018. On October 8, 2018, Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox hit for the cycle against the New York Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series; it was the first cycle in MLB postseason history.

Ted Williams hit for the cycle on July 21, 1946, after spending the three previous seasons serving in the military during World War II. Joe DiMaggio hit his second cycle in 1948, eleven seasons after his first cycle. The first cycle of the 1950s was hit by George Kell as a member of the Detroit Tigers. Mickey Mantle hit for the cycle in 1957. Ken Boyer hit for the cycle in 1961 and 1964, as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. Carl Yastrzemski hit for the cycle against the Detroit Tigers in 1965. The last natural cycle of the 1960s was hit by Billy Williams in 1966. Rod Carew was one of five players to hit for the cycle in 1970. The first cycle of the 1980s was hit by Iv√°n DeJes√∫s. alt=A smiling man wearing a navy-blue baseball jersey with \\"Twins\\" across the chest in red script alt=A man wearing a gray baseball uniform and navy-blue baseball helmet swinging a baseball bat The last cycle by a Montreal Expos player was hit by Vladimir Guerrero in 2003. Bengie Molina was one of three players to hit for the cycle in July 2010. The only cycle of 2014 was hit by Michael Cuddyer; it was the second cycle of his career. Rangers outfielder Shin-Soo Choo hit for the cycle on July 21, 2015; his teammate Adri√°n Beltr√© hit for his third career cycle 13 days later. Brock Holt of the Boston Red Sox was the first player to hit for the cycle in the postseason. Cavan Biggio of the Toronto Blue Jays is the most recent player to hit for the cycle. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" + Key to symbols in player table !scope=\\"row\\" Player recorded cycle in a postseason game -

The story is divided into seventeen chapters and is written using the third person narrative mode; interspersed between them are a number of interludes all entitled \\"The Observations of the Green Mare\\" which are written as first person narratives. These two different narrative modes used throughout the book allow the reader to observe the characters and situations from slightly different perspectives. The novel is essentially an examination of the sexual mores and behaviors of the members of a small 19th century French village some time shortly following the Franco- Prussian War. The plot concerns a feud that has taken place for generations between the Haudouin and Maloret families, and a missing letter that contains revealing secrets relating to the conflict. The green mare of the title is in fact a magical painting of an unusually-colored horse owned by one of the Haudouins that has somehow been imbued with an observing consciousness by the artist who painted it. The Green Mare has been translated into English by Norman Denny (fr). The book was filmed by Claude Autant-Lara in 1959 as The Green Mare.

The Cycle is focused on the relationship and the interpolation between natural sounds and human voice, the main musical interest of the composer on which he has been researching for a long time, starting from Red Bird composition released through analog means. The poetics at the base of the work has linguistic and philosophical marks, regarding the relationship between creation and disintegration of man, between natural developments and failure of western culture and society. The Raw and the Cooked by Claude L√©vi-Strauss suggested to the composer this central idea for his album. All the movements included in the original record are performed by the Electric Phoenix ensemble, using the extended vocal techniques following the scores according to the composer's indications. The recordings of the voices in the electroacoustic compositions are related with animals, natural and mechanical sounds; the spectromorphological transformations of the voices and sounds are conducted by technological means, with four-channel spazialization for the performances. Vox V only is based on the recording of vocal sounds improvised by Wishart himself and the transformation of these. Commissioned by IRCAM in 1981 and released in 1986, this composition resumes the characteristics of the entire cycle in its several production steps. From the poetical point of view, this movement represents the narrative climax; from the technical point of view it is the only piece conceived to be totally acousmatic while the other pieces have been composed to be performed. Vox V can be considered as the result of the research on the transformations of sound that Wishart has been conducting for a long time, which led to the creation of Sound Loom - Composers' Desktop Project (CDP) software. The piece was first broadcast on the French Radio INA/GRM, within Acousmatique cycle. The methodology at the base of the entire work is focused on the musical space as sonorous continuum and the concept of transformation, from a spectromorphological point of view. The essential compositional device is the gesture in the sound continuum, the transformation from one sound propriety to another as from one symbol to another. Wishart is focused on the dynamics and timbre evolution within the single musical events. In particular, regarding the interpolation between voice and other sounds, Vox V has perhaps the \\"classic sonic example of this process in the transformation from the voice to a swarm of bees and the return of the voice.\\" Finally, the work is openly dedicated to the human voice. The composer's interest is about the voice versatility as superior to any other musical instrument for sound production, although, as the composer declared, he has been using the voice since the beginning because it was easier than recording natural or urban sounds through old analog means, when new technologies were not available.

Ze'evi was the first Israeli minister to be assassinated since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and the most senior Israeli person to be killed by Palestinian militants during the entire Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Ze'evi's assassins fled the scene and hid for a time in the Mukataa compound in Ramallah under the auspices of Yasser Arafat. An agreement was eventually reached during Operation Defensive Shield, in which Israeli forces besieged the Mukataa compound. Ze'evi's assassins were transferred to the Jericho prison under the supervision of British and American guards. The Islamist militant organization Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh publicly announced his intention to free Ze'evi's assassin squad members. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the Jericho jail, charging that the Palestinian Authority was not sticking to the agreement reached with Israel four years earlier. As a result, Israel launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods on the same day in which the Israel Defense Forces captured Ze'evi's assassins; they were tried in Israel, convicted, and given long prison terms. Preparations phase In September 2001 the PFLP reached a decision to assassinate the Israeli tourism minister Rehavam Ze'evi purportedly in retaliation for the targeted killing of the PFLP leader Abu Ali Mustafa by Israel in August 2001. As a result, the PFLP began gathering detailed intelligence information on Ze'evi's whereabouts and schedule, and found out that he had a permanent room in the Hyatt hotel in Jerusalem, located on the border between the neighborhoods of French Hill and Mount Scopus.◊†◊¢◊†◊¢10 ‚Äì ◊§◊®◊°◊ï◊ù ◊®◊ê◊©◊ï◊ü: ◊©◊ó◊ñ◊ï◊® ◊®◊¶◊ó ◊î◊©◊® ◊®◊ó◊ë◊¢◊ù ◊ñ◊ê◊ë◊ô ‚Äì ◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ The assassin squad members booked a room at the hotel by telephone and provided a fake ID. The assassins arrived at the hotel the night before the assassination in order to prepare for the attack.  Assassination  On 17 October 2001, the day of the assassination, Rehavam Ze'evi was staying at the Dan Jerusalem Hotel, formerly called at the time, the Hyatt Hotel, in room number 816. Ze'evi did not have any bodyguards, as he principally refused to change his habits due to terrorist threats.Minister of Tourism Rehavam Zeevi assassinated at point- blank range in Jerusalem Hyatt ‚Äì Globes At 6:00 am, one of the assassins, Hamdi Quran, went to the dining room of the hotel to make sure that Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in accordance with his routine schedule. At 06:20 am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down to the dining room of the hotel.◊û◊°◊û◊õ◊ô◊ù When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which was parked in the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator. The two assailants met in their room, prepared their weapons, and headed towards Ze'evi's room at the 8th floor. The assailants waited for Ze'evi near the fire escape, in a location adjacent to Ze'evi's room. Meanwhile, at 6:45 am Ze'evi's driver, Adi Maman, got to the dining room of the hotel and joined Ze'evi and his wife for breakfast. At 06:50 am Ze'evi headed by himself towards his room using the elevator. Two minutes later, Yael Ze'evi and the driver, Adi Maman, also began heading towards Ze'evi's room. When the elevator door opened Ze'evi stepped out of the elevator and passed the two assailants. According to the assailants testimony, Quran shouted at him \\"Hey!\\" and when Ze'evi turned to Quran, he shot Ze'evi in the head three shots from a close distance. Two bullets hit Ze'evi's head. Although the second bullet hit Ze'evi's jaw and did not cause a fatal injury, the first bullet penetrated his brain and caused irreversible damage. Immediately after assassinating Ze'evi the assassins escaped the scene of the crime. From the hotel the assassins fled to the Palestinian Authority controlled area in the West Bank. At 7:00 am, only a few minutes after the assassination, Yael Ze'evi and Ze'evi's driver discovered Ze'evi lying on the floor of the corridor, shot in the head and bleeding. Ze'evi was rushed to the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem in critical condition and the doctors attempted to save him. His death was eventually announced at 10:00 am. Ze'evi was the first Israeli minister to be assassinated since the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, and the most senior Israeli person to be killed by Palestinian militants during the entire Arab- Israeli conflict.  Claim of responsibility  The PFLP claimed responsibility for the assassination and stated that it was carried out as a revenge for the killing of the PFLP leader Abu Ali Mustafa in August 2001.USA TODAY Archives Search Rabah Muhana, a senior PFLP official, said \\"The Israelis killed one prominent leader and Mr Ze'evi is one of those who have very, very right-wing points of view on discrimination‚Äîhe wants to deport Palestinians and he is with the most severe terrorism against the Palestinians\\".  Ze'evi's funeral  The assassination of Ze'evi was a shock to the Israeli public and left a lasting impression on many Israelis. Thousands of people attended the funeral of Ze'evi that took place a day after the assassination, at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where Ze'evi was buried. President Moshe Katsav and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon eulogized Ze'evi at his funeral. Official reactions ;Involved parties : * Prime minister Ariel Sharon stated that after Ze'evi's assassination \\"everything had changed\\", and he held the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, personally responsible for the assassination. : * Palestinian Authority condemned the assassination, but laced the statement with a call for Israel to immediately cease its policy of targeted killings of Palestinian militant leaders who Israel believes are responsible for launching attacks. * President of the Palestinian Authority Yasser Arafat condemned the act and said he would do all he could to arrest the assassins.USA TODAY Archives Search ;International * : UK prime minister Tony Blair condemned the assassination stating \\"We condemn utterly this contemptible act of violence\\". * : US President George W. Bush condemned the assassination in the strongest terms and called it a despicable act.  Subsequent related events  = Israeli siege of the Mukataa and the following \\"Ramallah Agreement\\" = Immediately after the assassination, the Israeli security establishment launched an intensive investigation to track down the assassins and the PFLP leader who initiated and planned the attack. Israel demanded from the Palestinian Authority to arrest those responsible for the assassination.Thirty-three PFLP members arrested, CNN, 19 October 2001 In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, Israeli security forces learned that the assassins were hiding in the Mukataa, Yasser Arafat's presidential compound in Ramallah, which Israeli troops had besieged since 29 March. Israel demanded that the Palestinian Authority hand over the assassins in return for withdrawing its troops. The Palestinian Authority refused to extradite the assassins. In the end, through international mediation, Israel agreed to a proposal (which came to be known as the \\"Ramallah Agreement\\") whereby Ze'evi's assassins would be imprisoned in a Jericho jail guarded by British and American forces, and in return Israel would remove the siege of Yasser Arafat's compound. As a result, in February 2002, Arafat ordered to arrest Ze'evi's assassin squad members and imprison them in the Jericho prison. In May 2002 the British and American forces arrived at the Jericho prison. Nevertheless, after the Islamist militant organization Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, the Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh publicly announced his intention to free Ze'evi's assassin squad members. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the Jericho jail, charging that the Palestinian Authority was not sticking to the agreement reached with Israel four years earlier. As a result, Israel launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods on the same day. = Operation Bringing Home the Goods = On 14 March 2006, IDF forces raided the Jericho prison where Ze'evi's assassin squad members were imprisoned with the aim of preventing them from being released by the Hamas government, and bringing the assassins to justice in Israel.Israelis storm Jericho jail and seize 6 ‚Äì The New York Times After a siege which lasted about 10 and a half hours, and after the Israeli military forces began using bulldozers to tear down the Jericho prison walls, the four assassins finally surrendered: * Ahed Abu Gholma ‚Äì the mastermind behind the assassination of Rehavam Ze'evi.U.S. and British Monitors Flee Palestinian Area Due to Security Concerns * Majdi Rahima Rimawi ‚Äì the head of the assassination squad who was the getaway driver during the operation. * Hamdi Quran ‚Äì the actual person who shot Rehavam Ze'evi. * Bassel al-Asmar ‚Äì the look-out for the operation. During the raid, in addition to the four assassins, Israel also captured Ahmed Saadat (who Israel alleges ordered Ze'evi's assassination) and Fuad Shubaki (suspected by Israel as being the mastermind behind a shipment from Iran of smuggled weapons seized by Israel in January 2002). = Assassins' trial in Israel = Ze'evi's assassins were tried in Israel. The four were convicted and received long prison terms ‚Äì Quran received a sentence of 125 years in prison, Asmar received a sentence of 45 years in prison and Majdi Rahima Rimawi received a life sentence with an additional 80 years in prison and Ahad Olma was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in initiating and planning the assassination. In addition, on 25 December 2008, an Israeli military court sentenced Ahmed Saadat, being the leader of the PFLP, to 30 years in prison for heading an \\"illegal terrorist organization\\" and for his responsibility for all actions carried out by his organization, especially for the assassination of Rehavam Ze'evi.

Rather than a static figure in which the sitter's essence in captured by abstracting his character, Bernini has captured a specific gesture to create a likeness that is psychological as well external. The sense of movement is further emphasised by the dramatic creases and folds line his robe, suggesting the movement of his body, and, in the second version, one of the buttons is about to come undone. Patronage and Creation Both of Bernini's early biographers, Domenico Bernini and Filippo Baldinucci, recount the history of the busts and explain the creation of the second version.Domenico Bernini, Vita del Cavalier Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini, 1713, pp 10-11Filippo Baldinucci, Vita del Cavaliere Gio. Lorenzo Bernino, translated by Catherine Enggass, 1966, p. 12 After Bernini had completed the first version, the ‚Äòallustratori‚Äô were polishing the bust when they discovered a significant fracture in the marble across the forehead, disfiguring the face. Bernini was notified and immediately set to work to create a second version with a new block of marble, which took three days according to Domenico Bernini, and fifteen to Baldinucci. The biographers then recount slightly different stories about how the two versions were unveiled. According to Domenico Bernini, Cardinal Borghese saw the unpolished version and was so impressed he asked that the bust be completed and be shown to his uncle, Pope Paul V. It was then the defect was discovered and Bernini created the second version, which was transported in secret to show to the Pope. But the Cardinal noticed that this was a different version and Bernini revealed the creation of the second bust. Baldinucci's tale differs somewhat - unaware there is a second version, Cardinal Borghese sees the original bust. He expresses pleasure in the work but hides his disappointment in the flaw; Bernini then uncovers the second, unblemished version to which the Cardinal responds with astonishment and pleasure at Bernini's artistry. Date of the Busts While the continuing existence of the scar across first version explains why the second version was created, both stories should be treated with some suspicion. Much documentation, cited below, proves the busts were finished in 1632 - Pope Paul V, mentioned in both accounts, died in 1621. A document in the State Archive of Modena, dated 8 January 1633) says that \\"Bernini, commissioned by the Pope, has created a marble bust of Cardinal Borghese, for which he has been recompensed 500 zecchini and a diamond worth 150 scudi\\".Italo Faldi, Galleria Borghese : le sculture dal secolo XVI al XIX, 1954, p.38 A letter from the writer Fulvio Testi to the Cardinal to Count Francesco Fontana, 29 January 1633 also talks of the bust, Testi saying it cost 1000 scudi, and that the figure is ‚Äòtruly alive and breathing‚Äô. Another document written by Lelio Guidiccioni on 4 June 1633 gives further credence that the portrait was done in 1632.Cesare, D'Onofrio, Roma vista da Roma, p.386 Finally, a receipt in the Borghese archives for 23 December 1632 reveals a payment from the Borghese household to Bernini of 500 scudiHoward Hibbard, Un nuovo documento ... , Bolletino dell'Arte, 1961, pps.101-5 History and Critical Reaction On completion, both busts were taken to the Villa Borghese. They were purchased by the Italian State in 1892, and shown at the Galleria dell‚ÄôAcademia in Venice, until they were reunited with the rest of the collections at the Galleria Borghese in 1908. Restoration on the works took place in 1997. The first version is often considered the superior version with Howard Hibbard describing Bernini's handling of the marble as giving it a ‚Äònew dimension of reality‚Äô. Whilst the second is still clearly the work of Bernini, it is considered much less spontaneous.,Maurizio and Marcello Fagiolo dell‚Äô Arco, Bernini: una introduzione al gran teatro del barocco, entry no. 69 with Wittkower commenting that it lacks the animation and vitality of the first one.Rudolf Wittkower, Bernini, 1955, p.200 Others, however, are quite happy to point out the strengths of the second bust, Charles Avery calling it \\"one of the greatest portraits of all time in any medium, this bust is a work of genius\\"Charles Avery, Bernini, Genius of the Baroque, 1997, p.88  Preparatory Versions  A bronze version, created from the terracotta bozzetti (preparatory works) done by Bernini, exists in a private collection in New York.A \\"Bronzetto\\" of Scipione Borghese by Bernini.

He was an intelligent and popular man who would undoubtedly have played an influential role in Irish politics had it not been for his premature death. Though some sources refer to him as the nephew of the 11th Baron Howth, the weight of evidence is that he was the only surviving son of Nicholas St Lawrence, 11th Baron Howth and Jane Montgomery, only daughter of George Montgomery, Bishop of Derry and his first wife Susan Steyning.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland Volume 3 J Moore 1789 He was born, probably in Colchester, Essex, in 1628. The St Lawrence family had inherited estates near Colchester from William's grandmother Elizabeth Wentworth, which presumably explains why he was sent to Colchester Grammar School, which he entered in 1639. His father died at the height of the English Civil War; as he was a staunch Royalist, his property had suffered considerably from attacks by the Parliamentary forces. William himself is said to have been left in peace after his father's death, despite serving briefly with the Royalist forces. In 1660 he used his political influence to support the Restoration of Charles II, and was recommended to the King by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde as a military commander.Ball F.

He was on good terms with Ormond's successor as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor, and entertained him at Howth Castle in 1669. He fell ill in 1671 and died in June of that year. His last will, dated May 14 1671, contains evidence of his wide circle of gifted friends including Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory (whom he appointed his children's guardian), John Keating, the future Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and the leading physician Nicholas Henshaw.

Known for her \\"ear-catching and easy-to-listen-to\\" songs, she has been described as being one of Indonesia's most sought-after songwriters and composers. Biography Dewiq was born Cynthia Dewi Bayu Wardani in Ujung Pandang, South Sulawesi (now Makassar) on 15 June 1975. She was the youngest of two children born to Indonesian Bambang Yulianto and Dutchwoman Myrna Amy Nigell. She wrote her first song while in elementary school there, later learning to play the guitar and drums in junior and senior high school respectively. After graduating high school, Dewiq joined Red Rose, a Bandung-based band that exclusively played songs by Extreme, Led Zeppelin, and Mr. Big. In 1996, she recorded her first album, Weeq. Weeq was well received, and was followed by two more albums, 1999's Apa Adanya (Just the Way I Am) and 2001's Hanya Manusia Biasa (Just Ordinary People). All three were released by Universal Music. Unable to deal with the hectic schedule of a singer, she made the shift to songwriting. After her shift to songwriting, Dewiq wrote songs for numerous artists, including Malaysian singer Siti Nurhaliza as well as Indonesian singers Bunga Citra Lestari and Agnes Monica. As a way of expressing her gratitude to those who supported her, in 2008 Dewiq released a compilation album entitled Siapa Dewiq? The Hits Maker (Who's Dewiq? The Hits Maker); on the album, she contributed two duets, \\"Koq Gitu Sih?\\" (\\"Why does It Have to be That Way?\\") with TV host Indra Bekti and \\"Be Te\\" (\\"Bad Mood\\") with musician Ipang. The album went on to sell over 100,000 copies. Songwriting style Dewiq notes that she has been heavily influenced by The Beatles and Lenny Kravitz, as well as by her former husband Parlin Burman Siburan. She draws the inspiration for her lyrics from her personal experiences and those of her friends and family, which often result in sad songs. Once she has written the lyrics, the artist or record label that ordered the song are not allowed to change them; changing the music is acceptable. Music wise, she tends to ignore what is trending at the time. Triwik Kurniasari of The Jakarta Post describes her songs as being \\"ear-catching and easy-to-listen-to\\"; she also describes Dewiq as perhaps being the most wanted songwriter and composer in Indonesia. Personal life Dewiq married Parlin Burman Siburan, better known as Pay, a former member of Slank and current member of BIP, in March 2001. The couple secretly divorced in 2007, but only revealed it to the public in 2010 after Pay announced that he would be married to another woman. They continued to have a good relationship, collaborating on songs; Dewiq also attended Pay's second wedding. In 2009, she said that he had \\"taught [her] so much about everything, from music to life\\", citing him as the most influential person in her life.

In East Bengal, the Muslim National Guard was popularly known as the Azrail Bahini.  History  =Foundation= A Muslim National Guard Identity Card issued in Karachi in 1950. The Muslim National Guard was founded in the United Provinces in 1931. The stated goal of the organization was to organize the Muslim youths in order to cultivate among them a spirit of tolerance, sacrifice and discipline. =Revival= The Muslim National Guard was revived at a meeting of the Committee of Action of the Muslim League held at Lahore in 1944. The organization was revamped in all the provinces of British India. In Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, at the inauguration of a training center in Faridpur, stated that those who were getting training at the center would act as the soldiers for the achievement of Pakistan and would save the Muslims from enemy attacks. In 1946, Abdul Monem Khan organized the Muslim National Guard in Mymensingh with 100,000 volunteers and became the Salar-i-Zilla or the commander-in-chief of the district. The members of the National Guard wore distinctive green uniforms with green hats and carried green flags. =Role in Partition violence= On 24 January 1946, the Coalition Government declared both the Muslim National Guard and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh illegal organizations. The private armies were considered a menace to the State and hence won't be tolerated. Ghazarfar Ali opposed the Government decision contending that a ban on the Muslim National Guard was a ban on the most important activities of the Muslim League. On 14 August 1946, two days before the Direct Action Day started in Kolkata, the members of the Muslim National Guards were called upon to assemble at the Muslim Institute at 8:30a.m. During the violence in the Punjab, the Muslim National Guards worked closely with the Khaksars and the Ahrars.  Criticism  Evan Meredith Jenkins, the last British Governor of the Punjab compared the Muslim National Guard to Nazi storm troopers. Historian Rakesh Batabyal draws parallels between fascist methods and the creation of paramilitary forces such as the Muslim National Guard. He observes that Juan Jos√© Linz's analysis of fascist organizations applies: elected political parties using violence against opponents instead of political campaigning was a tragic innovation.

It can be used for both client-side and server-side scripting, where complete programs are written in Opa and subsequently compiled to Node.js on the server and JavaScript on the client, with the compiler automating all communication between the two.Opa actually supports various server-side backends, Nodejs being the most popular one Opa implements strong, static typing, which can be helpful in protecting against security issues such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting attacks. The language was first officially presented at the OWASP conference in 2010, and the source code was released on GitHub in June 2011, under a GNU Affero General Public License. Later, the license changed to the MIT license for the framework part (library) and AGPL for the compiler so that applications written in Opa can be released under any license, proprietary or open source.  Design and features  Opa consists of a web server, a database and distributed execution engine. Code written in Opa is compiled to JavaScript using Node.js on the server side and to JavaScript using jQuery for cross-browser compatibility on the client side. The advantage of the approach compared to certain Rich Internet Application (RIA) platforms is that users are not required to install a plugin in their browser. Opa shares motivations with web frameworks, but takes a different approach. Its designers assert that this helps Opa to avoid many security issues, like SQL injections or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The core language is functional and has a static type system with type inference. Opa also provides sessions which encapsulate an imperative state and communicate using message passing, similar to Erlang processes. Opa provides many structures or functions that are common in web development, as first-class objects, for instance HTML and parsers, based on Parsing Expression Grammars. Because of this adhesion between the language and web-related concepts, Opa is not intended for non-web applications (for instance desktop applications).

She is currently the Playwright in Residence at the Alliance Theatre and at the Just Us Theater Company. In conjunction with her writing, Cleage is also a political activist. She tackles issues at the crux of racism and sexism, and is known for her feminist views, particularly regarding her identity as an African-American woman.Giles, Freda Scott. ‚ÄúThe Motion of Herstory: Three Plays by Pearl Cleage.‚Äù African American Review, vol. 31, no. 4, 1997, pp. 709‚Äì712.

Notably, her novel What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day (1997) was a 1998 Oprah's Book Club selection.\\"Winfrey, Oprah (Gail) 1/29/1954-\\" Encyclopedia of African-American Writing, edited by Shari Dorantes Hatch, Grey House Publishing, 3rd edition, 2018. Credo Reference. Early life and education Pearl Cleage was born on December 7, 1948, in Springfield, Massachusetts, and is the youngest of two daughters of Doris Cleage (n√©e Graham), an elementary school teacher, and Rev. Albert Cleage, founder of the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church and the Shrine of the Black Madonna.Hunter, Jeannine F. \\"Cleage, Pearl.\\" Encyclopedia of African- American Literature, Wilfred D. Samuels, Facts On File, 2nd edition, 2013. Credo Reference. Her father changed his name to Jaramogi Abebe Agyeman in conjunction with the founding of his church. After backlash resulting from her father's radical teachings, the family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where Rev. Cleage became a prominent civil rights leader. Within his church and as a political activist, he fostered a community of black empowerment. Pearl Cleage grew up surrounded by activists in her own family and community. She listened to writers speaking at her father‚Äôs church and met prominent figures of the Civil Rights Movement as they stopped by her house on their way to rallies, both of which were experiences that shaped her future aspirations and career. In an article by Cassandra Spratling, Cleage is described as having been a ‚Äúcurious child,‚Äù always seeking out a story. She knew that she wanted to write since she was two years old. Cleage graduated from Detroit Public Schools in 1966. From 1966-1969, Cleage enrolled at Howard University in Washington, D.C where she studied playwriting and produced two one-act plays as a student. In 1969 she moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where she married politician Michael Lomax, whom she later divorced in 1979.\\"Cleage, Pearl (Michelle) (1st married name: Lomax) 12/7/1948-\\" Encyclopedia of African-American Writing, edited by Shari Dorantes Hatch, Grey House Publishing, 3rd edition, 2018. Credo Reference. In Atlanta, she attended Spelman College, where she attained a bachelor's degree in drama in 1971. Upon graduation from Spelman, Cleage enrolled in graduate school at Atlanta University.  Career  Pearl Cleage always knew she wanted to be a writer and has held the career for 40 years.Playwright Pearl Cleage Opens Up. NPR, Washington, D.C., 2014. ProQuest.Bentley, Rosalind. \\"Pearl Cleage's New Play Takes on Aging and Generation Wars.\\" TCA Regional News, Mar 18, 2019. ProQuest. She has made contributions to the literary world through several mediums as a playwright, essayist, novelist and poet. She takes pride in her ability to write across different genres and enjoys doing so. Prior to pursuing a career in creative writing, in the 1970s, she was the press secretary and speechwriter for Maynard Jackson, Atlanta‚Äôs first Black Mayor. However, she felt constrained in this role as a writer because she was writing the thoughts of someone else. This dissatisfaction prompted her to leave this job and pursue becoming an author. Cleage has help positions at multiple theaters and institutions; from 1986-1991, Cleage was a Cosby Endowed Chair professor at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. She was dubbed the Playwright in Residence at Spelman in 1991. She also spent some time teaching at Smith College. Cleage holds positions as the Playwright in Residence and artistic director of the Just Us Theater Company. In 2013, Cleage became the Playwright in Residence at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta through the National Playwright Residency Program funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and administered by HowlRound. The initial three-year term was renewed for an additional three years in 2016. Cleage is documenting her residency with frequent writings in the HowlRound journal. Not only is Cleage a member of the small niche of African American female playwrights, but it is made even smaller by her age and notable contributions to major theaters. Cleage had her introduction to playwriting in the 1980s, producing her first play, Puppetplay, in 1981, which was followed by Hospice (1983), Good News (1984) and Essentials (1985). In the 1990s, she produced three of her most well-known works (Flyin‚Äô West (1992), Blues for an Alabama Sky (1995) and Bourbon at the Border (1997)) at the Alliance Theatre in partnership with artistic director Kenny Leon. Flyin‚Äô West (1992) has since surpassed a dozen productions all over the country, including a run at the Kennedy Center and other notable productions in New York and Atlanta; it was the most produced new play in 1994. In 1996, Blues for an Alabama Sky (1995) was performed as part of the Cultural Olympiad coinciding with the Summer Olympics held in Atlanta that year. Cleage has also made significant journalistic contributions and is the founder of the literary magazine Catalyst and has been its editor since 1987. In the 1990s, she had a recurring column in the Atlanta Tribune called, ‚ÄúStop Making Sense.‚Äù She has also had articles published in other major newspapers and magazines, including Essence and The New York Times Book Review. Cleage started writing novels in the mid-1990s. She notably writes about topics at the intersection of sexism and racism, specifically on issues such as domestic violence and rape in the black community. She has been a supporter of the Obama administration. Cleage is an activist for AIDS and women's rights, experiences from which she draws for her writings. She also speaks at colleges, universities, and conferences on topics including domestic violence, the citizen's role in a participatory democracy, and writing topics. Personal life In 1969, Cleage married Michael Lomax, an Atlanta politician and past-president of Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. They had a daughter, Deignan Njeri. The marriage ended in divorce in 1979. In 1994, Cleage married Zaron Burnett Jr., writer and director for the Just Us Theater Company. She has four grandchildren. In 2014, Cleage published a compilation of her personal journal entries titled, Things I Should Have Told My Daughter: Lies, Lessons, and Love Affairs, in which chronicles her life from age 11 through the following 18 years. She originally intended to share the entries with her granddaughter. In the book, she boldly chronicles the details of her life from puberty to having an abortion, affairs with married men, and the use of alcohol and other drugs when she felt stuck and out of touch with creativity for her writing. In addition to being a writer, Cleage is also a political activist. She closely identifies with growing up in the 1960s, and the three major social movements of the time (the Civil Rights Movement, Antiwar Movement, and the Women‚Äôs Movement) have closely shaped the themes of her writing.Cleage, Pearl. \\"Standing at the Crossroads.\\" Drama Criticism, edited by Thomas J. Schoenberg and Lawrence J. Trudeau, vol. 32, Gale, 2009. Gale Literature Resource Center. Originally published in Women Writing Plays: Three Decades of the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, edited by Alexis Greene, University of Texas Press, 2006, pp. 100-103. As noted in an article by Frida Scott Giles, Cleage self-identifies as ‚Äúa third[-]generation black nationalist and a radical feminist.‚Äù Through her life and works, Cleage emphasizes and exemplifies the idea of ‚ÄúFree Womanhood,‚Äù a term she coined with its first use in her speech at the Spelman College convocation in 1995.Francis, Aisha. \\"In Search of Free Womanhood: Black Conduct Literature, Contemporary Cultural Production, and Pearl Cleage.\\" Obsidian: Literature in the African Diaspora, vol. 10, no. 1, 2009, p. 32+. Gale Literature Resource Center. Through this theme and way of life, Cleage imparts a message of hope and motivation to Black women in a world where they are victimized from multiple angles. In the introduction to her book, Mad at Miles: A Black Woman‚Äôs Guide to Truth (1990), she states: ‚ÄúI am writing to expose and explore the point where racism and sexism meet. I am writing to help understand the full effects of being black and female in a culture that is both racist and sexist.‚Äù Through the lifestyle of ‚ÄúFree Womanhood,‚Äù she poses tangible and concrete solutions to the unique challenges facing Black women. In an interview for Marita Golden's book The Word: Black Writers Talk about the Transformative Power of Reading and Writing (2011), Cleage mentions her access to an abundance of books written by black people as a factor in her love for reading and writing. Within the interview, Cleage talks about her family expressing the idea that as a writer, she must write about the struggle of black people. She did not find this thought limiting or oppressive. Other inspirations came from her being the owner of a book store and cultural center at one of her fathers‚Äô congregations of The Shrine of the Black Madonna. At the book store artists from the Black Arts Movement would meet. Cleage was inspired by the constant conversations about blackness and was comfortable in her place within the topic. Works Cleage‚Äôs highly anthologized works can be found in Double Stitch (1991), Black Drama in America, New Plays from the Women‚Äôs Project, and Contemporary Plays by Women of Color (1996); Flyin‚Äô West and Other Plays (1999) is a full anthology of all of her plays through the year of its publication. Her works have also been subject to many scholarly analyses and critical essays.Bussey, Jennifer. \\"Critical Essay on What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day.\\" Novels for Students, edited by David A.

Her works have been shaped by the political and social movements of the 1960s, which she experienced first hand. The themes of her writing are fueled by a sense of responsibility to the members of the Black female community, as she writes about the real lives of Black women, inspired by personal experiences and those of women she is close to.Cleage, Pearl, and Douglas Langworthy. \\"Making Our History: An Interview with the Playwright.\\" Drama Criticism, edited by Thomas J. Schoenberg and Lawrence J. Trudeau, vol. 32, Gale, 2009. Gale Literature Resource Center. Originally published in American Theatre, vol. 13, no. 24, July-Aug. 1996, p. 22. Her works have evolved over time to reflect the issues and difficulties facing the community with which she identifies, and, as she gets older, in addition to being Black and being a Women, age becomes part of her identity; these newer challenges are now being reflected in her work, as can be observed in her most recent play: Angry, Raucous and Shamelessly Gorgeous (2019). Many of her novels are set in neighborhoods in Atlanta, Georgia. Cleage does not shy away from showcasing sensitive topics in her works, particularly as they relate to complex issues surrounding race and gender, such as portrayal of domestic violence. These themes are at the center of many of her works, mentionably the plays Flyin‚Äô West (1992), Blues for an Alabama Sky (1995), and Bourbon at the Border (1997). Critics have commented that these works appear to constitute a trilogy, though they are not marketed that way. The same characters appear throughout these three plays, and, as noted in an essay by Benjamin Sammons, they share the common themes of ‚Äúviolence, freedom, and traumatic memory‚Äù present in the lives of Black communities. Cleage introduces these topics as a way to encourage understanding and conversation. Critics have also noted her style of recounting historic events, done not through depictions of well-known figures, but through fictional stories of the lives of everyday people navigating these events. In doing so, she helps people understand their individual unique roles and impacts on history. Though the characters are fictional, Cleage‚Äôs plays are not made up. They represent real stories, lives, and emotions‚Äîparticularly those found in urban African American communities. Cleage is motivated by a sense of responsibility to share the dark truths, while simultaneously imparting a message of hope and love for humanity, embracing all of its flaws. She does not believe in censorship, as it creates an unreal expectation of what life should be, particularly for younger generations of women. She owns the role of openly sharing to young people the realities of good and bad life choices and their effects. Throughout Cleage's work, she has stated her desire to present African American women as they navigate the world daily. An example of this in her work is discussed in Black Feminism in Contemporary Drama (2008) by Lisa Anderson. Anderson talks about Cleage's portrayal of African American women in her play Flyin' West (1992), where Cleage shows formerly enslaved African American women creating a community and working to remain free. Cleage has stated that black women in America are her main audience, but she welcomes all audiences to her work.  Reception  Many of her works across several genres have earned both popular and critical acclaim. They have been applauded in several major publications, including the New York Times, Washington Post, and Essence magazine, as well as recognized by other established writers. She received one of her first awards in 1991 for Outstanding Columnist from the Atlanta Association of Black Journalists. In 1983 she garnered multiple forms of recognition, including five AUDELCO awards for her off-broadway one-act play, Hospice (1983). That same year, she won the Bronze Jubilee Award for Literature and had a record-breaking audience attendance at her productions of Puppetplay (1983). Her novel, What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day (1997), is one of her most recognized works having spent 9 weeks on the New York Times Best Sellers List. It was launched into public recognition in 1998 when it was a pick for Oprah‚Äôs Book Club and later won the Black Caucus of the American Library Association Literary Award. Two of her other novels have also been recognized, one being I Wish I Had a Red Dress (2001), which received an award for Best Work of Fiction from the Georgia Writers Association. Six years later, her novel Baby Brother‚Äôs Blues (2006) was recognized with the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work in the area of fiction in 2007. Most recently, she received the Sankofa Freedom Award in 2010 and the 2013 Theatre Legend Award at the Atlanta Black Theatre Festival in 2013.

Following the success of the programme, it was later repeated on BBC Two so the remainder of the regions could view it. Episodes The series is based around the views of naturalist Chris Packham as he presents his take on what's going wrong and right with Britain's wildlife and conservation techniques. #Farming - An investigation into the state of wildlife on farms and if species are in decline. This includes following a farmer who is giving up on government nature schemes to make more money from cash crops and those committed to wildlife friendly farming. #Coast - Chris travels to Lundy to see how a no-take zone there has benefited undersea creatures and to Lyme Bay to see the impact of a scallop dredging ban. He also investigates both sides of an argument over a proposed new marine conservation zone that may help to protect wildlife in the future. #Episode 3 - In the final episode, Chris investigates Woodland and Heath species. He looks at non-native conifer plantations that do little to aid native wildlife and iconic places like the New Forest and Dartmoor that are suffering loss of habitat. He also asks whether we are spending too much on species like dormice and whether we should concentrate instead on connecting up important habitats like heathland that has been fragmented over the years.

Designed by Sanguinet & Staats and Mauran, Russell, & Crowell, with Westlake Construction Co. as the contractor, it was constructed from 1920 to 1921. It is known as the Hilton Fort Worth. A two-story addition was constructed to the North in 1963, featuring a bank on the ground floor and a new 25,000 sq ft ballroom on the second level.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000966.pdf On November 21, 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy stayed at the hotel in Room 850. The next morning, Kennedy gave what would be his last address in the Crystal Ballroom, just hours before he was assassinated in Dallas. The hotel operated as the Sheraton-Fort Worth Hotel from 1968 until 1979. A major renovation, completed in 1970, coincided with the opening of the Fort Worth Convention Center, making the hotel a \\"headquarters hotel\\" for the center.https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/14000966.htm In the main building, the work involved splitting the original two-story lobby into two floors, with additional meeting rooms on the upper level, and the renovation of the guest rooms, reducing their number to 289. It also included the addition of a new 230-room, 8-floor hotel annex atop a 5-story parking garage built in 1928, across Commerce Street from the hotel and linked to the main building by a skybridge.http://www.star- telegram.com/news/business/article17988329.html The Sheraton closed in 1979 and the hotel was then gutted and restored by architects Jarvis, Putty, Jarvis. The $33 millionhttp://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1985/june/the-short- road-to-success/ restoration involved returning the lobby to its original configuration, the creation of an all-new interior (since there was nothing left of the original interior) featuring an atrium between the wings of the \\"U\\" shaped tower, and the installation of new lighting on the upper levels to resemble the original lighting of the hotel. Following the restoration, the hotel began operating in January 1981 as the Hyatt Regency Fort Worth. The hotel changed management companies in 1995 and operated as the Radisson Fort Worth until March 2006. Under Radisson, the lights on the upper floors were turned off. From 2005 to 2006, the interiors of the hotel were upgraded, and on April 1, 2006, the hotel officially began operating as the Hilton Fort Worth. The annex tower was not converted, but was sold off and left vacant. The Hilton Fort Worth currently contains 294 guest rooms. Part of the new work for the conversion included relighting the top of the building. The Hotel Texas was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 3, 1979. A boundary increase was approved in November 2014 to include the annex as part of the listing. In 2015, plans were announced to convert the annex, empty since 2006, to an apartment building with 140 units. The 188 parking spaces on the first five floors will be re-striped as 260 parking spaces.

Distribution The distribution of Thescelosaurinae is quite large. They are widespread through United States and Canada where most of their fossils have been found. They also have a small group in North-Eastern China and Mongolia. Genera Head and arms of Thescelosaurus, Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center Studies disagree about which genera are included in the Thescelosaurinae. The group is defined to include Parksosaurus and Thescelosaurus and a cladistic analysis by C.M. Brown in 2013 concluded that the genera Changchunsaurus, Haya, Jeholosaurus and possibly Koreanosaurus are also thescelosaurines. Classification All Thescelosaurines were originally included in the family Hypsilophodontidae, which is presently considered polyphyletic (unnatural). They are all now simply considered to be basal Euornithopods. They are the sister taxa to Orodrominae, a group containing Albertadromeus, Orodromeus, Oryctodromeus and Zephyrosaurus. Their parent taxon is Thescelosauridae along with Orodrominae. Currently, all genera originally included in Jeholosauridae are classified in Thescelosaurinae, possibly as a group inside it. If the group of Jeholosaurids is not considered natural than that might mean Jeholosauridae is a synonym of Thescelosaurinae.

Grin studied economics at the University of Geneva, where he obtained a doctorate summa cum laude in 1989. He then was a teacher at the universities of Montreal and Washington (in Seattle), assistant professor at the University of Geneva and vice-director of the European Centre for Minority Issues in Flensburg, Germany. Since 2001 he is a visiting professor at the University of Lugano, in 2003 he became professor at the University of Geneva. In his research, he studies the linguistic situation in Switzerland and in the European Union and its economic consequences. He is the author of a 2005 report entitled L'enseignement des langues √©trang√®res comme politique publique (The teaching of foreign languages as a public policy), best known as Grin's Report. In this document, Grin indicates that the choice of Esperanto as a bridge language for Europe would lead to an annual saving of 25 billion euros. He also suggested a language tax to compensate for the drawbacks of countries whose language is not widespread. Grin has also studied the case of Kalmyk, an oirat language in Russia. Grin's Report In 2005 Fran√ßois Grin wrote Foreign language teaching as public policy, answering a request by the Haut conseil de l'√©ducation. This document attempts to answer the following questions: \\"What foreign languages ought to be taught, for what reasons, and considering what context?\\" It considers the economic costs of language policies, as well as their cultural and policy implications. It examines three scenarios: the choice of a single natural language, the choice of three natural languages and the choice of a constructed language, Esperanto. This report has not resulted in real changes in the language policy of any State. The report suggests that use of English gives unfair redistribution to Anglophones. A set of three, e.g. French, German and English, would reduce inequalities among speakers, but still impose a burden on those whose first language is not among those chosen. A further problem is the choice of languages for the trio (and the criteria for choosing them). The report argues that adoption of Esperanto would save the EU 25 billion euros a year. Grin suggests that adoption of Esperanto as a working language is unlikely given prejudices against the language, but that such a move may be achieved in the long term. Economists Adriana Vintean and Ovidiu Matiu suggested in 2008 that adoption of Esperanto would likely lead to large savings for Europe, but that teaching Esperanto would be a major expense for poorer EU nations such as Romania or Bulgaria.

The monument includes a 15 foot tall base topped by a bronze statue of General Wayne flanked by figures of a Native American scout and a frontiersman.

Plot Barry Manton, William Carter, the son of Sir James, falls in love with a dancer, Bebe Doree but his father disapproves and bribes Bebe to disappear. Hurt, Barry leaves home and becomes a labourer on the docks. He meets poor but honest Lola Quayle in a cabaret and offers her a place to live after she resists the advances of a pub owner. They stay in separate rooms but fall in love during a storm and he later marries her. Barry's father wants him to return home and sends a solicitor over to approach him. Not wanting to get between Barry and his family, Lola runs away. Years later, Barry lives in an attic, having rejected wealth and position and taken to drink, while Lola works as a nurse, looking after their son, Peter.

They came up with the story in the prep room of their own boarding school. Says Phyllis McDonagh: > In those days every Australian-made film made us out to be a lot of > bushwhackers, on the 'Dad and Dave' theme. The three of us talked and talked > and decided if Australia was going to compete overseas we'd have to meet > overseas standards by making interior films ‚Äì technically difficult then. The film was entirely financed by the girl's father. Says Phyllis: > Father always believed in us. And when we proved on paper we knew what we > were about, he let us have our head. We had a down-to-earth approach. We > thought well ahead and planned the details meticulously. We knew talent > wasn't enough if it was half baked. The McDonaghs formed a production company, MCD Productions, and started pre- production. Isobel was to star, Phyllis was to do production design and publicity, and Paulette would help with direction. Before filming commenced, their father died of a heart attack. Their mother was a trained nurse and a group of Sydney doctors suggested she open a convalescent home for their use. The family moved into \\"Drummoyne House\\", a 22 room house in the Sydney suburb of Drummoyne built by convicts. Two wings were set aside for the convalescent home and another section was turned into a film studio. The McDonaghs originally hired P.J. Ramster to direct but were unhappy with his work and replaced him with Paulette. The interiors were shot mostly at the home in Drummoyne, with additional scenes filmed at the Bondi studios of Australasian Films and exteriors done around Sydney. Shooting took four weeks in all. A number of days were lost when the cast and crew's eyes were damaged from the lights, and their cinematographer fell ill with influenza. Release The film was given a vice-regal premiere in September 1926 attended by Governor Sir Dudley de Chair, whose daughter Elaine had a part in the film. Dr McDonagh had been J.C. Williamson's surgeon and the film was distributed commercially by J.C. Williamson Ltd It performed well at the box office, with Phyllis McDonagh later claiming the movie earned twice its cost. Gregory Balcombe of Union Theatres said his company distributed the film to help the local industry, although it should not have cost more than ¬£1,000.

Hall who claimed he had never seen the 1926 Tall Timber.Philip Taylor, 'Ken G. Hall', Cinema Papers January 1974 p 83 Synopsis Jack Maxwell, son of a wealthy stockbroker, is disowned by his father after a raucous party, and goes to work at a mill in the North Coast timber district owned by his friend Dick Desmond. He falls in love with Betty Manning, the daughter of the widow who cooks for the workers, and clashes with Steve Black, the ganger of the mill who is behind a spate of timber robberies, who also loves Betty. A sundowner arrives in camp and shoots Steve in revenge for seducing the sundowner's wife years ago. He also reveals Steve has been blackmailing Dick's father for a murder for which he can now be proved innocent. Jack saves the mill from a robbery and is offered a partnership from Desmond.

Bush. resigned to prepare for his presidential inauguration. Perry became the first Texas A&M; graduate to serve as governor. Perry was a member of the Republican Governors Association, the National Governors Association, the Western Governors Association, and the Southern Governors Association. Perry served as Chairman of the Republican Governors Association in 2008 and 2011. Perry's public relations office promoted the position that he advocated an emphasis on accountability, raised expectations, and funded programs that worked to improve the quality of Texas schools. Perry's campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor focused on a tough stance on crime. In June 2002, he vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally retarded inmates. He has also supported block grants for crime programs. Perry has also supported tort reform to limit malpractice lawsuits against doctors, and as lieutenant governor he had tried and failed to limit class action awards and allowing plaintiffs to allocate liability awards among several defendants. In 2003, Perry sponsored a controversial state constitutional amendment to cap medical malpractice awards,Blumenthal, Ralph. \\"Malpractice Suits Capped at $750,000 in Texas Vote\\" The New York Times September 15, 2003 which was narrowly approved by voters. According to a tort reform advocate, this legislation has resulted in a 21.3 percent decrease in malpractice insurance rates. According to the Texas Medical Board, there has also been a significant increase in the number of doctors seeking to practice in the state. Perry has drawn attention for his criticism of the Obama administration's handling of the recession, and for turning down approximately $555 million in stimulus money for unemployment insurance. Perry was lauded by the Texas Public Policy Foundation for this decision and his justification ‚Äì that the funds and the mandatory changes to state law would have placed an enduring tax burden on employers. In September 2009, Perry declared that Texas was recession-proof: \\"As a matter of fact ... someone had put a report out that the first state that's coming out of the recession is going to be the state of Texas ... I said, 'We're in one?Perry on Recession: \\"We're in one?\\" Political Wire, September 19, 2009 Paul Burka, senior executive editor of Texas Monthly, criticized Perry's remarks, saying \\"You cannot be callous and cavalier when people are losing their jobs and their homes.\\"Burka, Paul (September 18, 2009). \\"Let them eat chili\\". Texas Monthly. Retrieved November 11, 2016. The Los Angeles Times reported on August 16, 2011, that Perry received $37 million over 10 years from just 150 donors, which adds up to over a third of the $102 million he had raised as governor through December 2010, according to the group Texans for Public Justice. Almost half of those donors received big contracts, tax breaks or appointments during Perry's tenure. On July 8, 2013, Perry announced he would not seek reelection to an unprecedented fourth full four-year term in the election in November 2014, during a press conference at Holt Caterpillar in San Antonio, Texas with family and friends present. Elections =2002= Perry won the office in his own right in the 2002 gubernatorial election when he defeated Laredo businessman Tony Sanchez, polling 2,632,591 votes (57.80 percent) to Sanchez's 1,819,798 (39.96 percent). Four minor party candidates shared 2.21 percent of the vote. =2006= Rick Perry touring Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, Texas, on August 28, 2004 The 2006 gubernatorial election proved to be a stiffer challenge for Perry than his 2002 campaign. Though he easily defeated token opposition in the primary election, Perry faced three major opponents: former Democratic Congressman Chris Bell, as well as two major independent candidates ‚Äì outgoing Republican state Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn) and well-known Texas country music singer Kinky Friedman. Perry won the race in a plurality, polling 1,714,618 votes (39 percent) to Bell's 1,309,774 (29.8 percent), Strayhorn's 789,432 (18 percent), Friedman's 553,327 (12.6 percent), with a Libertarian candidate and a write-in independent garnering another 27,444 votes (0.6 percent). Perry became only the third governor in state history to have been elected by a plurality of less than 40 percent of votes cast (the 1853 and 1861 races also featured plurality winners carrying under 40 percent). Late in the 2006 campaign, the Republican Governors Association received one million dollars from Houston businessman Bob Perry (no relation), and the association thereafter contributed the same amount to Rick Perry. Bell brought suit, contending that the Bob Perry donations had been improperly channeled through the association to conceal their source. In 2010, the Rick Perry campaign paid Bell $426,000 to settle the suit. =2010= Perry in September 2010 In April 2008, Perry announced his intent to run for re- election. Perry defeated Senator Hutchison and Debra Medina in the March 2, 2010, primary election, becoming the Republican nominee. He faced Democratic nominee William Howard \\"Bill\\" White, the former mayor of Houston. During the general election campaign, Perry refused to debate White until White released his tax returns from 1995, his last year as deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration. White released his tax returns for his six years as mayor of Houston. According to his spokesperson, White had taxes withheld from his $133,000 salary in 1995, the amount of which was offset by losses in the starting of an energy business. On November 2, 2010, Perry handily won re- election to an unprecedented third four-year term in the general election. He carried 226 out of 254 counties and polled 2,733,784 votes (54.97 percent) to White's 2,102,606 votes (42.28 percent). Perry made history by becoming the first Texas governor to be elected to three four-year terms and the fourth to serve three terms since Shivers, Price Daniel, and John Connally; his third term began on January 18, 2011. The Koch network gave Rick Perry $76 000 in 2010, in relation to the Texas Gubernatorial elections. Economy Since the beginning of his presidential campaign, Perry has made what he calls the economic success of Texas the centerpiece of his campaign. According to Perry and his supporters, the state economy has improved as a result of his policy, including the lack of an income tax and predictable regulation. Others, meanwhile, have questioned whether the Texan economy is truly as successful as Perry claims.The Texas Unmiracle By PAUL KRUGMAN, The New York Times, August 14, 2011 As of August 2011, Texas has an 8.2% unemployment rate.The Texas Unmiracle In comparison, the national unemployment rate was 9.1% in August 2011. 25 states have a lower unemployment rate than Texas, and 25 states (including the District of Columbia) have a higher unemployment rate, meaning that Texas has median unemployment among U.S. states. Between June 2009 and August 2011, 237,000 jobs were created in Texas. But when comparing population growth to the unemployment rate the influx of new job seekers has caused the UI rate to appear to be changing only slowly, when in fact the job creation rate has kept pace, or exceeded the influx of new population. According to a March 28, 2011 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 9.54% of hourly-paid workers in Texas are paid at or below minimum wage. In comparison, the national percentage is 6.0%. Among the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, Texas has the highest percentage of workers paid at or below minimum wage; the state with the second-highest percentage is Mississippi, with 9.50%. As of 2011, 26% of the Texan population does not have health insurance. In comparison, the statistic among the entire U.S. is 17%. Paul Krugman, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, attributed Texas' job growth to its growing population, which he said decreased wages and attracted businesses to the state. According to Krugman, the high population growth in the state was due to a high birth rate, immigration from Mexico, and internal migration of other Americans, due to the warm weather and low cost of living ‚Äì especially the low housing prices from less restrictive zoning policies, which he described as the \\"one area where Texas does in fact do something right.\\" Perry's defenders responded by stating that the median hourly wage is 93% of the national average, and wages have increased at 3.4% in 2010 Several of the business leaders who moved to Texas have ascribed their decision partly to business-friendly policies (including the lack of income tax, low regulation, anti-union laws, and financial incentives), and partly to the convenient Texas geography in the middle of the country with transportation hubs, a large bilingual population, mild winters and abundant space.Policy, Geography Boost Texas Job Growth By ANA CAMPOY, The Wall Street Journal, August 22, 2011 Fiscal policy Perry, a proclaimed proponent of fiscal conservatism, has often campaigned on tax reform and job growth. Perry opposed creating a Texas state income tax and increasing sales tax rates, choosing instead to increase user fees and debt, adding $2 billion for road bonds, borrowing from the Federal Unemployment Trust Fund and adding surcharges to various traffic offenses, protected the state's \\"Rainy Day fund\\", balanced the state budget as required by state law, and was reelected on a platform to reduce property taxes that rose with the inflation of property values in the late 1990s and the 21st century. As Governor of Texas, Perry received grades of B in 2004, B in 2006, B in 2008, B in 2010, C in 2012, and B in 2014 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. =Tax policy= In 2002, although his Democratic opponent pledged to never raise taxes, Perry refused to make such a promise.Gleckman, Howard (August 16, 2011). \\"Rick Perry's Changing Take On Raising Taxes\\". Forbes. In 2009, however, Perry signed Grover Norquist's pledge to \\"oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes\\". In early 2006, Perry signed legislation that delivered a $15.7 billion reduction in property taxes while raising other taxes such as a state franchise tax. The tax was condemned as a \\"back door\\" state income tax by many organizations.\\"New Texas Margin Tax ‚Äì Business or Income Tax\\" . accountingweb.com. August 16, 2006. Retrieved August 18, 2011 Perry claimed that the bill would save the average taxpayer $2,000 in property taxes. Critics contended that Perry inflated these numbers; the actual tax savings, some sources said, would average only $150 per family in the first year, and $1,350 over a three-year period. In 2004, Perry proposed a number of tax increases to pay for public schools, including a tax on strip clubs.\\"The Texas pole tax\\". The Economist. January 3, 2008. The \\"pole tax\\" idea went nowhere until 2007, when the Legislature approved a $5 per patron fee. The measure subsequently became tied up in litigation as the adult entertainment industry sued citing performers' First Amendment rights.Ramshaw, Emily (June 23, 2011). \\"Advocates Say Change to Strip Club Fee is Dead\\". The Texas Tribune. =Industrial policy= In 2003, Perry signed legislation that created the Texas Enterprise Fund to enhance the development of the Texas economy. In 2004, he authorized the fund to grant $20 million to Countrywide Financial in return for a promise \\"to create 7,500 new jobs in the state by 2010.\\" Critics argue those jobs would have been created with or without tax payer money. The grant (all of which are approved by the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House) is one of the largest made from the fund in terms of the size and the number of jobs promised. In the fall of 2007, while slashing jobs and with its stock price plummeting, Countrywide assured Perry's office that the company \\"believed\\" it would meet its 2010 commitmentAustin American-Statesman, November 9, 2007, page D1 only to be acquired in a fire sale two months later by Bank of America. Thanks to the \\"claw-back\\" provisions in the program, grantees return funds to the state for jobs not created. The Texas Enterprise Fund has given $435 million in grants to businesses since 2003. The Texas Emerging Technology Fund has given nearly $200 million to businesses since 2005. The New York Times reported that more than a quarter of the companies that have received grants from the enterprise fund in the most recent fiscal year, or their chief executives, made contributions to either Mr. Perry's campaign dating back to 2001 or to the Republican Governors Association since 2008. For example, John McHale, Austin, Texas, gave millions of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes, but 2 years ago wrote a $50,000 check to Perry, then seeking a third term as governor, and in September 2010, wrote another $50,000 check. In May 2010 an economic development fund administered by the governor's office gave $3 million to G-Con, a pharmaceutical start-up that Mr. McHale helped start. At least two other executives with connections to G-Con had also given Mr. Perry tens of thousands of dollars.Perry Mines Texas System to Raise Cash, by Nicholas Confessore and Michael Lu, The New York Times, August 20, 2011 Perry has appointed at least four top donors or fund-raisers to the board of the Teacher Retirement System, a $110 billion pension fund. Perry's trustees encouraged the fund to invest more money with hedge funds and private equity firms whose investors, officers, or partners were Perry donors. =Staff expenses= In June 2010, Perry went on a 12-day trade mission to East Asia. The security detail for the trip cost $129,000 in state money. The Texas Government attempted to block the media's scrutiny of the use of the funds as they contained information that could compromise the future security of the state's senior executive. A member of White's gubernatorial campaign stated that Perry should, \\"stop hiding the facts on fiscal issues like what he's charging taxpayers for travel\\". Perry's campaign countered that the trip led to greater exposure for Texas business opportunities in Asia. In all, Perry made 23 foreign trips from 2004 to 2010, including a vacation on Grand Cayman and an education policy retreat in The Bahamas. The state paid only 1% of the travel expenses for these excursions, but security details for all trips combined cost over $1 million in state money. Perry's chief of staff remarked that the trips were \\"good business sense\\" as they enhanced the profile of Texan goods and services in foreign markets. White's campaign, however, accused Perry of staging the trips for self-promotion. Social policy Perry is pro-life and opposes government funding for elective abortions. In 2003, Perry signed the Prenatal Protection Act, which explicitly included fetuses in its definition of human life. In 2005, Perry, a social conservative, signed a bill that limited late-term abortions and required girls under the age of 18 who procure abortions to notify their parents. Perry signed the bill in the gymnasium of Calvary Christian Academy in Fort Worth, an evangelical Christian school. In 2005, Perry signed a parental consent bill into law. Perry has signed legislation prohibiting abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy, and has also signed into law a bill that required abortion providers to offer informational brochures to women considering abortion. In May 2011, Perry signed a \\"Mandatory Ultrasound Bill\\" which stipulates that, prior to every abortion, the abortion practitioner or a certified sonographer must perform a sonogram before any sedative or anesthesia is administered. Before every abortion, the abortion practitioner must give an explanation of the sonogram images of the unborn child. The woman has the right to waive the explanation only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormality, and judicial bypass for a minor. The abortion practitioner must also allow the woman to see the sonogram images of the unborn child and hear the heartbeat along with a verbal explanation of the heartbeat before an abortion can be administered. Critics stated that the law was \\"government intrusion\\", pointing out that in the first trimester, only transvaginal sonograms (in which a probe is inserted up the woman's vagina) can be performed, and stated that such a procedure would be inappropriate for victims of incest or rape, which the law does not exempt.Democrats derail sonogram bill, at least for a day Also in 2011, Perry signed a bill that prohibited taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, along with a bill that created a \\"Choose Life\\" license plate to promote infant adoption in Texas. =HPV vaccine controversy= On February 2, 2007, Perry issued an executive order mandating that Texas girls receive HPV vaccine that protects against some strains of the human papilloma virus, a contributing factor to some forms of cervical cancer.Carney, Timothy (June 21, 2011) \\"Rick Perry's mixed record on regulatory robbery\\", The Washington Examiner The order provided vaccination free of charge to those who were not covered by insurance,Texas Gov. Orders Anti-Cancer Vaccine The Washington Post, February 2, 2007, Liz Austin PETERSON and included an opt-out provision for parents. At the time of the order, Gardasil, a newly approved drug manufactured by Merck, was the only HPV vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The move made national headlines, and apparent financial connections between Merck and Perry were reported by news outlets, such as a $6,000 campaign contribution and Merck's hiring of former Perry Chief of Staff Mike Toomey to handle its Texas lobbying work and Perry's \\"current chief of staff's mother-in-law, Texas Republican state Rep. Dianne White Delisi [as] state director for Women in Government\\". Perry's decision was criticized by some social conservatives and parents due to concerns about possible moral implications of the vaccine and safety concerns. On February 22, 2007, a group of families sued in an attempt to block Perry's executive order. In May 2007, the Texas Legislature passed a bill to undo Perry's executive order. Perry did not veto it, saying the Legislature would have sufficient time and votes to override his veto. Gun ownership Perry has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association. He possesses a Concealed Handgun License (CHL), and in 2005, he signed a number of bills that, among other things, reduced CHL fees for military veterans and senior citizens, reduced the CHL age requirement from 21 to 18 for members of the military, exempted military veterans from taking the range portion of the CHL licensing process (if they had been weapons certified in the military within the past five years), and extended the renewal period for a CHL from four to five years. In 2007, Perry signed castle doctrine legislation, enhancing a person's legal right to use deadly force in self-defense against an intruder within one's place of residence. In 2011, Perry criticized the U.S. Department of Justice's creation of a reporting requirement for purchases of semi-automatic rifles within the four states bordering Mexico, saying \\"... the Obama administration should target actual criminals rather than law- abiding citizens and immediately secure our southern border against the northbound and southbound illegal smuggling of drugs, humans, cash, guns, fugitives and stolen vehicles.\\" Vetoes Perry set a record in the 2001 legislative session for the use of the veto: he rejected legislation a total of 82 times, more than any other governor in any single legislative session in the history of the state since Reconstruction. Perry's use of the veto drew criticism from some in the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, having used the veto only nine fewer times than preceding Governor George W. Bush had during three legislative sessions and 22 times more than Ann Richards cast in two sessions.\\"The Executive Branch: Budgetary Powers\\" , Texas Politics, University of Texas at Austin. Retrieved June 20, 2011 In the two legislative sessions following the 2001 session, Perry was more conservative in his use of the veto, employing it 51 times.\\"The Limits of the Veto\\" , Texas Politics, University of Texas at Austin. Retrieved June 20, 2011 As of 2011, he had used the veto 273 times, more than any other Texas governor. Trans-Texas Corridor In January 2001, Perry proposed the Trans-Texas Corridor, a $145+ billion-dollar project that would build multi-lane highways, rail lines and data lines from Oklahoma to Mexico, and from east to west in southern Texas. Instead of paying for the project with taxes, Perry proposed that it be partially financed, partially built and wholly operated by private contractors who, in exchange for a multibillion-dollar investment, would receive all toll proceeds, notably Cintra, a Spanish-owned company, and its minority partner, San Antonio-based Zachry Construction Corporation, one of Texas' largest road construction companies. Some of the more controversial aspects of the project include tolls, private operation of toll collections (at rates set by local municipalities), and extensive use of eminent domain (or the option for landowners to maintain a lucrative equity stake in the project) to acquire property. Opponents portrayed the proposal as a \\"land grab\\", and criticized Perry for opposing the public release of the actual terms of the 50-year deal with Cintra to the public for fear they would chill the possibility of the company's investment; Perry's former liaison to the legislature, former State Senator Dan Shelly, returned to his consulting/lobbying work with Cintra after securing the TTC deal while on the state payroll. All of Perry's gubernatorial opponents opposed the corridor project, as did the 2006 state party platforms of both the Democratic and Republicans parties. After much contentious debate between supporters and opponents, an official decision of \\"no action\\" was issued by the Federal Highway Administration on July 20, 2010, formally ending the project. In 2001, Perry appointed Ric Williamson of Weatherford, an old friend and former legislative colleague, to the Texas Transportation Commission. Williamson became the commission chairman in 2004 and worked for the improvement of the state's transportation infrastructure until his sudden death of a heart attack on December 30, 2007. Death penalty Perry supports the death penalty. On June 2, 2009, Texas carried out the 200th execution since Perry assumed the office of governor. As of August 10, 2011, Texas has carried out 234 executions since Rick Perry became governor. Under the Texas Constitution, the governor is not permitted to grant pardon, parole, or to commute a death penalty sentence to life imprisonment on his own initiative (the Constitution was changed in 1936 due to concerns that pardons were being sold for cash under the administrations of former Governor James E. Ferguson and later his wife and Texas' first female Governor Miriam A. Ferguson).Texas State Libraries and Archives Commission: \\"Pardons and Paroles\\" retrieved October 20, 2011. Instead, all requests for pardon, parole, and commutation are channeled through the Board of Pardons and Paroles who then reviews each application and makes a recommendation to the governor. Although the Governor can accept or reject a positive recommendation of commutation or pardon from the Board of Pardons and Paroles, he has no power to override a negative recommendation. The only unilateral action which the Governor can take is to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve to the defendant.Texas Administrative Code Title 37 PUBLIC SAFETY AND CORRECTIONS, Part 5 TEXAS BOARD OF PARDONS AND PAROLES, Chapter 143 EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY, Subchapter E COMMUTATION OF SENTENCE, Rule 143.57 Commutation of Death Sentence to Lesser Penalty retrieved August 20, 2011The Texas Constitution: Sec. 11.

The Governor shall have the power to grant one reprieve in any capital case for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days; and he shall have power to revoke conditional pardons. With the advice and consent of the Legislature, he may grant reprieves, commutations of punishment and pardons in cases of treason.\\" retrieved August 20, 2011 =Execution of Cameron Todd Willingham= Cameron Todd Willingham was a Texas man whose three young children died in a 1991 fire at the family home in Corsicana, Texas. Willingham, accused of having set the fire, was convicted of murder and was executed in 2004. Shortly before the execution and after several years of unsuccessful appeals, arson expert Gerald Hurst filed a report advising the 7-member Board of Pardons and Paroles that the investigation of the case had not been based on good science and that there was no proof of arson, but the Board of Pardons and Paroles declined to recommend clemency to the governor. Perry did not use his authority to grant a one-time, 30-day reprieve to Willingham. Willingham's case gained renewed attention in 2009 after The New Yorker published a story that drew upon the investigations of Hurst and anti-death penalty advocate Elizabeth Gilbert. In 2005, Texas established a nine-member Texas Forensic Science Commission (TFSC). As part of the Commission's inquiry into the Willingham case, another fire scientist wrote a report that agreed with Gerald Hurst that the charge of arson could not be sustained given the available evidence. Two days before the Commission was to hold a hearing on this report, Perry replaced three of members of the TFSC. Perry's newly appointed Chairman promptly canceled the hearing. Perry denied that the dismissals were related to the case, noting that the terms of the replaced persons were expiring. In July 2011, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott ruled that the commission did not have jurisdiction to investigate evidence in cases that occurred before the panel was created in 2005, thus implying that a Commission conclusion regarding the forensic science used in the Willingham case would not be forthcoming. =Execution of Mexican nationals= Two Mexican nationals have been executed under the Perry administration ‚Äì Jos√© Medell√≠n in 2008 for the 1993 murder of Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pe√±a, and Humberto Leal Garcia in 2011 for the 1994 rape, torture, and murder of Adria Sauceda. At the time of their arrests in the early 1990s, neither had been informed that as Mexican nationals they have the right to inform the Mexican Consulate of the charges and ask for legal assistance. A 2004 ruling by the International Court of Justice concluded that the U.S. had violated the rights of 51 Mexican nationals, including Medellin and Garcia, under the terms of a treaty the U.S. had signed. In response to the ruling, the Bush administration issued an instruction that states comply, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he had exceeded his authority. The Supreme Court also ruled in Medellin v. Texas that the treaty was not binding on states until Congress enacted statutes to implement it, and in Leal Garcia v. Texas declined to place a stay on the executions to allow Congress additional time to enact such a statute. A 2008 ruling by the International Court of Justice asked the United States to place a stay on the executions, but Texas officials stated that they were not bound by international law. Garcia supporters complained about the use of controversial techniques such as bite mark analysis and luminol in determining his guilt. Garcia however, confessed responsibility for his crimes, and apologized before his execution. Regarding the Garcia execution, Perry stated that \\"If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws.\\" =Pardons and commutations= In 2005, Frances Newton's appeal for a commutation of her death penalty was declined. Her attorney had argued Newton was incapable of standing trial. The Board of Pardon and Parole did not recommend a commutation, and Perry did not grant the one-time reprieve. Newton was executed on September 14, 2005. In 1990, Tyrone Brown was sentenced to life in a Texas maximum security prison for smoking marijuana while on probation. Texas Judge Keith Dean had originally placed Brown on probation, but changed the sentence after Brown tested positive for marijuana. After being defeated in the last Dallas election, Dean requested the governor pardon Brown. On March 9, 2007, Perry granted Brown a conditional pardon after receiving a recommendation from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. On August 30, 2007, Perry commuted the death sentence of Kenneth Foster, an accomplice in a 1996 murder, doing so three hours before Foster was to die by lethal injection. Evidence had shown that while Foster was present at the scene of the crime (transporting the individual who actually committed the crime away from the scene in his car), he had nothing to do with the actual commission of the murder, and may not have even been aware that it had been taking place, as he was outside in his car at the time. The Board of Pardon and Parole recommended commutation, and Perry accepted the recommendation, converting the sentence to life in prison with a possibility of parole in 2037.\\"Governor Commutes Sentence in Texas\\", The New York Times, August 31, 2007 Education As lieutenant governor, Perry initially sponsored a controversial school voucher bill as an alternative to the \\"Robin Hood\\" school finance proposal. In 2004, Perry attacked the same \\"Robin Hood\\" plan as detrimental to the educational system and attempted to get the legislature to replace it with one that he said would encourage greater equity, cost less, hold down property and sales taxes, and foster job growth. Perry supported the legalization of video lottery terminals at racetracks and on Indian reservations as well as increases in cigarette taxes. A special session of the legislature was convened on June 21, 2005, to address education issues, but resistance developed from House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican from Midland. Perry's proposal was attacked by members from property-poor districts and was rejected. During the session, Perry became involved in a heated debate with Comptroller Carole Strayhorn about the merits of his school finance proposal. Strayhorn initially planned to oppose Perry in the 2006 Republican primary, but she instead ran as an independent in the general election. Another special session was convened on July 21, 2005, after Perry vetoed all funding for public schools for the 2007‚Äì2008 biennium. He vowed not to \\"approve an education budget that shortchanges teacher salary increases, textbooks, education technology, and education reforms. And I cannot let $2 billion sit in some bank account when it can go directly to the classroom.\\" Perry's campaign office in 2006 declared that without the special session, some \\"$2 billion that had been intended for teacher pay raises, education reforms, and other school priorities would have gone unused because House Bill 2 [the public school reform package] didn't pass.\\" The bill failed to pass in the first session, and was refiled in a second session, in which the bill was defeated 62‚Äì79, after 50 amendments were added without discussion or debate. Late in 2005, to maximize the impact of a bipartisan education plan, Perry asked his former rival in the race for lieutenant governor, John Sharp‚Äîa former Texas State Comptroller and a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, Texas State Senate and Texas House of Representatives‚Äîto head an education task force charged with preparing a bipartisan education plan. Sharp accepted Perry's offer and removed himself as a potential candidate for governor in 2006. The task force issued its final plan several months later, and the legislature adopted it. For his successful efforts, Sharp was later nominated by The Dallas Morning News for the \\"Texan of the Year\\" award. In 2007, Perry vetoed government provided health insurance for community college faculty due to revelations that schools had been using state funds to pay benefits for non-state employees. Funding for state-employed school personnel was restored in a joint agreement and funding re-allocation later that same year. In June 2011, Perry signed into law Senate Bill 1736, which establishes the \\"College Credit for Heroes\\" program. The new law is intended to help veterans get college credit for military training. As of 2011, Texas still ranks at the bottom of many educational indicators.

Texas Democrats, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and other detractors of Perry have criticized him regarding Texas schools' performance and class size.Big Country superintendents critical of academic rankings ¬ª Abilene Reporter-News Pay increases for Texas's teachers have not kept up with the national average. Inauguration concert controversy Perry invited his friend, rock musician Ted Nugent, to perform at a black-tie gala hours after Perry's second inauguration ceremony on January 16, 2007. Nugent appeared onstage during the inaugural ball wearing a cutoff T-shirt emblazoned with the Confederate flag and shouting derogatory remarks about non-English speakers, according to press reports.Pierce, Greg. \\"Inside Politics\\", The Washington Times, January 19, 2007, page A7. The NAACP condemned Nugent's wearing the Confederate flag. Perry's spokesman, Robert Black, downplayed the Tuesday- night incident. \\"Ted Nugent is a good friend of the governor's. He (Perry) asked him (Nugent) if he would play at the inaugural. He didn't put any stipulation of what he would play.\\"\\"Rocker Ted Nugent Creates Stir With Performance at Inaugural Ball for Texas Governor Rick Perry\\" Fox News, Associated Press, January 18, 2007 Congressional redistricting In 2003, Perry called three consecutive special legislative sessions to procure a congressional redistricting plan he said would be more reflective of the state's population. The plan finally adopted‚Äîsupported by then U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Sugar Land‚Äîbrought about a five-seat Republican gain in the delegation. In 2006, however, the five-seat edge was reduced to three seats. Thereafter, Republicans gained one seat in 2008 and an additional three seats in the 2010 election; they now hold a 23‚Äì9 majority. Texas and states' rights In April 2009, Perry endorsed a resolution in support of states' rights under Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, reaffirming that power that is not delegated to the federal government by the U.S. Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States. In his speech, Perry stated \\"A number of recent federal proposals are not within the scope of the federal government's constitutionally designated powers and impede the states' right to govern themselves. HCR 50 affirms that Texas claims sovereignty under the 10th Amendment over all powers not otherwise granted to the federal government. \\". On April 9, 2009, Perry said, \\"I believe that our federal government has become oppressive in its size, its intrusion into the lives of our citizens, and its interference with the affairs of our State. That is why I am here today to express my unwavering support for efforts all across our country to reaffirm the States' rights affirmed by the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I believe that returning to the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution and its essential 10th Amendment will free our State from undue regulations, and ultimately strengthen our Union.\\" Similar legislation has been passed by other states. After a Tea Party rally held on April 15, 2009, Perry told a group of reporters: > Texas is a unique place. When we came into the union in 1845, one of the > issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that ... My > hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We've got > a great union. There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if > Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, who knows > what may come of that. Perry's statement was widely interpreted as raising the possibility of the secession of Texas from the union, and was criticized on that basis. A spokesperson for Perry said that Perry \\"never advocated seceding\\". Perry's statement that Texas, in joining the union, had reserved the right to leave was also widely disputed.What's All That Secession Ruckus in Texas?, Time, April 17, 2009 Immigration In 2001, Perry expressed his pride in the enactment of the statute extending in-state tuition to children of undocumented workers. He said: > We must say to every Texas child learning in a Texas classroom, \\"we don't > care where you come from, but where you are going, and we are going to do > everything we can to help you get there.\\" And that vision must include the > children of undocumented workers. That's why Texas took the national lead in > allowing such deserving young minds to attend a Texas college at a resident > rate. Perry has opposed the creation of the Mexico ‚Äì United States barrier, which is meant to keep out illegal aliens. Instead of barricading the border completely with a fence, Perry believes that the federal government should fulfill its responsibility to its citizens by securing the borders with \\"boots on the ground\\" and technology to improve safety while not harming trade with the state's biggest trading partner, Mexico. Perry said the Arizona immigration law SB 1070 \\"would not be the right direction for Texas\\" and would distract law enforcement from fighting other crimes. During a large surge in illegal immigration through the U.S. southern border in the summer of 2014, Perry criticized U.S. President Barack Obama, saying that the surge was \\"a humanitarian crisis that he has the ability to stop.\\" On July 21, 2014, Perry announced he would send in 1,000 National Guard troops to secure the border. Although illegal immigration levels declined over 70% after Perry deployed the National Guard, PolitiFact.com rated his claim that the decline resulted from the surge as \\"mostly false.\\" Human Trafficking The State Department estimates that one in five victims of human trafficking in the US pass through Texas. Perry has consistently spoken out against human trafficking in Texas, saying: > Human traffickers exploit their victims' hopes and dreams, promising better > days and better lives but delivering them instead into a world that's > nothing more than modern-day slavery. Hopefully, when human traffickers > understand their own freedom and profits are on the line, perhaps for the > rest of their lives, they will think twice about continuing to engage in > these criminal activities. Perry has signed several bills that both target traffickers and provide services to victims. In 2009 Perry created the Human Trafficking Prevention Task Force, a group that collects information on trafficking and makes recommendations to combat it. Anti-trafficking legislation signed by Perry includes creation of rescue hotlines for victims and increased prison sentences for traffickers.  Response to 2011 drought and wildfires  On April 21, 2011, Perry proclaimed a three-day period, from April 22 to 24, as \\"Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas\\" in response to the wildfires then covering much of the state.\\"Gov. Perry Issues Proclamation for Days of Prayer for Rain in Texas\\", The Office of the Governor, April 21, 2011. Retrieved June 30, 2011 By late July, 75% of the state was experiencing exceptional drought conditions, as opposed to 10‚Äì20% in April. Indictment On August 15, 2014, Perry was indicted for abuse of power as he threatened to veto funding for state public corruption prosecutors; this might constitute an obstacle to his presidential aspirations. Environment Perry opposed the regulation of greenhouse gases as pollutants; a spokesman for Perry cited \\"unsettled science\\" regarding climate change. Under Perry Texas sued the Obama administration to overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations.

Cursed for Gold Director's bio Overview A new gold rush is sweeping through the Amazon rainforest where scores of women and men hunt for nuggets and specks of gold. But this race for gold is bringing on the destruction of one of the last earthly paradises, the world's largest tropical forest, the lungs of our planet, where everything and anything can be paid in gold. As a result, a gold ingot cycle has developed‚Äîwith its batch of insolvents, prostitutes, godfathers, traffickers, whether in French Guiana, Brazil or Suriname. Gold has brought upon disease, mercury, crime, alcoholism. Gold has turned creeks and rivers into dumping grounds. This cycle is that of the destruction of men by men. Whereas the Amazonian rainforest releases 300 tons of gold each year, it receives 120 tons of mercury. An uneven trade: treasure against poison. And as the backdrop, all sorts of traffics are arising: people, weapons, drugs. In the depths of this borderless jungle also lies the tragedy of the Wayanas, a Native American tribe from Guiana, who are being poisoned by mercury, the element essential to gold mining. The Wayanas are doomed by a looming disappearance. Congenital malformations have already been observed in children. The elderly are developing neurological disorders and cancers. Along with the outrage that is mercury comes another massacre of Indians. The New Eldorado is enduring one of the world's worst globalization disasters.

Dillon's Rolling Western combines elements of 3D exploration, action sequences and tower defense and was first unveiled at E3 2011 as The Rolling Western. On February 14, 2013, Nintendo announced via a Nintendo Direct in North America that the game was to be followed up by a sequel to be released in the following April, entitled Dillon's Rolling Western: The Last Ranger. On September 13, 2017, Nintendo of Japan announced via a Nintendo Direct a new installment for the Nintendo 3DS called . On March 8, 2018 via a Nintendo Direct, the game was revealed to be localized as Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers. The game was released on April 26, 2018 in Japan, and was later released on May 24 in North America and May 25 in Europe. It is the first game in the series to receive a physical release, but only in Japan and Europe. In North America, it remains a Nintendo eShop exclusive, like the previous installments. The game's protagonist, Dillon, is featured in the games Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as an Assist Trophy. Gameplay Dillon, an armadillo, is a ranger charged with protecting villages from nightly invasions of walking rock-like monsters called Grocks. The Grocks attack the villages to feed on Scrogs, the residents' livestock. While Dillon is able to attack Grocks by rolling into them, the Grocks can sometimes outnumber Dillon. Thus, the villages have established defense towers that can be outfitted with weapons that will attack Grocks whenever they are in range. To get guns, Dillon must buy them, and sometimes he may have to build the gun tower first. In order to improve the villages' defenses, Dillon must collect materials by exploring mines and defeating Grocks; the materials can then be used to build stronger doors for the village. The stronger a door is, the more difficult it is for a Grock to get in. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Life  Margaret was the second daughter of the Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg (1413‚Äì1471) from his marriage to Catherine (1421‚Äì1476), daughter of the Elector Frederick I of Saxony. Only two of Frederick's four children survived him: Margaret and her older sister Dorothea. She married on 20 September 1477 in Prenzlau with Duke Bogislaw X of Pomerania (1454‚Äì1523). In 1474, Brandenburg had begun a war against Pomerania, because Bogislaw refused to pay homage to Frederick II. On 1 May 1476, during the peace negotiations, it had been decided that Bogislaw would marry Margaret.Karl Heinrich Ludwig P√∂litz: Handbuch der Geschichte der souverainen Staaten des teutschen Bundes, vol. 1, Weidmann, 1818, p. 146 The marriage was burdensome on Bogislaw. A very low dower had been agreed; even so, it was never paid. A year after the marriage, Bogislaw's uncle Wartislaw X died, making Bogislaw the sole ruler of Pomerania in about 200 years. In 1479, Bogislaw concluded the Peace of Prenzlau with his wife's uncle Albert III Achilles, recognizing the Elector of Brandenburg as his liege lord. Margaret's marriage was childless and her husband accused her of infidelity and disowned her.Peter Treichel: 800 Jahre Pommern und seine Nachbarn, 2009, p. 112 This led to political tensions with the Electorate of Brandenburg. The elector demanded that her dowry be returned. Bogislaw, in turn, alleged that the House of Hohenzollern had given him a barren princess for a wife, so as they would get to inherit Pomerania.F. Voigt: Geschichte des brandenburgisch-preussischen Staates, F. Dummler, 1860, p. 161 During the 1479 peace negotiations, Bogislaw finally signed away his wife's dower.

Biography He graduated from Amherst College in 1824, and spent a year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, studying botany and mineralogy with Thomas Nuttall, and at the same time gave instructed on these topics in Boston. The study of mineralogy led to his preparation of papers on that subject which he sent to the American Journal of Science, and in this manner he became acquainted with Benjamin Silliman, the elder. He was invited in 1827 to become Silliman's assistant, and continued so until 1831. Meanwhile, for a year he was curator of Franklin Hall, an institution that was established by James Brewster in New Haven, Connecticut, for popular lectures on scientific subjects to mechanics. In 1830 he was appointed lecturer on natural history at Yale University, and held that place until 1847. He was associated with Silliman in the scientific examination of the culture and manufacture of sugar that was undertaken by the latter at the special request of the secretary of the treasury; and the southern states, particularly Louisiana and Georgia, were assigned to him to report upon. From 1834 until 1861, he filled the chair of chemistry of the Medical College of South Carolina in Charleston. He relinquished the position at the beginning of the Civil War, but in 1865, upon the urgent invitation of his former colleagues, he resumed his duties for a few years. While in Charleston he discovered rich deposits of phosphate of lime in the immediate vicinity of that city. Their great value in agriculture and subsequent use in the manufacture of superphosphate fertilizers proved an important addition to the chemical industries of South Carolina. In 1845 he was chosen professor of chemistry and natural history in Amherst, which chair was divided in 1852, and he continued to deliver the lectures on natural history until 1877, when he was made professor emeritus. He was associated in 1835 with James G. Percival in the geological survey of Connecticut, and throughout his life he was actively engaged in the study of mineralogy. He announced in 1835 his discovery of his first new species of microlite, that of warwickite in 1838, that of danburite in 1839, and he afterward described many other new minerals until shortly before his death. Shepard acquired a large collection of minerals, which at one time was unsurpassed in this country, and which in 1877 was purchased by Amherst College, but three years later was partially destroyed by fire. Early in life, he began the study and collection of meteorites, and his cabinet, long the largest in the country, likewise became the property of Amherst. His papers on this subject, from 1829 till 1882, were nearly forty in number and appeared chiefly in the American Journal of Science. Shepard received an honorary M.D. degree from Dartmouth College in 1836, and honorary LL.D. from Amherst in 1857. He was a member of many American and foreign societies, including the Imperial Society of Natural Science in St. Petersburg, the Royal Society of G√∂ttingen, and the Society of Natural Sciences in Vienna. Works In addition to his many papers and reports on mines in the United States, he published: *Treatise on Mineralogy (New Haven; 3d ed., enlarged, 1855) *Report on the Geological Survey of Connecticut (1837) Family His son, also named Charles Upham Shepard (born in New Haven, Connecticut, 4 October 1842), was also a chemist. He graduated from Yale in 1863 and at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1867, with the degree of M.D. On his return, he was appointed professor of chemistry in the Medical College of the state of South Carolina, which chair he held until 1883. Afterward, he has devoted himself entirely to the practice of analytical chemistry.

It is in the city of Ennepetal in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The former station building is one of the oldest of its kind in North Rhine- Westphalia and has been listed as a monument since 1986. The station is on the Industrial Heritage Trail. History  With the construction of the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund line by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company in 1848, a station was opened in Milspe, now a suburb of Ennepetal, on 9 March 1849. The station was a timber-framed building. It was called Milspe station until 1954, when it was renamed Ennepetal-Milspe, reflecting the merger of the towns of Milspe and Voerde as Ennepetal 1949. With the closure of Gevelsberg station on the line in 1963, the neighbouring town Gevelsberg no longer had its own station on the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund line. Thus in 1968 Ennepetal-Milspe station was renamed again as Ennepetal (Gevelsberg) station, although it lies entirely within the city of Ennepetal. Services  The station is now served only by Regional-Express services, RE 4 (Wupper-Express), RE 7 (Rhein-M√ºnsterland- Express) and RE 13 (Maas-Wupper-Express). The platform for trains towards Hagen could only be reached at ground level for decades, while the platform for trains towards Wuppertal could only be reached by a subway. In 2010, the existing platform tunnel was rebuilt and extended under the street. Today, there are stairs to the platform and since mid-2011 a lift as well. The central platform has been rebuilt with two new platform edges with a height of 76 cm. This makes the station fully accessible for the disabled for Eurobahn trains, but not for the double-decker trains of DB Regio, with their different floor heights. The wooden platform canopy was preserved and repainted.

Cpg. 67 fol. 77v. Sigenot is an anonymous Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. It is one of the so-called fantastical (aventiurehaft) Dietrich poems, so called because it more closely resembles a courtly romance than a heroic epic. It was likely written in the Alemannic dialect area, no later than 1300. The poem concerns Dietrich's fight with the eponymous giant Sigenot, who defeats Dietrich and takes him prisoner. Dietrich must be rescued by his mentor Hildebrand, who himself is defeated by the giant but manages to escape with the help of the dwarf Eggerich and kill the giant. The Sigenot exists in two principle versions. It was by far the most popular of all Dietrich poems, being transmitted in eight extant manuscripts and twenty-one printings until 1661. It inspired various artistic depictions as well. It is nevertheless not regarded very highly as a work of art and has received little scholarly attention. Summary Sigenot carries Dietrich after defeating him. Cpg 67 fol. 55v The poem exists in two principle versions: the so-called elder Sigenot (√§lterer Sigenot), and the younger Sigenot (j√ºngerer Sigenot) (see \\"Transmission, versions, and dating\\" below). In the √§lterer Sigenot, Dietrich awakens the giant Sigenot in the forest by kicking him. The giant then recognizes Dietrich by the coat of arms on his shield as the slayer of Hilde and Grim, two giant relatives of his, and forces Dietrich to fight him, despite a sudden reluctance (zagheit) on Dietrich's part. Dietrich is thrown into a dungeon. Sigenot now heads to Bern (Verona) to defeat Hildebrand, and, encountering him in the forest, takes him prisoner as well. However, once Hildebrand has been dragged to Dietrich's prison, he is able to free himself, slays the giant and frees Dietrich with the help of the dwarf Duke Eggerich. The two heroes then return to Bern. In the j√ºngerer Sigenot, the poem begins with Hildebrand telling Dietrich about Sigenot. He warns him not to go into the forest to fight the giant. Dietrich ignores this advice and sets out to find Sigenot. Then, before encountering the giant, Dietrich fights a wild man who is keeping the dwarf Baldung captive. As a reward, the dwarf gives Dietrich a protective jewel and directs him to Sigenot. Dietrich fights Sigenot and is taken prisoner. Sigenot throws Dietrich into a snake pit, but the jewel protects him. Sigenot decides to head for Bern. Hildebrand, now worried by Dietrich's long absence, sets out to find him: on the way he encounters Sigenot and is taken prisoner. Left alone in Sigenot's cave, Hildebrand frees himself and dresses in Dietrich's armor. He then slays Sigenot and frees Dietrich with Eggerich's help. Transmission, versions, and dating The Sigenot exists in two overarching versions, the so-called \\"older Sigenot\\" and the \\"younger Sigenot\\" (j√ºngerer Sigenot). Because of the heavy variability between manuscripts in the fantastical Dietrich poems, each individual manuscript can be considered to be a \\"version\\" of these two overarching versions. Formerly, it was believed that the \\"younger Sigenot\\" represented an expansion of the shorter version found in the \\"older Sigenot\\". Now the \\"younger Sigenot is widely believed to be the older version of the two. Given the age of the first manuscript, the poem must have existed before 1300, most likely in the Swabian-Alemannic dialect area. Like almost all German heroic poems, it is anonymous. The \\"older Sigenot is attested in one manuscript: *S1 (L): Badische Landesbibliothek Karlsruhe, Cod. Donaueschingen 74. Parchment, c. 1300, East Alemannic dialect (from Konstanz?). Contains various literary texts, including the Sigenot followed by the Eckenlied. It is likely that this version of 44 stanzas has been deliberately shortened to serve as an introduction or prologue to the Eckenlied, which follows it in the manuscript. The final stanza of the poem includes an explicit mention that the Eckenlied will begin next. The \\"younger Sigenot has around 2000 stanzas, varying by attestation, and is attested in all the remaining manuscripts and printings: *S2 (s, s1): Heldenbuch written by Diebolt von Hanowe. Formerly Strasbourg City/Seminary Library, destroyed 1870. *S3 (hs1): Universit√§tsbibliothek Heidelberg, Cpg 67.

There are also more than 21 printings, with the last being printed in Nuremberg in 1661. Scholarly reception Hildebrand rescues Dietrich from the snake pit. Woodcut from a 1606 printing of Sigenot. Staatsblibliothek Berlin Yf 7808 Although the Sigenot was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich von Bern, it has not been treated kindly by scholars, with both Joachim Heinzle and Victor Millet dismissing it as uninteresting. The poem shows little self-reflexively: Hildebrand stylizes the fight against giants as the chief task of any hero. The text also includes some comical elements, as when Sigenot is able to carry Dietrich under his arm, or when Dietrich's fiery breath, with which he defeated Siegfried in the Rosengarten zu Worms, proves useless against the giant. That Dietrich and Hildebrand together defeat the giant likely shows the solidarity of the noble warriors rather than any suggestion of Dietrich's inadequacy. Metrical form Like the majority of German heroic epics, the Sigenot is written in stanzas. The poem is composed in a stranzaic form known as the \\"Berner Ton,\\" which consists of 13 lines in the following rhyme scheme: aabccbdedefxf. It shares this metrical form with the poems Goldemar, Eckenlied, and Virginal. Early modern melodies for the \\"Berner Ton\\" have survived, indicating that it was meant to be sung. The following stanza from S1 connecting that poem to the Eckenlied can stand in as an example: :Hie mite schieden si von dan a (four feet) :her Dieter√Æch und der w√Æse man, a (four feet) :hin g√™n der stat ze Berne. b (three feet) :d√¢ wurden s√Æ enpfangen wol c (four feet) :mit vr√∂uden, als man herren sol c (four feet) :enpf√¢n und sehen gerne. b (three feet) :sus klagten s√Æ ir ungemach d (four feet) :den rittern und den vrouwen e (three feet) :daz in in dem walde geschach d (four feet) :und wie si muosten schouwen e (three feet) :gr√¥ze n√¥t, von der s√Æ schiet f (four feet) :her Hiltebrant √ªz sorgen. x (three feet) :sus hebet sich ECKEN LIET. f (three feet) Relation to the Oral Tradition Werner Hoffmann describes the entire poem as an invention of the thirteenth century, as there are no attestations for a giant named Sigenot or a dwarf named Eggerich before the poem. However, the poem may connect to Dietrich's captivity among giants, as referenced in the Waldere and found in Virginal: Joachim Heinzle suggests that it was created in the 13th century under the influence of this traditional story. The text also makes reference to Dietrich's battle with Hilde and Grim, which is told in the Thidrekssaga and referenced in the Eckenlied, but about which no poem survives. The story of Hilde and Grim functions as a sort of prequel to Sigenot, showing an attempt to connect the poems together in a cycle. Victor Millet suggests that there may never have been a written poem about Hilde and Grim; the tale may have been a purely oral one and well known to the Sigenot's audience In the Thidrekssaga, Hilde and Grim are said to give their name to Dietrich's helmet, the Hildegrim; George Gillespie argues that they are likely a late addition to the oral tradition in order to explain the meaning of name Hildegrim (meaning battle specter) once this was no longer obvious. Artistic Reception Dietrich fights the wild man before encountering Sigenot (Cod. Pal. germ. 67, fol. 19r). Count Gottfried Werner von Zimmern commissioned a cycle of frescoes in Wildenstein Castle, probably in the 1520s. The frescoes, of which 32 survive in poor condition, were perhaps based on the woodcuts found in the printing of 1520. The late manuscript hs1 (S3), created for Margaret of Savoy has been extensively illuminated, with around 201 miniatures. Nearly every stanza of the poem is accompanied with an illumination. The illuminations are very similar to each other on each page, showing every stage of the poem's narrative, so that one gets the impression of a series of film stills. The illuminations appear to be from the workshop of Ludwig Henfflin. Notes Editions  References    * External links =Facsimiles= *Karlsruhe, Landesbibl., Cod.

History Three hundred years ago, farmers of Ramnad region have traded their crops in the Capital city of Pandya kingdom called Maduraiyampathi. Muthuchettiar is one of the prominent trader and famous for his probity. He used to worship Meenakshi and Chokkanathar on his return to his native. Even though he was rich, he had no children and the family was worried over this. One day while returning from Maduraiyampathi, he found a three-year-old girl baby crying isolated in Chinnamannur. He embraced the child and since there is no one nearby, he felt that God has blessed him with this child and he decided to take care of the child. On his way, he found a river and wished to take bath in it. He left the child on the banks of river and went for bathing. He was shocked to see the child missing on his return. He searched everywhere and unable to find the child. He returned home and explained her wife about the happenings. The couple did not eat out of mental depression and both went on sleep. The child appeared in his dream and informed that it is staying in the cactus forest and asked him to make an idol of it and to worship regularly. As Muthuchettiar carried the child on his shoulders, the child directed to combine his name along with the name of the Goddess, hence the idol of the Goddess was named as \\"Muthumaari\\". People made the idol of Goddess using the sand from the riverside where the child was found and built a thatch-roofed tiny temple. It is believed that people will be provided with all the wealth by worshiping this Goddess. The temple hall was built by collecting donation from the rich people and foreigners. The black stone statue of the Goddess and the temple was built in 1914 . The successors of Muthuchettiar were maintaining the temple for the past seven generations. A successor Mr. N.A.
