Biography  He was taken captive by Cossacks as a young child and later placed in the Moscow Orphanage. Little was ever learned of his origins although, based on some of his early memories, he was believed to be of Kalmyk descent.ArtOnline: Biography of Egorov In 1782, he was enrolled at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he studied with Ivan Akimov and Grigory Ugryumov. He graduated in 1797 and became an academician in 1803, following which he was sent to do field work in Rome and came under the influence of Vincenzo Camuccini, who praised the simplicity of his design and coloring.–ó–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã–µ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏—è–Ω–µ 18-19 –≤–µ–∫–æ–≤. –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è –∏ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—ã (Famous Russians of the 18th and 19th Centuries.

It was rumored that people would buy his paintings for the number of gold coins that could be laid on the principal figure, and that Pope Pius VII had asked him to remain as a court painter, but he politely refused the offer. In 1807, he returned to Saint Petersburg and became an assistant professor at the Academy. He also gave private drawing lessons to Elizabeth AlexeievnaRusArtNet: Biography and Alexander I, who gave him a nickname, \\"The Renowned\\" (–∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–æ–≥–æ), after he completed a fresco with over a hundred figures (\\"World Prosperity\\") at Tsarskoye Selo in only 28 days. As a man of deep faith, he always considered his religious paintings to be his most important work, although he reluctantly produced portraits of many people in the nobility. His wife's father was the sculptor Ivan Martos. As a teacher, he tried to be a friend as well as a mentor and rarely spoke in the curt manner usually associated with instructors at that time. As a father, he refused to give his daughters an education and was very critical of their suitors, kicking one out of the house as a suspected Freemason, simply because of the way he crossed his knife and fork.Maria Kamenskaya, –í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è (Memories): –•—É–¥–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞, (1991) In 1840, he was summarily dismissed by Tsar Nicholas I, who was displeased with images of the Holy Trinity he had painted for Catherine's Cathedral. He was, however, given 1,000 Rubles per year as a pension. Despite becoming disconnected from the Academy, his former students still came to him for guidance, eliciting his opinions of their new works and bringing their students for advice. As a result, he was able to keep busy for the rest of his life. It is reported, however, that he became increasingly stingy, suspicious and generally odd.

Zytronic Displays Limited manufactures laminated optical products from radio frequency interference and electromagnetic interference (RFI/EMI) glass panels, optical displays used on ATMs, to other of electronic displays used in a wide variety of industries. Since July 2000, Zytronic Displays Limited has developed technology relating to the operation of the touch sensors, the lamination techniques and processes, and developed a range of interactive touch sensor products based upon patented projected capacitive technology (PCT). The Group operates from three factories in Tyne and Wear, UK with a representative and distributor network in 39 countries covering Americas, EMEA countries and APAC regions. Technology and applications=Touch Screen Technology Zytronic touch sensor products employ an embedded sensing element and are based on projected capacitive technology.\\"Projected-Capacitive Touch Technology by G. Barrett and R. Omote\\". The PCT sensing mechanism that forms the basis of Zytronic‚Äôs touch sensors consists of a matrix of micro-fine copper capacitors embedded into a durable laminated glass composite. A special feature of this technology is its ability to operate through a thick protective overlay. As a result the touch display can be completely protected from external factors and has a far greater resistance to rough treatment of all forms ‚Äì abrasion, shock, vibration, extreme heat levels, adverse weather conditions and exposure to harmful chemicals in contrast with other traditional touch sensing techniques, such as optical, acoustic, capacitive, infra-red or resistive screens. Optical Filters Optical filters are used to enhance the readability of all types of electronic displays by controlling light transmission, reflection and absorption. The filters can also provide protection of the display from abrasion and damage from impact thereby extending the life of the display, for example tinted or neutral density substrates/interlayers to improve contrast. Customised optical filters enhance electronic display performance and minimise electromagnetic emissions by using micro-fine mesh or transparent conductive coatings for electromagnetic shielding. The conductive coatings are also used for static dissipation. EMI and RFI shielded filters A shielded window is the optimum solution for reducing radio frequency interference (‚ÄúRFI‚Äù) and other electrical/magnetic interference (‚ÄúEMI‚Äù) transmitted through monitors, LCD instrument panels and inspection windows fitted to electronic equipment. Applications Due to the high durability, environmental stability and ability to survive the everyday rigours of outdoor and indoor environments, PCT sensing mechanisms are used in a range of self-service applications such as entertainment and gaming applications, e.g. video jukeboxes, DVD vending machines, drive through restaurant kiosks, ATMs, petrol pumps, medical screens and industrial computers.

It now serves as a residence and also historic house museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to the West Marion Historic District and was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey.Historic American Buildings Survey, #AL-773 (#24), AL-772 (#133), AL-774 (#142). It is featured in Ralph Hammond's Antebellum Mansions of Alabama, Gregory Hatcher's Reverie Mansion and Gardens, and Jennifer Hale's Historic Plantations of Alabama's Black Belt.Hatcher, Gregory, comp. \\"Reverie Mansion and Gardens, Genteel Memories,\\" 2001. History The property on which Reverie sits was sold on February 9, 1858 for $4,000, a large sum in that day, to Joseph Thompson Whitsitt, a planter (according to the census) and railroad investor. Wartime financial reverses led Mr. Whitsitt to sell the mansion on November 28, 1862 for $10,000 to Edward Kenworthy Carlisle, a wealthy cotton broker who also owned one of the finest mansions in Alabama, Kenworthy Hall, located only a few miles away. Carlisle shortly sold the house again on April 28, 1863 to David Scott, a merchant and cotton, grist, and saw mill operator and manufacturer. Scott died on August 9, 1868, and left a will recording the furnishings of the mansion at that time. Harrison H. Hurt, son of a prominent merchant and planter, bought the mansion in 1871 at auction for $4,650. Mr. Hurt's daughter Nellie married Dr. R.C. Hanna and the mansion became known as the Hurt-Hanna House. After Mrs. Hanna's death in 1944, the house was sold to Dr. William T. Weissinger, who in the course of a distinguished career had been General Douglas MacArthur's physician in the army. Mrs. Weissinger first named the house Reverie which it has remained ever since. Since Dr. Weissinger's death in 1971, the house has been owned by a number of families, each of which maintained it as a residence. While the house was owned by David Scott in the 1860s, Union troops occupied the town of Marion and used the house as their headquarters. Some markings of these troops can be found in the attic. Architecture Four white Doric columns of brick, covered with stucco, give this Greek Revival mansion it's monumental appearance. The house features a massive frieze board with dentil moldings which surrounds the entire home. Board siding and double hung paned windows are all original. A cupola or belvedere with classical balustrade sits atop the low-hipped roof and there is also a balcony above the entrance. The mansion is a standard four-room over four-room house with a spacious central hall and grand, unsupported staircase, but also has two story cabinet rooms on the east and west sides. These flanking rooms were unusual at the time and, together with the portico, made the design quite distinctive. Two outbuildings survive: the original kitchen, now connected to the house, and a brick smokehouse. The interior of the Mansion includes elaborate plaster moldings and medallions, original to house, along with inlaid flooring of oak and mahogany which was added later. The ceiling height downstairs is 14' and upstairs 13' with original heart pine floors in most areas. In the garden, a Wisteria arbor is thought to predate the construction of the house by several decades and may be the oldest surviving Wisteria in Alabama. There is also a boxwood parterre (knot garden or maze) which was probably put in sometime after the turn of the 19th century and was restored in recent decades.

It is a contributing property to the Greensboro Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in late March 1936. History Greensboro became increasingly prosperous during the cotton boom of the mid-19th century. In 1850, William Murphy, a lawyer and legislator, sold a prime lot to David F. McCrary, a prominent cotton broker and planter who had originally come from North Carolina and married Elizabeth Cowan Lowry, daughter of a leading Alabama family. McCrary had Murphy's house moved and hired the well known architect B.F. Parsons, originally from Massachusetts, to design a mansion, which was completed in 1858. The Alabama Beacon reported that the house cost $10,000, a very large sum at the time.Alabama Beacon, Greensboro, Alabama, April 24, 1857. Archived at the Alabama Historical Commission. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Mr. McCrary's finances survived the War; he opened the Greensboro Bank and Exchange in 1871. On his death in 1888, the McCrary's only living child, Lelia Jane, and her husband, the noted Presbyterian divine Dr. John M.P. Otts, inherited the property. Otts had given the first sermon to Confederate troops at Fort Sumter. Their son James and his wife Sadie bought the house from his siblings in the 1920s. It remained in the McCrary-Otts family until 1970, when it was sold to Mr. and Mrs. M.D. Baines. The house was sold again in 2011. Architecture A detailed, twelve-page building contract for Magnolia Hall was discovered by Dr. David Nelson, a McCrary descendant.Letter from Dr. David Nelson to M.D. and Elizabeth Baines, July 23, 1982.Copy of contract in possession of Dr. Nelson and also at Magnolia Hall. Few such contracts describing the construction of antebellum mansions have survived. This one calls for porticoes, north and south, each with six fluted columns, of the \\"Grecian Ionic Order...the Entablature and Mouldings all to harmonize with it...and proportioned after the order.\\" In addition it calls for double balconies of delicate iron grill work, and colored glass transoms around the doors. Inside are large four-over-four rooms, 14-foot ceilings, chandelier medallions, and a grand, mahogany-railed staircase in the spacious hallway. W. E. Yerby, in his History of Greensboro, concluded that Magnolia Hall \\"is indisputably one of the finest antebellum mansions in Alabama...[and] a perfect example of late Greek Revival architecture.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * External linksExternal links * Category:Houses completed in 1855 Category:Greek Revival houses in Alabama Category:Houses in Hale County, Alabama Category:Historic district contributing properties in Alabama Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alabama Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hale County, Alabama Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama ","title":"Magnolia Hall (Greensboro, Alabama)"},{"id":"33745699","text":"Rubicon Minerals is a Canadian company active in gold exploration. Rubicon owns more than of exploration ground near Red Lake, Ontario, Canada, and has made significant discoveries of gold on this property. The property is near to Goldcorp's Red Lake Mine. As of August 2018 the company had a market capitalization of $80 million. Early years In the late 1980s Rubicon explored what is now the McFinely property in the Red Lake area, finding gold along a historically gold-producing trend about in length. Rubicon Minerals' stock began trading on the TSX Venture Exchange in November 1997. In September 1999 Rubicon announced encouraging assay results from a large sulphide discovery on the Palmer project near Haines, Alaska. The company acquired the McFinely property in 2001 following several years of litigation and began drilling in November 2002. Drilling on the water-based part would be carried out in winter when the lakes were frozen. In September 2003 Rubicon graduated to trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and was delisted from the Venture Exchange. In September 2004 Rubicon was listed on the American Stock Exchange. Africa and Newfoundland In February 2004, Rubicon made a partnership agreement with IAMGold Corporation through which IAMGold would invest in exploratory drilling at Rubicon's Avalon gold project in Newfoundland in exchange for a 55% interest. In February 2006, Africo Resources, which was 38.8% owned by Rubicon, released results from drill holes at its Kalukundi copper and cobalt deposit in Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The inferred resource was now 12.15 million tonnes of ore grading 2.45% copper and 0.61% cobalt. Later that year Rubicon spun off Africo and Rubicon's Newfoundland assets into two separate companies. The Newfoundland gold and base metal assets were held by Paragon Minerals Corporation. Shortly after the spin-off was completed in December 2006 Rubicon's share prices dropped by 10%. Red Lake development The headframe at Rubicon Minerals Phoenix Gold Project in Red Lake, Ontario In February 2006 Rob McEwen, the former chairman and CEO of Goldcorp, said he was investing C$10 million in Rubicon, and was also selling of land near the Pogo gold mine in Alaska to Rubicon in exchange for additional shares. McEwen was to become a strategic advisor to the company. Shares rose by almost 40% when the news was released. In May 2007 McEwen announced that he owned or controlled about 32.8% of Rubicon's current outstanding common shares. In December 2009, Rubicon Minerals was added to the Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark S&P;/TSX Composite Index. At this time, in addition to the Red Lake property the company owned more than around the Pogo Mine in Alaska, and in northeast Nevada. McEwen's share was now 21.5%. In November 2010 Rubicon Minerals shares shot up after the company announced that part of their Phoenix project in the Red Lake area had an estimated inferred resource of 4 million ounces of gold. Drilling results indicated a grade of gold per ton of ore. In July 2011 Agnico-Eagle Mines made a CDN$70 million investment through non-brokered private placement of common shares. Rubicon continued to develop the Phoenix gold project, and in October 2011 announced that it now had a grid power connection from Hydro One, replacing the former diesel generators. Rubicon reduced its gold reserves by 88% on January 11, 2016. In December 2016 Rubicon announced it had completed a restructuring transaction and shares in the stock would resume trading.

It commonly occurs in flocks of domestic hens reared for egg production, although it can also occur in domestic turkeys, pheasants and other poultry species. Poultry create a social order of dominance known as pecking order. When pressure occurs within the flock, pecking can increase in aggression and escalate to cannibalism. Cannibalism can occur as a consequence of feather pecking which has caused denuded areas and bleeding on a bird's skin.Savory, J., (2010). Nutrition, feeding and drinking behaviour, and welfare. In The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds, I.J.H. Duncan and P. Hawkins (Eds). Springer. pp. 165-188 Cannibalism can cause large mortality rates within the flock and large decreases in production due to the stress it causes. Vent pecking, sometimes called 'cloacal cannibalism', is considered to be a separate form of cannibalistic pecking as this occurs in well-feathered birds and only the cloaca is targeted.Savory, C.J., (1995). Feather pecking and cannibalism. World's Poultry Science Journal, 51: 215‚Äì219Rodenburg, T.B., Komen, H., Ellen, E.D., Uitdehaag, K.A., and van Arendonk, J.A.M., (2008). Selection method and early-life history affect behavioural development, feather pecking and cannibalism in laying hens: A review. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 110: 217-228 There are several causes that can lead to cannibalism such as: light and overheating, crowd size, nutrition, injury/death, genetics and learned behaviour. Research has been conducted to attempt to understand why poultry engage in this behaviour, as it is not totally understood. There are known methods of control to reduce cannibalism such as crowd size control, beak trimming, light manipulation, perches, selective genetics and eyewear. Motivational basis Poultry species which exhibit cannibalism are omnivores. For example, hens in the wild often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even larger animals such as lizards or young mice, although they are mainly herbivorous in adulthood. Feather pecking is often the initial cause of an injury which then attracts the cannibalistic pecking of other birds ‚Äì perhaps as re-directed foraging or feeding behaviour. In the close confines of modern farming systems, the increased pecking attention is easily observed by multiple birds which join in the attack, and often the escape attempts of the cannibalised bird attract more pecking attention.  Causes  Poultry in captivity is where most cannibalistic behaviours are observed. Due to this, there are many factors that can cause cannibalism. Some of these factors are outline below:  Light and overheating  High intensity light with prolonged exposure can lead to cannibalism of poultry in captivity due to the increase of stress and overheating that causes discomfort.  Crowd size  Poultry have a social hierarchy and when crowds are too close together, dominant birds will fight more often to obtain or sustain dominance which can increase risk of cannibalism. The increase crowd size also plays into a few more factors. With larger crowd there is less space in the pen. This allows for less feeding space which therefore means that dominant birds will take majority of the food supply leaving less dominant birds susceptible to becoming underweight and easier targets to the dominant birds for cannibalism. An optimal flock size are either large flock of greater than 30 where the group is too large to recognize an established dominant bird and the social hierarchy breaks down, or a small group size where a social order can easily organize itself. Intermediate group sizes cause confusion among the flock and leads to higher aggression of different birds attempting to become the dominant one and therefore leading to increased risk of cannibalism.  Nutrition  A particular diet of low protein but high energy is shown to lead to less aggressive behaviours, but in saying that, a diet lacking the protein methionine is shown to cause aggressive behaviours. Methionine is an essential amino acid. This means the body cannot produce the amino acid and needs an external source to obtain its required amount. Oftentimes in flocks it is the first limiting bj mino acids. One reason as to why methionine could lead to aggressive behaviour is because it Methionine contains sulfur. This sulfur is oftentimes used by the bird to make feathers. When this amino acid is deficient poultry will pecking and feather eat other birds to receive their required amounts. This behavior could then escalate to turning into cannibalism. Poultry have a gland called the preen gland that secrets an oily salty tasting substances. When their diets lack salt, the gland produces the oily substances but without the salty taste. The bird then believes it is not getting its requirement from the gland and will peck at other birds preen gland to meet their requirements. When the behaviour of pecking other birds is introduced, it can lead to increased risk of cannibalism. When feeding, it is important to give enough space and to lay the feed to mimic the environmental conditions and spread the feed so poultry spend time pecking at the food and not each other. Feather eating is another potential cause to cannibalism. Feather eating a behaviour similar to feather pecking where poultry will peck at other members of the flock to eat their feathers. In a study of F2 cross of hens for aggressive pecking behaviour it was seen that feather eating during a chicks rearing stage of life meant it had a higher likelihood of feather pecking in the laying stage of its life. One reason they believed why feather eating was prevalent is that keratin from feathers was not uses a nutritional source per se, but could enhance the gut microbiome.  Injury or death  Within a pen, if another bird is injured or dead, the sight of this can encourage other pen members to engage in cannibalistic behaviours. This is due to the social order created by poultry, as well as their attraction to blood. Poultry are attracted to the colour red and the sight of blood can cause them to be attracted to the injured bird and peck at it more to increase their rank in the pecking order. Sometimes this even leads to their death. Prevalence Cannibalism among layer hen flocks is highly variable; when it is not problematic, mortalities among production systems are generally similar. Published data on the prevalence of cannibalism could be misleading due to the inclusion of vent-pecking by some researchers but not others. Mortalities, due mainly to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg-laying flocks housed in aviaries,Hill, J.A. (1986). Egg production in alternative systems - a review of recent research in the UK. Research and Development in Agriculture, 3: 13-18 straw yards,Gibson, S.W., Dun, P. and Hughes, B.O., (1988). The performance and behaviour of laying fowls in a covered strawyard system. Research and Development in Agriculture, 5: 153-163 and free-range systems.Keeling, L.J., Hughes, B.O. and Dun, P., (1988). Performance of free range laying hens in a polythene house and their behaviour on range. Farm Building Progress, 94: 21-28 Because egg-laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in cage systems, cannibalism is reduced,Appleby, M.C. and Hughes, B.O., (1991). Welfare of laying hens in cages and alternative systems: Environmental, physical and behavioural aspects. World's Poultry Science Journal, 47:109-128 leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems. In a study which examined 'skin damage' (most of which would have been caused by pecking) on hens at the end of their productive lives, damage was lowest in hens from free range systems, followed by barns, then furnished cages, and highest in conventional or battery cages.Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J. and Nicol, C.J., (2010). Comparison of the welfare of layer hens in 4 housing systems in the UK. British Poultry Science, 51: 488-499 Methods of control=Beak-trimming Beak-trimming is the most common method of preventing or reducing injuries by cannibalism. In a three-year study of floor-housed laying hens, death by cannibalism was reported as 7% in beak-trimmed birds but was increased to 18% in non-trimmed birds.Flock, D.K., Laughlin K.F. and Bentley, J., (2005). Minimizing losses in poultry breeding and production: how breeding companies contribute to poultry welfare. World's Poultry Science Journal, 61: 227‚Äì237This method can be consider cruel as it can cause acute and chronic pain to the bird. The beaks of poultry are highly sensitive to touch, heat and pressure. Trimming their beaks loses their ability to sense the external world and could causes neuromas which are bundles of severe nerve endings that became exposed due to beak trimming. Group size Increased group sizes in larger cages or floor systems can elevate the risk of cannibalism and feather pecking, probably due to the spread of the behaviour through social learning.Lay Jr., D.C., Fulton, R.M., Hester, P.Y., Karcher, D.M., Kjaer, J.B., Mench, J.A., Mullens, B.A., Newberry, R.C., C.J., O'Sullivan, N.P. and Porter, R.E., (2011). Hen welfare in different housing systems. Poultry Science, 90: 278-294 Light manipulations Lights are sometimes provided in nest-boxes to attract hens to use the nests, but this practice has been correlated with an increased risk of cannibalism.Zimmerman, P.H., Lindberg, A.C., Pope, S.J., Glen, E., Bolhuis, J.E. and Nicol, C.J., (2006). The effect of stocking density, flock size and modified management on laying hen behaviour and welfare in a non-cage system. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 101: 111‚Äì124 Perches Rearing chicks with access to perches by four weeks of age has been associated with increased use of perches, and reduced cannibalism, in adulthood.Gunnarsson, S., Keeling, L.J. and Svedberg, J., (1999). Effects of rearing factors on the prevalence of floor eggs, cloacal cannibalism and feather pecking in commercial flocks of loose housed laying hens. British Poultry Science, 40: 12‚Äì18 Selective breeding and genetics A sibling-selection programme has genetically selected a low mortality line which shows decreased mortality from cannibalism compared to a control line.Nordquist, R.E., Heerkens, J.L.T., Rodenburg, T.B., Boks, S., Ellen, E.D. and van der Staay, F.J., (2011). Laying hens selected for low mortality: Behaviour in tests of fearfulness, anxiety and cognition. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 131: 110-122 Eyewear Cannibalism may be reduced by fitting hens with a range of eyewear. Rose-tinted glasses or contact lenses have been used. Opaque spectacles, or blinders, have also been used. For both spectacles and blinders, there are versions held in place by circlips in the nares of the bird, or others in which a pin pierces the nasal septum. The piercing method is illegal in the UK. It is theorized that ‚Äî as with placing red filters over windows, or keeping the birds in red light ‚Äî the coloured lenses prevent the birds from recognising the blood or raw flesh of other hens, thereby diminishing cannibalistic behaviour.  Nature vs. Nurture  While cannibalism of poultry is a learned behaviour, there is a genetic component that can make the bird be more susceptible to engaging or initiating cannibalism.  Nature  Pecking and other forms of pecking (feather pecking, vent packing, aggressive pecking) are normal behaviours that have genetic influences One study in the Netherlands tested if a specific farming style had an effect on cannibalism. During the study they estimated the heredity of feather pecking to be as high as 0.56 Another study found that brown-egg laying hens are more likely to engage in feather pecking then white- egg laying hens. The genetics of poultry will not guarantee a bird will engage in cannibalism, but the genes a bird possesses play a part in the degree of aggressiveness a bird could engage in feather pecking and increases their risk engaging in cannibalism. Certain genetic technologies such as linkage analysis could identify genes related to feather pecking and could be screen against to select birds that are less likely to engage in pecking. However, one study found a correlation between feather pecking and egg production and found that birds that engage in high feather pecking behaviour, had on average had a higher egg production. Therefore, selecting against feather pecking could reduce egg production. Farmers would have to choose between a trade off of either possibly having higher egg production with a high potential of flock death due to cannibalism, versus lower egg production with a lower risk of death due to cannibalism.  Nurture  As mentioned before, pecking and feather pecking are normal behaviours, but cannibalism can be learned. Feather eating is also a normal behaviour that can lead the bird into engaging in feather pecking. As a chick during rearing engages in feather eating, there are more likely to engage in feather pecking during the \\"laying' stage of their lives. Furthermore, if a member of the flock has been feather pecked on, they will stay in this category as the damage to the feathers are a physical indicator to others that that bird is being targeted. One study found that fear could increase feather pecking and primary cannibals can influence secondary cannibals by initiating cannibalism by becoming more aggressive in pecking. Cannibalism within a flock is seen as a chain reaction where if one member of the flock begins, if left unattended, will cause others around it to learn the behaviour and engage in cannibalism. The social order of a flock will also play into the risk of cannibalism. This can be seen if a primary cannibal is a higher ranked bird in the flock, it could influence more secondary cannibals and spread this behaviour more rapidly.  Genotype- environmental interaction  While genetics and learned experience can influence behaviour, ultimately it is an interaction of the two that gives the expressed behaviour. The Netherland study found the flocks of the same breed had different outcomes of whether cannibalism developed or not depending of the management control of the different farms the flocks grew up in. While the genetics of these flocks were similar, the environmental factors ultimately influences the introduction of cannibalism in the flocks. In some flocks 36.4% of the deaths due to cannibalism was observed. To minimize cannibalism in domesticated poultry different approaches such as ecology, environmental physiology, epidemiology, molecular genetics and ethology. But the approach with the most success was the molecular genetic with behavioural research and could lead to the decline of server practices to reduce cannibalism such as beak trimming.

History of the development of the policy The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare assembled a Committee in 1996 for the purpose of preparing a health policy, with members drawn from civil society and professional bodies, including technocrats and bureaucrats. A further five sub-committees were formed to: * Evaluate the existing health services and determining the goals * Formulate policies to ensure essential services * Formulate policies to ensure hospital- based services * Design Strategies for HRD * Integrate NGOs and the Private Sector and plan for resources and utilisation of funds The sub-committees worked for more than a year and submitted their efforts/recommendations. A working group was formed and entrusted with the responsibilities for compiling the recommendations contained in the reports. The working group also organised workshops in all six Divisions to elicit opinions of cross-section of the society on these reports. Finally the working group presented the proposals and recommendations to the National Health Policy Formulation Committee. A report on the health policy was thus formulated on the basis of consensus. The Cabinet on 14 Aug 2000 approved the National Health Policy. Health care system The health care are designated to meet the health needs of the community through the use of available knowledge and resources. The services provided should be comprehensive and community based. The resources must be distributed according to the needs of the community. The final outcome of good health care system is the changed health status or improve health status of the community which is expressed in terms of lives saved, death averted, disease prevented, disease treated, prolongation of life etc. Health care delivery system in Bangladesh based on PHC concept has got various Level of service delivery: * Home and community level. * Union level, * Union sub centre (USC) or Health and family welfare centre; This is the first health facility level. * Thana level, Thana Health Complex (THC): This is the first referral level. * District Hospital: This is the secondary referral level. * National Level: This is the tertiary referral level. A) Primary level health care is delivered though USC or HFWC with one in each union domiciliary level, integrated health and family planning services through field workers for every 3000‚Äì4000 population and 31 bed capacities in hospitals. B) The secondary level health care is provided through 500 bed capacities in district hospital. Facilities provide specialist services in internal medicine, general surgery, gynecology, paediatrics and obstetrics, eye clinical, pathology, blood transfusion and public health laboratories. C) Tertiary Level health care is available at the medical college hospital, public health and medical institutes and other specialist hospitals at the national level where a mass wide range of specialised as well as better laboratory facilities are available. The referral system will be developed keeping in view the following. 1\\\\. A clearly spent-out linkage between the specialised national institutes, medical college and district hospitals to ensure proper care and treatment of patients from the rural areas served by lower level facilities. 2\\\\. Patients from the rural areas referred by lower level facilities to district and medical college hospitals and specialised institutions should get preferential treatment after admission See also * Health in Bangladesh * Blood donation in Bangladesh * HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh * Water supply and sanitation in Bangladesh References Category:Health in Bangladesh Category:Health policy ","title":"Health policy in Bangladesh"},{"id":"33745824","text":"Will Allison is an American novelist and editor.

The castle was then the caput of the Cockburns of Langton until 1745. From 1389 to 1396, Sir Alexander Cockburn of Langton was the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In a dispute over succession to the estate, the castle was besieged by William Cockburn and his brother in law, David Home of Wedderburn in 1517. Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie, the French deputy for Regent Albany, summoned Cockburn and Home to resolve the dispute. They in turn broke off the siege and ambushed Bastie near Preston, there they slew him and displayed his head at the Mercat cross of Duns. Mary, Queen of Scots visited the castle in 1566. David Gavin of Gavinton and his first wife, Christine (Edward Haytley) In 1745, Cockburn of Langton was killed at the Battle of Fontenoy and the estate was bought by a Mr David Gavin in 1758, whereafter the castle and the village of Langton were demolished to make way for a new mansion house.

NASA Watch NASA Watch is a website blog which provides insider information and commentary about the United States space program and the U.S. government agency, NASA. The first posting was in March, 1996. Cowing is a strong supporter of human spaceflight. Cowing started the website when Daniel Goldin was administrator of NASA and at that time expressed harsh criticism of Goldin's policies. The inciting event for Keith was the mass layoffs in the transition from Space Station Freedom to the International Space Station. For several years, NASA refused to accredit Cowing as a journalist and denied him access to NASA media events. Cowing was eventually granted full press accreditation. Cowing was a firm supporter of Goldin's successor as administrator, Sean O'Keefe, appointed by George W. Bush. Cowing also obtained exclusive first-hand information about the genesis of the Vision for Space Exploration, detailed in the book New Moon Rising which Cowing wrote with Frank Sietzen. When Michael Griffin was NASA administrator, the relationship between NASA Watch and NASA seemed to have been a more confrontational one. Cowing, as well as other space program insiders, commented negatively about a return to Goldin-style management practices under Griffin. Cowing dubbed Monday, June 13, 2005 as Black Monday when many NASA personnel were sent reassignment letters.

Raju, who was in Germany to do space research, was not informed of his mother's demise and has a nervous breakdown when he gets the news. He takes a couple of years to recover. After that he marries his childhood sweetheart Ashwathy (Rima Kallingal). She is the daughter of their former family chauffeur and the marriage took place much against her mother's wishes. Ashwathy barely has an idea as to what lies in store as Raju has had a history of mental unsteadiness. She has heard about his illness, that he has been mentally disturbed after his mother's death but now, she has to face the situation with virtually no support. Raju lives in a world of his own, away from all the business deals and money, unlike his elder brother Vishwan (Jishnu). But his near and dear ones look at every action of his through the prism of his past illness, which frustrates him. It does not help that he has a rather short temper. To add to the oddities, he has converted his bedroom into a space research lab and dreams of building an organically self- sustainable world for himself and his wife in the middle of the family's rubber estate.

Meaning for people Industrial sickness is an term applied to various things associated with industry that make people ill and cause them to miss work. The solutions will have to be tailored to the specific industry, and only in that way can any real effect be made on improving the health and productivity of the industrial workforce. The key is an aggressive work-up on the health issues for a given segment of the industrial workforce, and usually broken down by type of work (which makes sense). Even as coal miners face overpowering respiratory threats, and foundry and mill workers have to confront major physical threats from large (heavy) quantities of extremely hot materials, each facet of industrial production has its hot-button health issues. Industrial health managers need training and experience identifying and remediating conditions that present major health threats to their respective workforces. Then they can train the rest of management and can teach the workers themselves about the best way to carry out their jobs with minimum threats to their health. Meaning for companies According to Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002 \\"'Sick Industrial Company' means an industrial company which has i) The Accumulated losses in any financial year equal to 50 per cent or more of its average net worth during four years immediately preceding such financial year; or ii) Failed to repay its debts within any three consecutive quarters on demand made in writing for its repayment by a creditor or creditors of such company.\\" Industrial Sickness In India Industrial sickness specially in small-scale Industry has been always a demerit for the Indian economy, because more and more industries like ‚Äì cotton, Jute, Sugar, Textiles small steel and engineering industries are being affected by this sickness problem. As per an estimate 300 units in the medium and large scale sector were either closed or were on the stage of closing in the year 1976. About 10% of 4 lakhs unit were also reported to be ailing. And this position also remain same in the next decades. At the end of year 1986, the member of sick units in the portfolio of scheduled commercial banks stood at 1,47,740 involving an out standing bank credit of Rs. 4874 crores. * Where the total number of large Industries which are sick were 637 units at the end of year 1985 increased to 714 units in the end of next year 1986. * Likewise on the other hand the number of sick small scale units were also increased 1.18 lakhs at the end of 1985 to 1.46 lakhs at the end of 1986. * The bank amount which was outstanding in case of large industries for the same period also increased from Rs.2,900 crores to Rs. 3287 crores at the end of year 1986 * Dues of Small Scale sector also increased from Rs.1071 crores to Rs.1306 crores at the end of the year 1986. * Of the 147, 740 sick industrial units which contains large medium as well as small scale involving the total bank loan (credit) of Rs. 4874 at the end of the year 1986. Causes of sickness in small scale industry The different types of industrial sickness in Small Scale Industry (SSI) fall under two important categories. They are as follows: Internal causes for sickness We can say pertaining to the factors which are within the control of management. This sickness arises due to internal disorder in the areas justified as following: a) Lack of Finance: This including weak equity base, poor utilization of assets, inefficient working capital management, absence of costing & pricing, absence of planning and budgeting and inappropriate utilization or diversion of funds. b) Bad Production Policies : Another very important reason for sickness is wrong selection of site which is related to production, inappropriate plant & machinery, bad maintenance of Plant & Machinery, lack of quality control, lack of standard research & development and so on. c) Marketing and Sickness : This is another part which always affects the health of any sector as well as SSI. This including wrong demand forecasting, selection of inappropriate product mix, absence of product planning, wrong market research methods, and bad sales promotions. d) Inappropriate Personnel Management: Another internal reason for the sickness of SSIs is inappropriate personnel management policies which includes bad wages and salary administration, bad labour relations, lack of behavioural approach causes dissatisfaction among the employees and workers. e) Ineffective Corporate Management: Another reason for the sickness of SSIs is ineffective or bad corporate management which includes improper corporate planning, lack of integrity in top management, lack of coordination and control etc. External causes for sickness a) Personnel Constraint: The first for most important reason for the sickness of small scale industries are non availability of skilled labour or manpower wages disparity in similar industry and general labour invested in the area. b) Marketing Constraints: The second cause for the sickness is related to marketing. The sickness arrives due to liberal licensing policies, restrain of purchase by bulk purchasers, changes in global marketing scenario, excessive tax policies by govt. and market recession. c) Production Constraints: This is another reason for the sickness which comes under external cause of sickness. This arises due to shortage of raw material, shortage of power, fuel and high prices, import- export restrictions. d) Finance Constraints: Another external cause for the sickness of SSIs is lack of finance. This arises due to credit restrains policy, delay in disbursement of loan by govt., unfavorable investments, fear of nationalization. e)credit squeeze initiated by the government policies.

POGO's goal is to promote global operational oceanography, the implementation of a Global Ocean Observing System, and the importance of ocean observations for society. In 2011, POGO had 40 Members. The current Chairman (2011-2012) is Prof. Nick Owens (Scottish Association for Marine Science, UK). It is supported from annual dues subscribed by the Members, as well as by grants from charitable foundations. The funds to explore the value of, and then establish, POGO were provided by the Alfred P. Sloan and Richard Lounsbery foundations. POGO provides a forum (at the annual meetings and intersessionally) for Members to meet with their peers, and with senior officials of partner organisations, to discuss issues of mutual concern. As a means to ease the shortage in trained observers of the ocean in developing countries, It has developed a suite of programmes in capacity building, and works with relevant partner organisations in the marine field SCOR, IOC, GOOS, GEO). It engages in outreach activities to the general public, for example by having exhibits at international events such as World Expo (2012), UNFCCC COP Meetings and AGU-ASLO-TOS Ocean Sciences Meetings Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea.Seeyave, S. and Platt, T. \\"POGO -Joining Forces to Observe the Ocean for Science and Society\\", Marine Scientist, 38, pp. 8-11, Institute of Marine Engineering Science and Technology (IMarEST), February 2012. History In March 1999, the Directors of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the Southampton Oceanography Centre in the UK, convened a planning meeting in the headquarters of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation (IOC-UNESCO) in Paris. This meeting confirmed the value of creating a new partnership and defined the initial mission statement and terms of reference. Scripps Institution of Oceanography hosted the first formal meeting in early December 1999, which included senior officials from 17 institutions in 12 countries (as well as representatives of the IOC, the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR) of the International Council for Science (ICSU), the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and several international scientific programs. At this meeting, there was agreement on an initial work plan, including development of an advocacy plan for observing systems; participation in processes to secure governmental commitments to fund ocean observing systems; a data interchange demonstration pilot project; and establishment of a clearinghouse for information exchange among POGO members, as well as the broader community. POGO Capacity Building * The Nippon Foundation - POGO Centre of Excellence in Observational Oceanography (currently hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Science), under which ten scientists from developing countries, annually, are supported to study for ten months in an intensive programme related to ocean observations. By 2012, 40 young scientists have been trained. * The POGO-SCOR Visiting Fellowship Programme, for scientists from developing countries to spend up to three months in a major oceanographic institution. POGO awards about a dozen of these each year. By 2011, 125 young scientists in all. The programme is carried out in conjunction with POGO's sister organisation SCOR. * The POGO- AMT Fellowship Programme, under which one scientist annually participate sin a major oceanographic cruise (the Atlantic Meridional Transect cruise), and spend time at a participating major oceanographic institute before and after the cruise to experience cruise preparation and data analysis. (2008+). Under POGO capacity-building schemes, some 1000 young scientists from 63 countries have received advanced training. Former scholars or alumni of NF-POGO training become members of the rapidly developing NF-POGO Alumni Network for Oceans (NANO). Activities In its S√£o Paulo Declaration of 2001, POGO drew attention to the world imbalance between Northern and Southern Hemispheres in the capacity to observe the oceans, resulting in its establishment of a capacity-building programme (above). It also underlined the relative paucity of ocean observations in the Southern Hemisphere compared with the Northern Hemisphere, and POGO member JAMSTEC, organised a circumnavigation of the Southern Hemisphere, the BEAGLE Expedition, using its ship RV Mirai, at a cost estimated to be around $35M. More recently, selected Antarctic Expeditions of the Alfred Wegener Institute have been labelled POGO Expeditions. POGO also supports the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). Around the time POGO was being started, the Argo programme was also beginning. The GEO Secretariat was established during the early years of POGO. Oceans did not appear among the nine societal-benefit areas around which GEO was structured at that time. POGO advocated for a greater prominence of ocean observing activities within GEO, which led the creation of a new Ocean Task (SB01, Oceans and Society: Blue Planet) in the 2012-2015 GEO Work Plan. This was expanded and further developed into what is now known as the GEO Blue Planet Initiative. POGO contributed to OceanObs'09 in Venice in 2009, which led to the opening up of sustained ocean observations to a broader community, including chemical, biological and biogeochemical observations, and also participated in the post- Venice Framework for Ocean Observing Committee. More recently, POGO was involved in the OceanObs'19 conference in Honolulu, USA. POGO member institutions have been driving the establishment of OceanSites (coordinated, deep-ocean, multi-disciplinary time-series reference sites), which has made significant progress in recent years. The idea for an \\"International Quiet Ocean Experiment\\" first came up during one of the POGO Annual Meetings. With seed funding from the Sloan Foundation, the idea was further developed in partnership with SCOR. An Open Science Meeting was convened under the auspices of SCOR and POGO at IOC-UNESCO, Paris, in August‚ÄìSeptember 2011, to develop a Science Plan for the project, which could last up to ten years.Valo, Martine. \\"Un plan pour evaluer le bruit dans le monde du silence\\", Le Monde, 3 September 2011.

Life Jacob van Hulsdonck was born in Antwerp in 1582.Jacob van Hulsdonck in the RKD He moved to Middelburg at a young age and there he likely received at least part of his training. The prime still life painting studio in Middelburg was that of Flemish √©migr√© Ambrosius Bosschaert. Although it is believed van Hulsdonck did not train with Bosschaert he may have been an early influence on his work.Jacob van Hulsdonck (Antwerp 1582-1647), Apricots, plums and grapes in a bowl and strewn on a ledge, with a vase of flowers at Christie's Still life of tulips, carnations, a rose and other flowers By 1608 van Hulsdonck had returned to Antwerp as is documented by the record of his admission as a master of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke that year.Jacob van Hulsdonck (1582‚Äì1647), A still life of tulips, roses, bluebells, daffodils, a peony and other flowers in a glass roemer on a wooden ledge with a dragonfly at Sotheby‚Äôs The following year he married Maria la Hoes and moved into the house that remained his residence for the rest of his life.Fred G Meijer, Jacob van Hulsdonck, Still life on a plain table of a Wanli period dish filled with raisins, dried figs and almonds, with bread, slices of sugared preserved melon, raisins and almonds strewn on the table, with a bluebottle on the melon at Richard Green The couple had seven children.Sam Segal, Nabio Bijutsukan, T≈çky≈ç Sutƒìshon Gyararƒ´, Art Gallery of New South Wales SDU Publishers, Flowers and nature: Netherlandish flower painting of four centuries, SDU Publishers, 1990 Jacob van Hulsdonck was the teacher of his son Gillis who later worked for a long period as a still life painter in Amsterdam. Work=General Jacob van Hulsdonck was a still life painter of banquet style pieces, fruit bowls and flowers. Roughly 100 paintings are currently attributed to him. The meticulous handling of detail in his work likely explains his relatively low output. More than half of his paintings are signed with his characteristic full signature in capitals while some are signed with a monogram only. Still life with fruit in a Wanli bowl on a table with a butterfly and a scarab beetle Because he only left one dated work, the Breakfast piece with a fish, ham and cherries of 1614 (Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle) it is difficult to establish a chronology of his works. Panel makers' marks are of little help in dating his work because of his preference for panels prepared with gesso on the reverse, which makes the wood more stable and less susceptible to warping. It is believed that his earliest still lifes are the ones in which the edge of the table is close to the bottom of the picture and the table is depicted from a rather elevated viewpoint. In these early works, the table is partly covered with a white cloth. In his later works he abandoned some of the rigidity of these early works by lowering the viewpoint, leaving some space under the table and including one side of the table in the composition. His palette is also believed to have evolved over the years and his later works have brighter colours and less dark backgrounds. His later still lifes are set out on plain wooden tables. The grain of the wood is typically depicted in great detail. Occasionally these tables are partly covered with a dark (greyish- or greenish-black) cloth. Although he must have been familiar with the work of the Bosschaert studio, his work shows more affinity with the work of Osias Beert and even Hieronymous Francken II, two still life artists active in early 17th century Antwerp. It is even possible that van Hulsdonck worked in their circle before becoming a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in 1608. His flower pieces show the influence of Jan Brueghel the Elder. Whereas 17th-century still lifes are usually believed to convey a hidden ‚Äòmessage‚Äô, often related to the vanitas motif of the transience of all things, in van Hulsdonck‚Äôs works this seems to have been largely absent. Van Hulsdonck did, however, often include a bluebottle as an eye-catching motif and the only living creature in his still lifes. Flies are often regarded as a symbol of the shortness of life. Breakfast piece with a fish, ham and cherries Banquet pieces and fruit bowls The banquet pieces of van Hulsdonck typically depict one bowl or basket of fruit in the center. There are six examples where he placed a small vase of flowers to one side of the bowl. The fruits are usual freshly picked plums, grapes, apricots or strawberries, although there is an example of a painting, the Still life with raisins, apricots and plums in a porcelain dish, which depicts dried fruit and nuts. Van Hulsdonck was particularly skilled in rendering the softness and delicacy of the skins of the fruit. He was a master in bringing out the difference of texture and colouring of the various types of fruit and their foliage. Flower pieces Van Hulsdonck also painted pure flower still lifes although they account for a much smaller portion of his oeuvre. Only a few of these are signed and have therefore sometimes been attributed to other artists. For instance, the work Still life of tulips, carnations, a rose and other flowers in a glass beaker resting on a wooded ledge (sold at Sotheby's on 3 July 2013 in London, lot 23) was previously attributed to Jan van Kessel the Elder. His flower pieces can be regarded as a precursor of van Kessel‚Äôs work as well as that of Daniel Seghers. Still life with raisins, apricots and plums in a porcelain dish A few of his flower pieces only depict a single variety of flowers such as carnations, but most of the time he painted a mixture of a restricted number of blooms in which tulips dominate. The flowers are typically set against a dark background and are held in simple clear glass beakers with prunts in the lower register only, in order to allow the stems of each flower to be followed through to the base. His flower pieces show a greater formal elegance and refined simplicity than Brueghel's usually more elaborate flower pieces. This may possibly be due to Bosschaert's formative influence.

History Materialise was founded in June 1990 by Wilfried Vancraen and his wife Hilde Ingelaere as a Rapid Prototyping service bureau. It was the first company of its kind in the Benelux region of Europe, through the acquisition of a single Stereolithography machine (the SLA 1).https://www.3dsystems.com/our-story In 1992, Materialise began mapping human anatomy digitally in three dimensions,Rapid Prototyping Casebook, Julia A McDonald, Chris J Ryall, David I Wimpenny. One of the earliest research projects in medical 3D printing, financed by the EU and coordinated by Materialise: https://books.google.be/books?id=F5mw7_ICelgC&pg;=PA179&lpg;=PA179&dq;=phidias+project+medical+printing&source;=bl&ots;=fVz- nwFNZA&sig;=-RqGsG6wFOWjOgB- BDc5VHkM2QY&hl;=nl&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiF7tjJlPDfAhUHNOwKHUYuCaIQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=phidias%20project%20medical%20printing&f;=false using sliced CT image data, which lead to the development of its medical image processing software: Mimics. Concurrently, the team was also developing its industrial software solution, Magics. Both of these software solutions were later commercialized to promote growth. 1995 was the year that Materialise became the first company to produce 3D printed parts\\"European Stereolithography Excellence Award\\" at the European 3D Systems user conference in 1993. https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing-news/materialise-depuy- synthes-medical-implant/ in more than one colour, specifically at this time for anatomical models produced using the stereolithography process to delineate the complexities of the anatomy (such as nerves, blood vessels and tumours) and allow surgeons to more precisely plan for operations. The company developed and produced the first customised 3D printed surgical guide for a dental operation in 1996. These personalised guides were utilised during surgery to show surgeons bone cutting and drilling locations to apply implants. This knowledge was used to develop Materialise SimPlant software, allowing the surgeon to virtually plan the surgery and minimize invasive exploratory surgery. The company launched one of the first 3D printing online ordering systems in 1997, Materialise NextDay, which later became Materialise OnSite. This service allowed 3D printing service customers to send digital 3D data, which could be printed and shipped the next day. Demand for prototypes grew, leading Materialise to develop its Mammoth Stereolithography systems, which are capable of printing single-piece models with dimensions of more than 2 meters in the Y axis. The year 2000, hearing aid specialist Phonak approached Materialise to develop the Rapid Shell Modeling (RSM) software. This allowed the design process for customized, patient-specific hearing aid shells to become automated. The resulting designs could then be 3D printed to produce the customised hearing aids. This was the first high volume, end-use application of 3D printing, and today, 99% of the world's hearing aids are now produced using 3D printing.http://ratio.se/app/uploads/2015/12/cs_3dprinting_hearingaid_262.pdf Materialise acquired US company Columbia Scientific Inc, (CSI) in 2001, the creators of Sim/Plant and ImageMaster, which became the US headquarters for Materialise's dental division in that region.https://www.leuveninc.com/event/36/996/Materialise_acquires_CSI/ In 2003 Materialise launched one of the first 3D printed consumer brands ‚Äî .MGX by Materialise ‚Äî for 3D printing end-use products as well as prototypes. In parallel, the company also acquired Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) systems for industrial applications. The following year, in 2004, Materialise introduced its 3-matic software, allowing 3D printer users to edit files directly in the STL format. Previously, if design changes were required in the digital model, designers had to make them in the CAD suite of choice before re-converting the entire file to STL again. In 2006 Materialise launched RapidFit, developed as a 3D printed solution for shipping large parts with customized jigs and fixtures to prevent deformation or breakage while in transit. In 2006 Materialise developed the first Titanium 3D printed skull implants, following the acquisition of OBL, which specialized in the creation of custom cranio-maxillfacial (CMF) implants, producing customized implants with intricate porous structures, that behave like natural bone and mimic its mechanical and thermal properties. In 2008 Materialise introduced the e-Stage software which was the first software to automatically generate support structures for different geometries in Stereolitography. In the same year, the company launched i.materialise for the consumer market, making it possible for anyone to print their ideas using professional-quality equipment. Materialise also developed its first Build Processor to support running different 3D printing processes more efficiently within a single location. In 2012, Materialise introduced Streamics to provide traceable quality control to industrial 3D printer users producing end-use parts within regulated industries. Materialise went public on June 25, 2014https://www.reuters.com/article/us-materialise-ipo/belgian-3d-printing- software-firm-materialise-files-for-u-s-ipo-idUSBREA311JU20140402 to enable expansion of its services and software development. The same year the company acquired OrthoView,https://orthostreams.com/2014/10/materialise-acquires- orthoviews-surgical-planning-tools-for-12-3m/ a market leader in orthopaedic digital pre-operative planning software and officially established a new office in China in December with a focus on 3D printing Software and R&D;, namely Materialise Shanghai Co. Ltd.https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing- news/materialise-opens-3D-printing-office-shanghai-MTLS/ In 2015, the company curated and organized the 3D printing exhibition MAKING A DIFFERENCE / A DIFFERENCE IN MAKING at the BOZAR,https://www.bozar.be in Brussels. The aim was showing the capabilities and potential of the 3D printing technology to a wider public. The event was also the launch pad for new co-created applications, notably Materialise's first collection of 3D-printed eyewear with Hoet Design Studio. Later in 2015, Materialise received the EN9100 and EASA.21G certifications to operate in the aerospace market,https://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/9948/Materialise- Goes-Airborne-After-Receiving-EN9100-Certification.aspx in addition to the ISO 9001 certification already in place.

The approach with the software development was to keep all of the software process-agnostic, so it could be used for any additive processes available on the market. At the end of 2018, Materialise released its 23rd version of Magics. A now annual update of Magics has seen the software evolve into a modular suite of products that goes beyond the original function of preparing and fixing 3D data for 3D printing. Software development centers are now found in Belgium (HQ), the United States, Germany, China, Ukraine and Malaysia.  Medical  Since the inception of Materialise, the company's founders Fried Vancraen and Hilde Ingleaere, have passionately believed in aligning the potential of 3D printing and additive manufacturing with developing applications across the medical sector to improve the tools available to doctors and surgeons, and thus indirectly improve outcomes for patients. Always mindful of the company's mission to contribute to a healthier world. The focus on software to drive the first 3D printer in 1990 provided a solid foundation for Materialise's concurrent solution-focused research into developing specific software for the production of anatomical models from CT image data. This resulted in one of the earliest research projects in medical 3D printing, financed by the EU and coordinated by Materialise.https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/6642/factsheet/en The commercial realisation of this research in 1992 is the company's MIMICS (Materialise Interactive Medical Image Control System) software. The first models to be produced using MIMICS were built by Materialise for UZ Leuven, to replicate and analyse a large bone tumor, called ‚Äúmimi,‚Äù under the EU research project. The first models to be commercially commissioned, however, were for the Centenary Clinic in Antwerp (Dr. Defrancq et al.). The \\"mimi\\" model subsequently won the \\"European Stereolithography Excellence Award\\" at the European 3D Systems user conference in 1993.https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing-news/materialise-depuy-synthes- medical-implant/ As a result, the application was presented at the USA conference in the same year. It was here that Al Dewit, the owner of a SLA service agency in Ann Arbor, MI, USA, found the application so interesting that he initiated talks with Materialise and became the first distributor of the company's software in the USA. The first sale of MIMICS software was made to Laserformhttp://www.lasergruppe.at in 1993, which was looking to produce physical models from CT scan for the MKA department of the hospital in Vienna. The MIMICS suite has continued to be developed over the years, with modular and very specific additions that have supported the evolution of dental and medical applications 3D printing. The first Materialise medical 3D printed application produced by Materialise centred around the production of customised anatomical models in the early 1990s. This is still a prolific (and growing) application of 3D printing that provides surgeons with personalised visual representations of their patients‚Äô anatomy that allows for non-invasive diagnostics, and treatment and surgical planning. By 1997, Materialise was focus its software development and 3D printing capabilities on the production of customised surgical guides. From there the progress evolved further into the development of customised implants to precisely match patient needs. Dental implants were among the first devices to be produced, with a range of orthopaedic and cranio maxillofacial (CMF) implants.https://www.tctmagazine.com/3d-printing-news/materialise-depuy- synthes-medical-implant/ Since the year 2000, Materialise has been directly involved in the development of implant applications for knees, hips, shoulder, jaws and also contributed its services to the first face transplant in 2011.http://www.phillipblondeel.com/face- transplant.htmlhttps://3dprint.com/218679/face-transplant- belgium/https://www.3ders.org/articles/20170804-dr-laurent- lantieri-3d-printing-is-revolutionizing-facial-plastic-and-reconstructive- surgery.html The medical sector, particularly for implant devices, is one that is highly regulated and compliance involves huge amounts of research data and testing. The results of much of Materialise's research is coming to fruition as the company has increasingly been certified for its software, processes and materials. In 2016, Materialise announced the first 3D printed titanium maxillofacial implants for the European and Australian markets. In 2017 they received clearance for the U.S. market from the FDA. The implant devices are part of a personalized total solution for orthognathic surgery, also known as corrective jaw surgery, as well as for facial reconstruction. This holistic solution benefits from virtual surgical planning to the 3D-printed implants used in combination with 3D-printed surgical guides. More recently, in 2018 Materialise received FDA clearance for the use of diagnostic 3D printed anatomical models, the first company in the world to do so. This was based on Materialise's Mimics inPrint portfolio (3D visualization and print preparation software) being 510k-clearedhttps://www.engineering.com/3DPrinting/3DPrintingArticles/ArticleID/16704/FDA- Clearance-for-Materialise-Software-Paves-Way-for-More-Medical-3D-Printing.aspx and available for hospitals seeking to set up 3D printing capabilities at the point-of-care.

The term is named after Ralph Alger Bagnold, who placed such a suspension in an annular coaxial cylindrical rheometer in order to investigate the effects of grain interaction in the suspension. Constitutive relations By experiments described in his 1954 paper, Bagnold showed that when a shear flow is applied to the suspension, then the shear and normal stresses in the suspension may vary linearly or quadratically with the shear rate, depending on the strength of viscous effects compared to the particles' inertia. If the shear and normal stresses in the mixture (suspension: mixture of solid and fluid) vary quadratically with the shear rate, the flow is said to satisfy Bagnold‚Äôs grain-inertia flow. If this relation is linear, then the motion is said to satisfy Bagnold‚Äôs macro-viscous flow. These relationships, particularly the quadratic relationship, are referred to as the Bagnold rheology. Although Bagnold used wax spheres suspended in a glycerin-water-alcohol mixture, many subsequent shear-cell experiments for both wet and dry mixtures, as well as computer simulations, have confirmed these relations. Bagnold's rheology can be used to describe debris and granular flows down inclined slopes. Explanation For low shear rates, dilute suspensions or suspensions involving small particles, the viscosity of the fluid is a much stronger effect than the inertia of the particles. The particles do not interact strongly with each other. By considering the forces on a particle in a fluid in the Stokes regime, it can be shown that the presence of the particle simply increases the 'effective viscosity' of the fluid. At high shear rates, the inertia of the particles is the dominant effect, and the suspension's behaviour is governed by collisions between particles. In his 1954 paper, Bagnold justified the quadratic relationship by collisional arguments. He considered an idealised situation in which layers of particles are regular, and slide and collide regularly with each other. Then the impulse of each collision between particles is proportional to the shear rate, and so is the number of collisions per unit time; and hence the total impulse on a particle per unit time is proportional to the square of the shear rate. Sedimentation If the particles in the suspension are not neutrally buoyant, then the additional effect of settling also takes place. Pudasaini (2011) used the above constitutive relations to establish a scaling law for the sedimentation time. It is found analytically that the macro-viscous fluid settles much faster than the grain-inertia fluid, as manifested by dispersive pressure. Given the same time, the macroviscous fluid is settled 6/5 unit length compared to the unit length settlement of the grain-inertia fluid as measured from the nose-tip of the flowfront that has already settled to the back side of the debris. Therefore, the macroviscous fluid settles (completely stops to flow) 20% faster than the grain-inertia fluid. Due to the dispersive pressure in grain- inertia fluid, the settlement process is delayed by 20% for the grain-inertia fluid than for the macroviscous fluid. This is meaningful because particles are more agitated due to higher dispersive pressure in grain-inertia fluids than in macroviscous fluids. Once the material comes close to rest, these dispersive forces (induced by the quadratic shear rate), are still active for grain-inertia fluid but macroviscous fluid settles relatively faster because it is less dispersive. This provides a tool to approximate and estimate the final settlement time (the time at which the entire fluid body is at rest). These are mechanically important relationships concerning the settlement time and the settlement lengths between the grain-inertia and the macroviscous fluids.

In a career that lasted from 1943 to 1945 he ran fifteen times and won six races. As a three-year-old 1944 he won the New Derby, a wartime substitute for The Derby run at Newmarket. He later developed into a specialist stayer, winning the Jockey Club Cup in the Autumn of 1944 and the Gold Cup at the following summer. He was then retired to stud where he had limited success. Background Ocean Swell, like both of his parents, was bred by his owner, the Liberal politician and former First-class cricketer, Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery, at his Mentmore Stud. He was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and white socks on both his hind legs. The colt was one of nine winners produced by the mare Jiffy, the best of the others being the 1946 Epsom Oaks runner-up Iona. Other descendants of Jiffy included the Kentucky Derby winners Tomy Lee and Genuine Risk. Ocean Swell was from the first crop of foals sired by Blue Peter, an outstanding racehorse who won the 2000 Guineas and the Derby in 1939 and went on to be champion sire on three occasions. Ocean Swell was sent into training with Jack Jarvis at his Park Lodge Stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=1943: two-year-old season Ocean Swell showed little ability in the earliest part of his career, finishing unplaced in his first three starts, before running second in the Isleham Plate at Newmarket in the autumn. On his final run of the year Ocean Swell won the six furlong Alington Plate at the same course beating a field of nineteen which included the future New St Leger winner Tehran. 1944: three-year-old season Wartime led to many racecourses being closed either for safety reasons or because the land was needed for military use. Because of this all of Ocean Swell's races in 1944 took place at Newmarket. He began promisingly by winning the Column Produce Stakes over one mile and then finished third to the Fred Darling-trained Borealis in the Lavenham Handicap before running in the 2000 Guineas. He started at odds of 33/1 in a field of twenty-six and finished unplaced behind the filly Garden Path who beat Growing Confidence by a head, with Tehran third. In the Derby, Jack Jarvis's stable jockey, Eph Smith, chose to ride Tehran and the ride on Ocean Swell went to William \\"Billy\\" Nevett, who was given leave from serving as a Private in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps to take the mount. Nevett had already won one wartime Derby on Owen Tudor, a horse who had also been rejected by his stable's main jockey. Ocean Swell started a 28/1 outsider while Garden Path and Growing Confidence disputed favouritism in a field of twenty. The early pace was slow, but the field quickened just after half way and Nevett sent his horse into the lead just over three furlongs from the finish. In a \\"furious\\" finish, Ocean Swell stayed on strongly in the closing stages, showing \\"pluck and stamina\\" to win a \\"great fight\\" by a neck from Tehran, with the fast-finishing Happy Landing a short head back in third. Ocean Swell did not race again for three months before contesting the New St Leger, in which he finished third behind Tehran and Borealis. On his final start of the year he was moved up to two and a quarter miles and showed his aptitude for extended distances by winning the Jockey Club Cup. After the race Lord Rosebery praised his colt's speed and stamina and announced that he would stay in training with the Ascot Gold Cup as his main objective. 1945: four-year-old season Like Ocean Swell, most of the top three-year-olds of 1944 stayed in training the following year, leading to speculation that the competition over middle and long distances would be particularly strong. Ocean Swell met Borealis on his first three starts as a four-year-old, all of which were at Newmarket. He won the April Stakes, but then finished second to the Darling-trained runner in the Wood Ditton Stakes. Ocean Swell next ran in a substitute Coronation Cup, in which he finished second to Borealis in a \\"great race\\", with the Oaks winner Hycilla in third. Tehran, who had been unbeaten since losing to Ocean Swell in the Derby was a late withdrawal: his trainer Frank Butters did not want to risk him on hard ground before the Ascot Gold Cup. The end of the war in Europe meant than some races were allowed to return to their traditional venues and on 7 July the Gold Cup was run at Ascot for the first time since 1939 in front of an estimated 60,000 spectators. Ocean Swell was well suited by the two and a half mile course and won by a length and a half from Tehran. He was thus the first (and remains the only) Derby winner to win the Gold Cup at Ascot since Persimmon in 1897 (Owen Tudor had won a substitute \\"Gold Cup\\" at Newmarket over a reduced distance). Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris classified Ocean Swell as an \\"average\\" Derby winner, with a rating of 131. Stud career Ocean Swell was a disappointment at stud. The only European runners of consequence he sired were the filly Sea Parrott (Yorkshire Oaks) and the successful handicapper Fastnet Rock. The best of his progeny was almost certainly the gelding St. Vincent, a minor winner in England who improved to become American Champion Male Turf Horse in 1955. Ocean Swell was put down after sustaining an injury in 1954.

History The place was frequently visited by Mr. Joseph C. Stiles, a licentiate and Evangelist of Hopewell Presbytery, who took it in as a part of his field. As the fruit of his ministry a church was organized June 18, 1826, of twenty five members, by Rev. Benjamin Gildersleeve, First Presbyterian Church was born on June 18, 1826, just three years after the city of Macon was chartered. The church continued to be a part of the Evangelistic field of Mr. Stiles, till 1828, when Rev. James C. Patterson became the regular supply for two years till the Fall of 1830. During Mr. Patterson's ministry the first building, a wooden structure, was erected on Fourth street. This building was turned over to the Baptists, who removed and enlarged it; and is now the Second Baptist church. The Rev. Edwin Holt was the first regular pastor, installed November 20, 1831, and served the church from 1831 to 1834, when the relation was dissolved by the Presbytery of Good Hope and he dismissed to the Presbytery of Newburyport July 27, 1836. He was followed by Rev. James Stratton, as supply, for two years. He was never settled. His name was stricken from the roll March 29, 1843, he \\"having joined another church.\\" He was succeeded by Rev. Samuel J. Cassels, who was installed November 5, 1836 and continued till April 13, 1842. It was during the ministry of Rev. Mr. Cassels, that the second house, a brick building commenced during the ministry of Mr. Stratton, was completed. Since 1858, when the present structure was completed, its spire, soaring 183 feet above the street, has dominated the downtown section of Mulberry Street. It is the 6th tallest building in Macon, Georgia, at 185 feet(56 m). It was the tallest building in Macon from its completion in 1858 until the completion of the St. Joseph's Catholic Church. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It is located on 690 Mulberry Street, in Downtown Macon. The famous poet Sidney Lanier was a member here. Today, the congregation has more than 1000 members.www.fpcmacon.org/new-here/who-we-are/ School In 1970, the church founded First Presbyterian Day School. The church founded the school the same year that a judge ordered Bibb County public schools to desegregate. The campus was located in a mostly white suburban area, some distance away from the church's headquarters in a black neighborhood downtown. These factors have led the historian Andrew Manis to conclude that the school was a segregation academy established to allow white parents to avoid sending their children to racially integrated public schools.

She also became the first Chinese American woman to pass the civil service exams and to occupy a government job. The San Francisco Call stated that she was \\"the first Chinese woman in the history of the world to exercise the electoral franchise.\\" Schulze was also the first Chinese woman hired to work at Angel Island. She is a designated Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. Employment In 1901, Leung was saved from an arranged marriage to an older Montana man by Donaldina Cameron, who led the Presbyterian Mission Home in San Francisco. At the Mission, Leung learned to speak English, converted to Christianity, and helped Cameron and local police rescue Chinese slaves and prostitutes from brothels. She also served as an interpreter for the Mission. She interpreted for girls from Chinatown in the courts, thus becoming widely respected in local courts. Leung worked for the Mission Home for about nine years, and developed a close relationship with Cameron. Cameron nicknamed her ‚ÄúTiny‚Äù because Leung stood a little over four feet tall. In 1910, when the Angel Island immigration station opened, Cameron recommended Leung to take a job at the Angel Island Immigration Station as an interpreter for Chinese immigrants. Leung was the first Chinese American to pass the civil service examinations and she was hired to work as an assistant to the matron at the Angel Island Immigration Station. The matron who received her commission from Washington D.C. previously came from the Immigration Bureau on Ellis Island. Leung was also the first Chinese woman to be appointed by the federal government. At Angel Island, she would work with Chinese immigrants who were detained for physical examinations and interrogation upon their arrival. When interviewed about her experience working at Angel Island, Leung said: ‚ÄúDull?‚Äînever. Always sitting there listening to my countrymen. I listen for little scraps about the great new movement over the sea, that is setting them free over there as I have been set free here.‚Äù After losing her job at Angel Island due to her marriage with Charles Schulze, Leung spent many years providing interpretation and social services to San Francisco's Chinatown residents. For a year, she worked at the Chinese Tea Garden. She served as an administrative clerk, bookkeeper, and social worker at the San Francisco Chinese Hospital to support her family. Beginning in 1926 for 20 years, Leung went to work as a night-shift PBX operator for the Pacific Telephone's China Exchange in Chinatown, a higher- class job for women at the time. She facilitated the lives of many Chinese Americans by connecting them with lawyers, courts, and immigration services. As a telephone operator, she had to memorize telephone numbers for everyone and every store in Chinatown. She became respected across Chinatown for her skills and connections in assisting Chinese Americans. Leung‚Äôs son, Fred, recalled that ‚Äúshe was always asked to interpret. GI brides, immigration, court cases. She never refused to help.‚Äù In 1946, Leung was hired by the Immigration Office to work as an interpreter for a year. Since the War Brides Act of 1945 was enacted, lifting the temporary ban on Asian immigration, many Chinese wives were joining their husbands in the United States, creating the need for translators. For members of the Chinese community in San Francisco, Leung also offered her translation services. These translations helped to make her a community fixture.  Suffrage work  In May of 1912, Leung was the first Chinese woman to vote in a presidential primary election. Leung who was in her early twenties, may have also been the first Chinese woman worldwide to cast a vote. At the time of her vote, she was still living and working for the Presbyterian Mission House, which is known as the Cameron House today. Leung voted at a polling place at Powell and Pacific streets in San Francisco. After voting the San Francisco Examiner called the vote \\"the last word in the modern movement for the complete enfranchisement of women...It was the latest achievement in the great American work of amalgamating and lifting up all the races of the earth.\\" The San Francisco Examiner stated that Leung was ‚Äúaltogether familiar with the political issues involved in the primary presidential election.‚Äù Leung was interviewed about her experience with her first vote: \\"My first vote? ‚Äì Oh, yes, I thought long over that. I studied; I read about all your men who wished to be president. I learned about the new laws. I wanted to KNOW what was right, not to act blindly...I think it right we should all try to learn, not vote blindly, since we have been given this right to say which man we think is the greatest...I think too that we women are more careful than the men. We want to do our whole duty more. I do not think it is just the newness that makes use like that. It is conscience.\\" In 1911, the year before Leung cast her first vote, California became the sixth state to pass laws that granted equal suffrage, after Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. California‚Äôs suffrage laws were passed nearly a decade before the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920  Marriage  While working at Angel Island she met immigration inspector Charles Frederick Schulze. Schulze was Caucasian and the intermarriage of Chinese and white Americans was illegal as a result of California's anti-miscegenation laws in 1913. As a result, the couple went to Vancouver, Washington to be legally married. They were married in October 1913. The couple's families, however, did not approve of their marriage. After the marriage the couple came back to California, but both lost their government jobs due to racial prejudice. They had four children: Frederick, Theodore, Louise, and Donaldina. After losing his job, Schulze went to work shortly as a special patrol officer and street- car motorman. He then worked for the Southern Pacific Company as an \\"inspector of office machines\\", and then as a superintendent of service for the Columbia Gramaphone Company.Original business cards of Charles Schulze Schulze passed away in 1935.  Other Social Activism  When abortion was illegal, 61-year- old Leung, along with four others, were arrested for their roles in what was believed to be a statewide abortion ring. Leung was tipped off by a San Francisco girl who was flown to Los Angeles for an abortion that cost $400. Following an investigation and trial, charges against Leung were dropped in December 1948. Personal life Tye Leung in a Studebaker, 1912 Tye Leung was born on August 24th in San Francisco, California in 1887. She was the youngest of five sisters and two brothers to Chinese immigrants from the Guangdong province. Her father was a Chinese cobbler, earning $20 a month, while her mother ran a boarding house. Leung‚Äôs family of ten and a few other relatives lived in a cramped two-room apartment on Ross Alley in San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown. Leung was sent to Presbyterian school to learn English, and was often taken to church meetings, which were her earliest exposures to Christianity. When she was nine, Leung was sent by her mother to work as a ‚Äúservant‚Äù in another household, not realizing that she had been sold to another family. Leung‚Äôs uncle, who realized her situation, consulted Leung‚Äôs school teachers who arranged for her to return home. Later as a teenager she was placed in an arranged marriage to a man from Butte, Montana. Leung‚Äôs older sister, who was originally to be married to the man, had escaped the marriage by running away with her boyfriend. As a result, her parents intended for Leung to marry the same man. At 14 she was saved from the arranged marriage by Donaldina Cameron of the Presbyterian Mission Home. When pinball machines were introduced to Chinatown in the 1930s, Leung built a reputation for herself locally as a pinball wizard. She was famously photographed in a Studebaker. Many compared Leung to Sun Yat-sen, who also embraced democracy and had an affinity for Studebaker convertibles. Leung passed at the age of 84 in San Francisco on March 10, 1972. Legacy Leung was recognized for her contributions to women's history in 1987 in the San Bernardino Sun newspaper. In October 2011 the story of Tye Leung Schulze was told through a play starring actress Lily Tung. Further reading * Yung, Judy.

Danish traditional music (Danish: spillemandsmusik) is the music genre that has its roots in pre-modern Denmark. In this period it was common for towns to have one or more town musicians (Danish: spillemand) who played at dances, processions and certain rituals. In the 17th and 18th centuries, professional music performances were monopolized by town musicians, who also traveled into the neighboring rural areas to perform. Urban music and dance styles, often from other parts of Europe, penetrated the countryside and almost eradicated earlier styles. This period also saw the introduction of the fiddle as the most important instrument and the abandonment of earlier chain dances in favor of pair dances. Until around 1900, traditional music was the common musical culture of Denmark, but with increasing urbanization and the spread of classical music it became marginalized to rural areas.B√¶k 2006:11-44 History Through the Middle Ages and into the 19th century there are reports of \\"chain dances\\", processions and ceremonial dances accompanied by pipes, drums and singing. In the 17th and 18th centuries, throughout Denmark the practice of music was under the monopoly of the appointed city musicians (stadsmusikant), who with their journeymen and apprentices were the only musicians allowed to play for a salary within an assigned territory. Since the city musician was trained in the cities, this meant that courtly repertoires made their way into the countryside, and that most areas did not maintain local musical traditions during this time. Only a few areas, such as Bornholm and Amager, never had the stadsmusikant monopoly, and a few others such as Fan√∏ maintained a local tradition by an arrangement whereby local musicians leased the right to perform on the island from the city musician of Ribe. Since city musicians frowned on the use of instruments deemed impure such as drums, bagpipes and hurdy-gurdies, this period also saw the rise of the fiddle as the main instrument for dance music.Koudal 1997 From around 1500, medieval chain dances were displaced by pair dances. The oldest known pair dance in Denmark is the pols, an adapted variant of a Polish dance that was popular in Sweden as early as the 16th century. It is assumed that the pols was prevalent in the Danish countryside by the second half of the 17th century, and in the 18th century it was the most common popular dance along with the minuet. These Polish dances were usually performed in two parts: a slow march and a faster 3/4 second part. Often in the oldest hand-written tune books only the first part was written, as the fiddler improvised the second half based on the first. From the end of the 18th century English-style contra and square dances became popular. In the 19th century the waltz became the most popular dance in the cities, after having been known in the countryside for a while. Other dance types of the early 19th century are hopsa, rheinl√¶nder, galop, sveitrit and schottish all of which were integrated into the popular English style dances, and later developed their own local dance forms. Around 1850 the polka and mazurka entered the popular repertoire. At the end of the 19th century the earlier dance tradition began to lose its place to modern dances from England, Southern Europe and America.Urup 1976 From the local tradition of the island of Fan√∏ the tune types s√∏nderhoning and fannik have made their way into the standard repertoire of Danish traditional music, and are remnants of the early tradition of Polish derived dances.Urup, Henning. \\"De danske polsk-danse.\\" The Danish Polish-dances), and Dansk spillemandsmusiks forudssetninger: 80-94. To counter the loss of traditional dances, the Association for the Promotion of Folkdancing was founded in 1901, focusing on the preservation of popular dances from the period 1750-1850. Many local chapters of such preservation societies appeared during the first decades of the 20th century, and in 1929 there were as many as 16,000 members. These dance associations had a homogenizing effect on the popular dances, creating a standard repertoire of Danish folk dances. They often danced in folk dress. In response to this homogenizing effect of the folkdancing guilds, informal dance organizations working to keep local dance traditions alive in informal settings were also developed, under the name of \\"Old Dance\\". Certain rural areas of Denmark such as Fan√∏, L√¶s√∏, √Ür√∏ and parts of Western Jutland maintained living traditions of dancing from the late 18th century well into the 20th century.B√¶k 2006:20-34 Sources and history of scholarship The earliest known Danish traditional music comes from the handwritten tune collections of musicians, such as the large collection of tunes by Rasmus Storm (ca. 1760). Collection of Danish folkmelodies began in the early 19th century, and figures such as Svend Grundtvig (1824‚Äì83), A. P. Berggreen (1801-80) and Evald Tang Kristensen (1843-1929) published significant collections of tunes and songs. In the early 20th century with the establishment of the field of ethnology in Denmark, the collection of folk tradition including music, song, and dances began in earnest.B√¶k 2006:4-8 CitationsBibliography *B√¶k, John. 2006.

While his initial career in the infantry branch and then General Staff during the French Revolutionary Wars was unremarkable, Lh√©ritier made a name for himself as a cavalry commander during the Napoleonic Wars. A gallant officer, he led from the front and, as a result, collected a number of serious battle wounds. He was created a Baron of the Empire and a Commander of the Legion of Honour and his name is inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Having begun his military career in 1792, he joined the cavalry branch on a permanent basis in 1803 and subsequently saw steady promotion and was given various commands of heavy cavalry units. A part of the Grande Arm√©e in 1805, he took part to the War of the Third Coalition. In 1806, at the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition, Lh√©ritier was promoted to Colonel and given the command of the 10th Cuirassiers. In this capacity, he was noted for his brave charge at the Battle of Eylau in 1807. Two years later, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, he made an impression on his superiors, especially during the Battle of Aspern-Essling and Battle of Znaim. As a result, he was promoted to Brigadier General and given the command of a cuirassier brigade, before taking part to the French invasion of Russia in 1812. The next year, he was promoted to General of Division and was given various commands during the War of the Sixth Coalition. During the 1815 War of the Seventh Coalition, Baron Lh√©ritier commanded a mixed dragoon and cuirassier division, at the head of which he charged during the Battle of Waterloo. Lh√©ritier's active service effectively ended soon after Napoleon I's second abdication, but he did hold two significant military functions during the Second Restoration. Revolutionary Wars Born in Angles-sur-l'Anglin on 6 August 1772,Fierro, Palluel-Guillard, Tulard p. 907. Lh√©ritier joined the army on 26 September 1792, aged 20Lapray p. 156. and he would spend his first years of service fighting in the French Revolutionary Wars, with action taking place mainly on the Rhine. Upon joining the army, he was at first commissioned as a mere grenadier in the 3rd Indre-et-Loire battalion, before being promoted to Corporal, in command of the battalion's grenadiers (22 December 1792). The next year, on 18 August 1793, he was appointed secretary to the General Staff of the Army of the Rhine and then provisional deputy of the general adjutants of the army, with the rank of Sub-lieutenant of infantry (17 May 1794), his first junior officer rank. His rank as Sub-lieutenant was at first provisional and was only rendered permanent two and a half years later, on 4 December 1796. On 2 January 1797, he was appointed aide-de-camp to General Jacques Nicolas Bellav√®ne and saw rapid promotion, first to Lieutenant on 3 April 1797 and then to Captain on 5 October 1797. With his second promotion came a new General Staff position, this time with General Jean Boudet's command. On 14 June 1800, Captain Lh√©ritier fought at the decisive Battle of Marengo, where he collected a severe thigh wound. Six weeks after the battle, on 28 July 1800, he was transferred from the General Staff to the Cavalry branch of the army and was attached to the 6th Dragoons. Completely healed from his injury on 23 October of that year, he was detached from his regiment and, from November reassumed staff duties, as aide-de-camp to General Jean Ambroise Baston de Lariboisi√®re. However, he soon moved back to cavalry, as, on 19 September 1801 he was promoted to Squadron Commander in the 9th Cavalry. Following the various reforms of the cavalry branch during this period of peace, Lh√©ritier was again commissioned aide-de-camp on 16 December 1801, a position that he held until 26 August 1803, when he was decommissioned. He resumed service a few months later, on 13 October 1803 and on 15 December of that year, he was given a position in the 11th Cuirassiers, a regiment that had been created in 1803 from what used to be the 11th Cavalry.Bukhari p. 25. Early Napoleonic Wars Cuirassiers in 1805, painting by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier. With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, Napoleon I formed the Grande Arm√©e and organised most of his cavalry in a large Cavalry Reserve corps under Marshal of the Empire Joachim Murat. Lh√©ritier continued to serve in the 11th Cuirassiers and in 1805 this regiment was included in General Raymond-Gaspard de Bonardi de Saint-Sulpice's 2nd Brigade of Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division. The 11th Cuirassiers itself was under the command of Colonel Albert Louis Emmanuel de Fouler. The regiment was heavily engaged at the Battle of Austerlitz, where it lost 14 dead and 37 wounded out of its pre-battle complement of 327 men.Smith p. 253-254. The regiment and its officers fought brilliantly and shortly after the battle, Colonel Fouler was promoted to Brigadier General.Lapray p. 96. The next year saw the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition, which opposed France to Prussia and Russia. On 5 October 1806, Lh√©ritier was promoted to Colonel and given the command of the 10th Cuirassiers, a prestigious heavy cavalry regiment, formerly called Royal Cravates during the Ancien R√©gime,Lapray p. 240. and which traced its origins back to the reign of Louis XIII. The regiment was a part of Marie Adrien Fran√ßois Guiton's 2nd Brigade of General d'Hautpoul's 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division.Hourtoulle, D'Eylau √† Friedland, p. 104. The division saw no major action during the 1806 campaign, but was heavily engaged at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807. There, Colonel Lh√©ritier led his cuirassiers during Marshal Murat's famous cavalry charge. Lh√©ritier was wounded at his right hand when his horse was killed under him, but was soon back in the saddle and took off again at the head of his regiment in another charge. His senior commander, General d'Hautpoul, was fatally wounded during his heroic charge at Eylau. The 10th Cuirassiers took little part in the fighting that followed that battle. d'Hautpoul, here portrayed as a General of the Revolution, was Lh√©ritier's divisional commander between 1805 and 1807. The next significant engagement came in 1809, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, against Austria. The 10th Cuirassiers were again a part of General Guiton's 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Heavy Cavalry Division, now under the command of General Saint-Sulpice, who had taken divisional command following the death of d'Hautpoul in 1807.Castle p. 17. The regiment, numbering 4 squadrons and a complement of 610 men, saw action at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, where Colonel Lh√©ritier bravely led from the front and received a bullet wound to the right shoulder and had a horse shot under him. Six weeks later, at the Battle of Wagram, the 10th Cuirassiers saw brief combat and had only one officer wounded.Hourtoulle, Wagram l'apog√©e de l'Empire, p. 106. The next engagement for the regiment came on 11 July at the Battle of Znaim. There, Colonel Lh√©ritier was again noted for his bravery, as he led his men into action and in the process received a severe wound at the head. His actions during the campaign of 1809 were regarded very highly and on 21 July 1809, he was promoted to Brigadier General. General in the Grande Arm√©e Having been promoted to Brigadier General on 21 July 1809, Lh√©ritier left his regiment the next day and was given command of the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division. His command included the 7th and 8th Cuirassiers, but his brigade saw no action, as an armistice had been signed at Znaim on 12 July and the two parties were moving towards signing a peace treaty. The War of the Fifth Coalition ended on 14 October 1809 and General Lh√©ritier was discharged from his position on 1 May 1810. For almost a year, he was not given any assignment, but, on 26 March 1811, he was named inspector of the cavalry depots of the 1st, 15th, 21st and 22nd military divisions, then inspector of the remounts for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th military divisions (7 May 1811). He was subsequently given a field command, as he was placed at the helm of the 2nd brigade of General Jean-Pierre Doumerc's 3rd Heavy Cavalry Division (7 May 1811). During the upcoming French Invasion of Russia, General Lh√©ritier's brigade was noted for fighting with distinction at the Second Battle of Polotsk on 18‚Äì20 October 1812, but by then the outcome of the campaign had already been sealed and the remains of the once mighty Grande Arm√©e pulled out of Russia. The next year, on 15 March 1813, Lh√©ritier was promoted to the rank of general of division and on 1 July was given the command of the 4th Heavy Cavalry Division of III Cavalry Corps. A few weeks later, on 8 August, he was given another command, that of several cavalry brigades from √âdouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's V bis Cavalry Corps, before having to take over the provisional command of the entire corps, during Milhaud's absence. During the summer campaign in Saxony, Lh√©ritier was noted above all for his actions at the Battle of Giesh√ºbel on 22 August. Towards the end of the year, on 5 October, he was given the command of the 5th Heavy Cavalry division, which was entirely composed of dragoons. The 1814 campaign took place on French soil and Napoleon reorganised his army for the defense of the country's frontiers. As a result, on 5 January, General Lh√©ritier was given the command of the 6th Heavy Cavalry division, then, at the end of January, the 4th Dragoon Division. He led his men into combat with distinction at virtually all the major battles of the campaign, including Brienne, La Rothi√®re and Saint-Dizier. Bourbon Restoration and beyond Following Napoleon's abdication, Lh√©ritier swore his allegiance to the Bourbon Restoration but from 1 June 1814 he was placed on half pay. Towards the end of the year, he was appointed Inspector General for cavalry in the 16th military division and took charge of this new function at the beginning of 1815. When Napoleon returned from exile and reclaimed power in France, Lh√©ritier rallied to his cause and was given a first field command on 23 April, namely the cavalry reserve of IV Army Corps. Then, on 3 June 1815, he was named commander of the 11th cavalry division, a mixed force composed of dragoons and cuirassiers. His direct subordinates were Brigadier General Cyrille Simon Picquet, in command of the 1st Brigade (2nd and 7th Dragoons) and none other than his former commander from 1806‚Äì1807 and 1809, Brigadier General Guiton, in command of the 2nd Brigade (8th and 11th Cuirassiers). The entire division was a part of Fran√ßois Etienne de Kellermann's III Cavalry Corps of the \\"Army of the North\\".Smith p. 299.Lapray p. 113. Waterloo and bravely charged the Allied infantry squares. Painting by Henri F√©lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux. When the \\"Army of the North\\" attacked the forces of the Seventh Coalition in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, Kellermann, with Lh√©ritier's division, was placed under the command of Marshal Michel Ney. On 16 June, Ney faced a massed Allied force at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Of Lh√©ritier's 11th cavalry division, only Guiton's cuirassier brigade was present and available for action. As Ney's situation became increasingly desperate, the Marshal ordered Kellermann to take his cuirassiers in a frontal charge against the enemy. The charge was very well handled and, despite the difficult terrain and the large numbers of the enemy, it did much to relieve the pressure on the French forces. At first, it broke Hugh Halkett's forces, then Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel's German infantry, eventually reaching the crucial Quatre Bras crossroads. However, this breakthrough could not be exploited, as no other units had been sent in immediate support of the heavy cavalry. The cuirassiers endured some close-range musketry before finally turning and retreating at a trot, a manoeuvre during which Kellermann had his horse shot under him and barely escaped capture.Pigeard p. 692. Two days later, the entire III Corps was reunited under Kellermann's command and was available for action at the Battle of Waterloo. Lh√©ritier's division was committed towards 17:30, during the afternoon attacks, as Ney sent in his cavalry in mass against the Allied centre. A series of charges ensued, but such a cavalry attack, without proper infantry or artillery support was always set to fail on an uneven battlefield such as the one at Waterloo and against an infantry that had plenty of time to form protective squares. Despite the effortsof the French cavalryPigeard p. 934-937. ‚Äì Lh√©ritier's division alone lost six officers dead, three mortally wounded and forty wounded ‚Äì the battle was lost. During this action, Lh√©ritier received a bullet wound to the right shoulder. Napoleon abdicated a second time following his defeat at Waterloo and, as the Bourbons returned to power in France, Lh√©ritier was placed on the non-active list on 20 September 1815. Although he was not called upon again for field service, the Bourbons did offer him the position of Inspector General for cavalry and subsequently for gendarmerie. He died on 23 August 1829 in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, near Paris. Recognition Samuel-Fran√ßois Lh√©ritier was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 15 June 1804, Officer of the same order on 14 May 1807 and Commander of the order on 24 August 1814. He was also created a Baron of the Empire in May 1808. The name LHERITIER is inscribed under the eastern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

History Lori Jacobs and Dana Iliev met while working at Grumpy's, a deli restaurant in Toledo. After living in New York City, Jacobs did not like the gourmet cupcake shops found in the city but thought that a cupcake shop would be a good addition in Toledo. Agreeing with Jacobs, the two bought a cupcake book, started making recipes, and developed their own business plan. Before opening the shop, the two sold cupcakes out of Iliev's kitchen, neither one having any formal training. In order to get publicity for the new business, Jacobs and Iliev appeared on the radio, on blogs, and delivered cupcake samples and menus to high end hair salons and other establishments. Cupcakes These are some of the gourmet cupcakes sold at the shop. The shop has more than thirty flavors in all, but only have certain flavors available each month. The shop also has a daily menu with five flavors rotating every day. Chocolate, vanilla, and red velvet are sold every day. Every cupcake is made from scratch with fresh ingredients. Cupcakes are sold for $2.50 each or $25 a dozen. The shop also does catering for weddings and other events in addition to walk in customers. Cake in a Cup usually sells 400-800 cupcakes on the weekdays and up to 1,500 on weekends. The goal each day is to sell out, however when they do not, the shop offers something called leftover alerts in which fans can get a discounted price on cupcakes by accessing the Facebook page and being the first to call into the shop. Television The shop was featured on the Food Network television show Cupcake Wars and won the top $10,000 prize. The episode's theme was the art and film of director Tim Burton. Their winning cupcake was a chocolate cupcake with stout beer, frosted with chocolate ganache, and topped with lime green buttercream. It was decorated with upside down white chocolate chips so it would look like a mushroom, a common symbol in Tim Burton's artwork. Other cupcakes presented on the show were a blood orange and currant jam cupcake symbolizing blood, a red velvet cupcake with a red fondant heart to represent the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland, and a lemon blueberry cupcake drawing from the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory character, Violet.

Sponsored by Alceste De Ambris, Benito Mussolini and Angelo Oliviero Olivetti, it was connected to the world of revolutionary interventionists and inspired by the programmatic manifesto called Revolutionary Fasces of International Action, dated 5 October 1914. It exhausted its action with the intervention of Italy in the First World War in May 1915, but almost all of them met in 1919 in Piazza San Sepolcro for the foundation of the Italian Fasces of Combat, which preceded the National Fascist Party founded in 1921. History In 1915, members of the Fasci began to officially refer to themselves as \\"Fascists.\\" They denounced Marxism, but asserted that they supported socialism, using the famous quote by French socialist Louis Auguste Blanqui: \\"He who has iron has bread\\" on the title page of its newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia.O'Brien, Paul. Mussolini in the First World War: The Journalist, The Soldier, The Fascist. Mussolini spoke of his desire that the war would \\"perhaps see a few more crowns fall to pieces.\\" In April 1915, he accused Italy's King Victor Emmanuel III of being a pro-German \\"Philistine,\\" charging him of being \\"foreign\\" and allegedly a \\"neutralist.\\" Due to Mussolini's support of Italian intervention in the then-ongoing World War I, he received financial support from Ansaldo (an armaments firm) and other companies.Smith, Dennis Mack. [1979] 1997. Modern Italy: A Political History. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. In 1917, Mussolini was allegedly supported by the British Directorate of Military Intelligence, with Mussolini supposedly being paid a ¬£100 weekly wage; this help is said to have been authorised by Sir Samuel Hoare. However, regardless of the financial support he accepted for his pro-interventionist stance, Mussolini's socialist critics noted that Mussolini was free to write whatever he wished in his newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia, without prior sanctioning by his financial backers. The first meeting of the Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria was held on 24 January 1915. At the meeting Mussolini declared that it was necessary for Europe to resolve its national problems - including national borders - of Italy and elsewhere \\"for the ideals of justice and liberty for which oppressed peoples must acquire the right to belong to those national communities from which they descended.\\" Amidst discussion on the question of irredentism, Mussolini noted from the proceedings of the members that \\"the difficult question of irredentism was posed and resolved in the ambit of ideals of socialism and liberty which do not however exclude the safeguarding of a positive national interest.\\" In March 1915, Mussolini declared the movement's irredentist stance towards Trieste, in which he stated that Trieste \\"must be, and will be Italian through war against the Austrians and, if necessary, against the Slavs.\\" In an article on 6 April 1915, Mussolini addressed the movement's irredentist stance towards Dalmatia, arguing that Italy should not annex all of Dalmatia because claims that it had a majority of Italian speakers was \\"not a good enough reason to claim exclusive possession of all of Dalmatia\\" It did support Italy annexing a vast section of Dalmatia including its entire archipelago. The Fasci received ideological influence from other members than Mussolini, such as Giuseppe Prezzolini, who had previously been a member of the Italian Nationalist Association. Prezzolini was impressed by Mussolini, and in late 1914 joined Il Popolo d'Italia to write for it. On 11 April 1915 during an interventionist demonstration that was confronted by neutralist PSI members, Italian state police killed one man, an electrician named Innocente Marcora. Both interventionists and neutralists were outraged by the man's death. The Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria, who by then referred to themselves as \\"Fascists\\", took part in a joint neutralist-interventionist work stoppage.
