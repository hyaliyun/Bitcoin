The stadium has a capacity of 3,900, in recent years seats along the base lines have been removed and replaced with standing room area reducing the capacity.Ballpark information Melbourne Ballpark  Pre-Construction  The Victorian Baseball Association was granted 50,000 by the State Government of Victoria in the early 1980s to construct a grandstand around the outfield fence of Ross Straw Field in Parkville (Then home of the VBA), However, due to local resident and City of Melbourne opposition this did not eventuate.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, After the disappointment of Ross Straw Field the Victorian Baseball Association spent the next 10 years lobbying state government for a venue that Baseball and Softball in Victoria could call their own home. The Department of Sport and Recreation commissioned consultants Loader & Bailey to make a list of locations for a possible venue, A short list of 8 locations was made that included; Brunswick Cricket Ground at number 1, Albert Park at the South Melbourne Cricket Ground, Dandenong North (cnr Heatherton and Stud road) and Altona at number 5.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark,  Construction  When Laverton was selected as the location for the Stadium there was much opposition in the Victorian Baseball Association over its selection, ABC commentator and Waverley Baseball Club coach Dick Mason took his concerns to the Minister for Sport and had the construction postponed while the Government reviewed the location.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, Former Victorian Baseball Association president and Australia Baseball Federation director Ron Smith was the major driving force behind the selection of the Laverton location, he reasoned that the land was free and more money could be spent on developing the venue instead of buying somewhere to build it, However other land more centrally located was also offered for free.Time and Game: The History of Australian Baseball, Joe Clark, In 1988 the funds were released and construction of the stadium started not long after, it was completed in 1989 in time for the maiden season of the ABL. The official opening was held in January 1990 and was officially opened by the Minister for Sport, the Honourable Neil Trezise.Ballpark information Melbourne Ballpark  Renovations  Before the 1996-97 ABL season the Melbourne Monarchs installed a new home run fence in front of the existing fence to make the park more 'hitter friendly'. Super Box corporate seating was also installed at ground level behind home plate extending from each dugout around the back net, Super Box seating was also installed in one bay of the undercover seating. In 2000 the original AstroTurf infield was replaced with a new improved surface at a cost of $250,000.Ballpark information Melbourne Ballpark In the mid-2000s the bleacher seating along the first base line was leveled and a grassed family picnic area was installed, the third base side was done the year after.Ballpark information Melbourne Ballpark In mid-2012 a $300,000 upgrade of the stadium funded by Sport and Recreation Victoria was undertaken, upgrades included; * New Homerun fence constructed and moved in 10m, * New state-of-the-art synthetic infield surface, that will allow players to wear metal cleats, * Outfield grass re-leveled and re-seeded, * Foul ball poles, * Landscaping entrance, * Upgraded and repaired lights and announcement systems, * Dugouts expanded with new front protection provided, * Replacement of corporate boxes at ground level, * Upgraded players change rooms.Ballpark treated to major makeover, Baseball Victoria, Kingsley Collins, Tuesday, 16 October 2012 Future improvements will include new batting cage and bullpens down each foul ball line.  Baseball  The Ballpark hosted the Melbourne Monarchs and Melbourne Bushrangers in the original Australian Baseball League, after the league collapsed in 1999 the stadium was used mostly by Baseball Victoria with Baseball Victoria Summer League night games played at the venue. The 2002 IBLA season was held at the ballpark, This was the first time a national championship game/series had been held at the ballpark since the collapse of the ABL in 1999. The Melbourne Aces have called the stadium home since their 3rd year in the new ABL for the 2012/13 Australian Baseball League season. After the Aces first two years playing at the Melbourne Showgrounds, moving to a purpose built baseball stadium offered much more convenience and flexibility towards what they could offer Aces fans. A previous attempt to lure the Aces to the Melbourne Ballpark in 2010 was unsuccessful.Altona misses out on baseball club , Hobsons Bay Leader, Stella Tzobanakis, 28 October 2010 Since the Aces moved to Melbourne Ballpark, Melbourne has hosted the ABL All-Star game six years in row from 2012-2017, leading many to agree that Melbourne Ballpark is the best baseball venue in the country.  Softball  The Ballpark has hosted Australian Softball National Championships since its opening in 1990, and also hosted games for the former National Softball Fastpitch League. In 2006 the inaugural Commonwealth Softball Championships between New Zealand, Australia, Samoa and South Africa.

History  Samuel Fox bought a disused corn mill close by the centre of the town in 1842 and made alterations so that he could produce wire for the manufacture of textile pins. Within 6 years the business began to manufacture wire for umbrella frames and he developed his own variant, the ‚ÄúParagon‚Äù in 1851. Expansion continued and by the mid-1860s furnaces and rolling mills had been built and the production of railway lines and springs begun. Road transport in the area was difficult and with larger products being manufactured a new outlet was required. In the 1870s a short branch line was built to link the works with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Deepcar. This was known as the Stocksbridge Railway which was a subsidiary of the main company until the early 1990s. The line is still open (2016) and handles regular traffic to and from the works.  Rationalisation  Samuel Fox & Company joined with Steel, Peech and Tozer of Rotherham and Scunthorpe-based Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company to form the United Steel Companies after the First World War. Products from various sites were coordinated, each works specialising in a particular range. At Stocksbridge they specialised special steels, particularly the various grades of stainless steel. LNER no. 2512 Silver Fox showing the stainless steel fox motif in the centre of the boiler side In 1935, the company provided a pair of stainless steel foxes to the London and North Eastern Railway which were used to decorate the sides of their new Class A4 locomotive no. 2512 Silver Fox. The iconic stainless steel Fox weather vane was made by Trevor Faulkner ARCA FRBS, his first commission, whilst he was a student at the Royal College of Art in the 1950s. Trevor Faulkner grew up in Stocksbridge and family members worked at Samuel Fox.  Nationalisation and after  The works, along with other major producers in Great Britain, were nationalised in 1967, to become British Steel Corporation. During the 1980s and 1990s the works became part of a joint British Steel / GKN venture known as \\"Stocksbridge Engineering Steels\\" and in 1999 they became part of Corus. The works is still open although steel stock is brought from the main melting site at Aldwarke, near Rotherham, for secondary processing. In 2007 the site was bought by Tata Steel and has been renamed Tata Steel Speciality Steels. Investment at the site has continued and a high-tech Vacuum Induction Melting furnace was due to be commissioned early in 2015. Liberty House Group Purchased the Speciality Steels group from TATA in May 2017. The name adopted for the new group was Liberty Speciality Steels. The group comprised the Site at Aldwarke, Brinsworth, Bolton, Stocksbridge and Wednesbury. References * Various issues of internal works newspaper Steel News.

This provided additional line capacity for Ayrshire Coast and Kilmarnock services. The loop line was used for passenger services until the mid-1960s, when it was closed by the Beeching Axe. The majority of the line's trackbed has since been absorbed into the Sustrans National Cycle Network. History =The main line to Ayr= The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;) had opened its main line between Glasgow and Ayr in 1839 - 1840. From Paisley the route ran through Johnstone, Dalry and Irvine. Between Glasgow and Paisley, the route was the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Line, operated jointly with the competing Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway. After amalgamations, the Ayr line was part of the system of the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) and the Greenock line formed part of the Caledonian Railway, a bitter rival of the G&SWR.; As well as the traffic for Ayr, the G&SWR; ran trains to Carlisle over the route as far as Dalry, then diverging to Kilmarnock. =The Paisley Canal line= Over the following decades the route became increasingly busy, as mineral traffic in particular grew in volume, competing for line capacity with express and local passenger trains and ordinary goods trains. On the Joint Line, the traffic of two routes was carried, and the G&SWR; decided to construct a line to by-pass the Joint Line. This became the Paisley Canal Line, which opened in 1885. Running from a junction at the south-western margin of Glasgow, the Canal Line rejoined the Ayr main line west of Paisley, at Elderslie. This gave the G&SWR; an independent route from its Glasgow passenger terminal, St Enoch station, and its principal goods depot there, at College. However the route followed the course of the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal, now filled in, and the multiple curves on the route prevented high speed running. =Johnstone North= The 1896 extension to North JohnstoneThe Ayr main line had always had a station at Johnstone, and the terminal basin of the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal was nearby. However industrial activity developed more intensively in the area north and east of the town. This was due in part to the availability of water power from the Black Cart Water, which ran round the north of the town, with extensive mill leats constructed serving textile mills by 1857. In addition, ironstone and coal deposits were being worked, with at least two tramways serving them by the same date.Anthony Slaven, The Development of the West of Scotland, 1750 - 1960, Routledge, London, 1975 reprinted 2006, Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, Six Inches to One Mile, published 1863 The G&SWR; responded to this by opening the first Linwood branch, from Linwood Junction to Linclive and Candren Ironstone pits, both immediately east of Linwood village. This line too was in existence by 1857. Johnstone railways in 1896In 1864 the Bridge of Weir Railway was opened from Johnstone station to Bridge of Weir. Nominally independent at first, it was sponsored and worked by the G&SWR;, and later taken over by them and extended to Greenock. This line gave a closer connection to the Linwood pits, to Johnstone Gas Works, and to ironworks and foundries that were established north of the town. In 1895 the G&SWR; built a branch line to a new station in Johnstone: Johnstone North. The line left the Greenock line at Cart Junction and ran west to Johnstone North station, located immediately north of Johnstone Bridge (over the Cart). This connected much of the industry, especially the expanding textile works and mineral extraction sites. The station was a terminus, and some of the trains on the Paisley Canal line ran to the stations. The line opened on 1 August 1896. At Cart Junction further short industrial lines served local factories. =Through to Dalry= Dalry & North Johnstone Railway in 1905The congestion problem on the main line continued to worsen. Although the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway had opened in 1871, allowing traffic from Glasgow to Carlisle to be diverted away from the Dalry line, the heavy mineral traffic arising directly on the route continued to cause serious line capacity problems, and the GS&WR; decided to build a new line from Johnstone North to Dalry, where the line divided for Ayr and Kilmarnock respectively. The Johnstone North branch line had not been built for fast running, so the new line duplicated the original branch line, taking an easier course with gentle curvature. Leaving Cart Junction on a sweeping radius, it ran north of the earlier line until just before Johnstone North, crossing to the south of it, making a new station there adjoining and immediately south of the earlier terminus. The line opened on 1 June 1905,Stephenson Locomotive Society, The Glasgow and South Western Railway 1850 - 1923, published by the Stephenson Locomotive Society, London, 1950 The original branch line remained active, serving industrial sidings, but closed to passenger trains. From Johnstone North the line ran broadly parallel to the original Ayr line, but north of Castle Semple Loch and Kilbirnie Loch. New stations were erected at Kilbarchan, Lochwinnoch, and Kilbirnie, and the route rejoined the Ayr main line at Brownhill Junction, north of Dalry, by a flying junction: the first in Scotland. Quadruple track was provided from the junction through Dalry station as far as Dalry Junction, where the Kilmarnock line diverged.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, Campbell Highet, The Glasgow & South-Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965John Thomas, revised Alan J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6: Scotland, The Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbott, 1984, =Elderslie diveunder= Johnstone railways in 1906At Elderslie, westbound trains had either continued on the old main line via Howwood, or diverged to the right for Cart Junction and Greenock. The opening of the new line resulted in more trains for Dalry and beyond diverging to the right here, to take the Johnstone North line; in addition fast boat trains for Greenock were of increasing importance. These services conflicted with northbound trains and the main line, leading to delay. In 1906 the GS&WR; started construction of a burrowing junction at Elderslie, for the Cart Junction line. When the original main line was built, the Glasgow, Paisley and Johnstone Canal was crossed here by a bridge. The canal was long since defunct, but the bridge was on a suitable alignment, and the dive-under line was made so as to use it.Railway Times (periodical), volume 89, page 95 Passenger train service The line had about twelve return passenger journeys a day, running from Glasgow St Enoch to Ardrossan, Ayr, Kilmarnock and Largs.Stansfield, page 16 Closure A casualty of the Beeching Axe, the line closed to regular passenger traffic on 27 June 1966.Hurst, p. 44 The line later closed to all traffic from Cart Junction to Kilbirnie on 3 July 1972,Hurst, p. 67 with the line between Kilbirnie and Brownhill Junction remaining open until 19 December 1977,Hurst, p. 70 primarily to serve Glengarnock Steel Works.

Topography The branch line from Cart Junction to North Johnstone opened on 1 August 1896.

Products  Alter Eco produces a line of chocolate and chocolate-centric products. The company formerly sourced and sold coffee, tea, rice, olive oil and hearts of palm as part of their original push to spread fair trade products. The company has since changed to focus their products around chocolate and quinoa because of the better opportunities for a growing company to focus on one main supply versus a line of different goods. The company produces a line of chocolate bars and chocolate truffles that are organic, non-GMO, and fair trade, and some are vegan. The chocolate is manufactured in Switzerland. The chocolate bars come in 10 flavors such as Brown Butter, and Super Blackout, which is 90% cacao. The truffles come in five flavors: Classic Dark, Sea Salt, Salted Caramel, Mint Cr√®me, and Silk Velvet. In 2018, Alter Eco entered the snacking category with its Coconut Cluster products, available in Original, Seeds and Salt, and Cherry and Almond Butter. The products were launched at the 2018 Natural Products Expo and were one of VegNews magazine's best new vegan products.  Full circle sustainability  The company‚Äôs missions is to pioneer a full circle approach to eating, farming and doing business‚Äîand to inspire others to do the same. In 2016, the company began publishing a Social Impact Report. The company has a four pronged approach to sustainability: ;Choose clean ingredients: Alter Eco sources only organic and non-gmo products and works with its farmers to transition their cultivation to more sustainable and cleaner practices. The company places importance on traceability, and also removes or substitutes ingredients that are generally unsustainable or unhealthy. For example, the company uses coconut oil instead of palm oil in its products. The products are all organic certified and non-gmo verified. ;Invest in farmers: From the beginning, Alter Eco was driven by the need to support fair trade cooperatives and fair trade premiums that allow for their suppliers to invest in community needs, such as school programs or new farming equipment. 100% of their products are source directly from small-scale farmers and fair trade certified. The company works with four main cooperatives in Ecuador, Peru, India and Sri Lanka. ;Regenerate the Earth: Alter Eco supports a carbon insetting agroforestry program with PUR Projet that allows the company to offset all of its carbon emissions through reforestation activities with their co-ops in Peru. This reforestation project and other support from the company allow for their suppliers to enact dynamic agroforestry practices that improve the health of the soils and long-term health of the farms. Alter Eco joined One Step Closer to an Organic Sustainable Community (OSC2), a community of businesses mostly in the Northern California area that are driving sustainable impact in 2012. Alter Eco joined OSC2 in the creation of the Climate Collaborative to promote sustainability and climate change mitigative practices to private sector food companies. ;Eliminate waste: In 2016, Alter Eco created the first fully compostable laminated stand-up pouch, which it used for its line of quinoa products. The company partnered with Elk Packaging to create pouches made from birch and eucalyptus wood pulp, non-GMO corn, and printed with non-toxic ink. The pouches compost within three to six months. Prior to this, in 2014, the company created the first ever compostable candy wrapper for its chocolate truffles. The wrappers are made of eucalyptus and birch fibers, layered with a thin layer of aluminum, and printed with natural inks.

Proston is the historic Lake Boondooma township with a business district, residences and farms  Geography  The town is located north-west of the state capital, Brisbane northwest of the South Burnett regions commercial centre, Kingaroy and South of Lake Boondooma. It is the closest supporting township to Lake Boondooma and has a variety of shops including post office, grocery store (SPAR), pub (Golden Spurs), chemist, medical centre, hardware, cafe, and clothing store. The area around Proston is hilly, grassland, grazing country, most of it cleared from the original brigalow scrub that once covered the immediate vicinity. History leftThe town's name is taken from a pastoral run name, which in turn was a corruption of an Aboriginal word (possibly from the Waka language) meaning kurrajong tree. The town was founded in 1910 with a land ballot that attracted a group of settlers from England. With little access to water, early settlers struggled to maintain a living from the land. The coming of the railway in 1923Red Soil, Wattle and Crows Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, February 1976 pp21-39 eased some of the early hardships. The construction of the South Burnett Dairy Co- operative Butter Factory in 1934 led to even more growth. Proston Provisional School (also known as the Proston Construction Camp School) opened on 9 July 1917 to provide schooling for the children of the workers constructing the Proston railway line. It closed on 31 July 1918. Although named Proston, the school name reflects the name of the railway line than its actual location. It is believed the school may have been closer to present day Hivesville than present day Proston. The current Proston State School opened on 24 July 1924 as a primary school. In 1965 it expanded to include secondary education to Year 10. In 1977 it expanded to include a preschool. Shepherd Memorial Anglican Church of St Peter was dedicated on 3 March 1939 by the Most Reverend John William Charles Wand. In 1969 St George's Anglican Church was relocated from Tingoora to the Proston to serve as the St Peter's Church Hall. St George's had operated in Tingoora from 1921 to 1962. The hall is located behind the church on a different allotment. St Peter's closure in November 2015 was approved by Bishop Cameron Venables. The closure of the railway line and Butter Factory in the 1970s threw the area into a long period of slow decline. The creation of the nearby Boondooma Dam in the 1970s by damming the Boyne River provided a source of water for Tarong Power Station and solved Proston's water problems.

Most people who trade options are technical traders. It essentially means they look for patterns in charts. Also they use statistical correlations and deviations and give them Greek names like alpha, beta, delta, theta, gamma, vega, and rho. Few professional money managers use technical analysis and these tools are typically used by individual traders. Its counterpart, fundamental analysis, similarly uses some math to generate ratios, but the inputs and outputs are much more tangible (e.g. income, revenue, assets). Overview Options, particularly exchange- traded options, are highly volatile securities whose market prices can change rapidly. In addition, the number of options in a market can be large. For instance, as of December 2013, there were over 550,000 individual equity option contracts, written on nearly 6,100 underlying stocks and exchange- traded funds (ETFs), listed on the various U.S. options exchanges. Each contract is typically listed on multiple exchanges, resulting in millions of separate option prices that all change in real-time. Screening criteria Being able to isolate option plays that appeal to a specific trader is a vital component of a useful option screener. To do this, the option screener needs to allow the trader to define filters that narrow down the options based upon what the trader deems important. Typical filters include, but are not limited to: *option expiration *historic volatility *implied volatility *moneyness *open interest *option price *p/e ratio *probability *put/call ratio *share price *stock exchange *strike price *intrinsic value *premium *volume See also * Stock selection criterion References Category:Options (finance) Category:Derivatives (finance) ","title":"Option screener"},{"id":"7662148","text":"Tijan Jaiteh (born 31 December 1988) is a Gambian footballer for Al-Markhiya.

He also served on the first and third Special Councils which administered the province after the Lower Canada Rebellion. After the union of Upper and Lower Canada, he retired from politics. In 1839, Pothier was named sheriff for Montreal district, but served only five days. With Peter McGill, he was involved in the construction of the Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad, the first railway in the province.

The proposed westernmost of the three circles was detected on RAF aerial photographs from 1947; if a circle, it is much smaller in diameter than the other two and could possibly depict a hut circle instead.

The first mention of the stone circle in the modern times is found in the 1754 work Antiquities, historical and monumental, of the County of Cornwall by William Borlase, who reported 17 upright standing stones. An early drawing, by William Cotton in 1827, can be found in his book Illustrations of Stone Circles, Cromlehs and other remains of the Aboriginal Britons in the West of Cornwall. At that time some of the standing stones in the other stone circles were still visible.

It is one of 14 films made by Columbia Pictures involving detective Boston Blackie, a criminal-turned-crime solver. This was the sixth in the series and one of three that did not have his name in the title. The film is also William Castle's directorial debut. As with many of the films of the period, this was a flag waver to support America's efforts during World War II. Plot Boston Blackie (Chester Morris) helps get prisoners with needed skills released on parole to help in the machine and tool plant of his friend, Arthur Manleder (Lloyd Corrigan). Those chosen want to support America's war effort. All of the parolees have to stay in Blackie's apartment, all except robber Dooley Watson. Blackie allows him to see his wife and son. Watson goes after the payroll money he stole before he was captured. His wife Mary (Jeanne Bates) convinces him to give it back, but his partners in crime, \\"Red\\" Taggart (John Harmon) and \\"Nails\\" Blanton (Douglas Fowley), have been waiting patiently for their share. When they threaten Dooley's family, Dooley fights back. Red is killed in the ensuing struggle. Nails runs off. If Boston Blackie is to save his project, he has to capture Nails and force him to confess the death was in self-defense, all while dodging Inspector Farraday (Richard Lane).

He represented the Wallabies in over 20 Tests and tour matches from 1907 to 1909 and the Kangaroos in 5 Tests from 1910 to 1912. He is unique in Australian rugby history as the only man to captain both the national rugby union and rugby league teams. Following his playing career he became the most successful coach of North Sydney in the club's history. Chris McKivat Unique in history He captained the 1908 Summer Olympics gold medal winning Wallaby side and was the eighth captain of the Australian national rugby league team leading them in all 3 Tests of the 1911‚Äì12 tour. Thus he captained his country to victory on tour in two different rugby codes. 1908 Wallaby tour squad Rugby union career He was born in Cumnock, New South Wales and educated by the Patrician Brothers in Orange. He played country rugby union with the \\"Our Boys\\" club in Wellington and was regularly selected in country representative teams until he was 26. He was a tactically brilliant half-back and a great on-field leader of both forwards and backs. Affectionately known as the \\"hairy bloke\\",2005 Annual Report ‚Äì Australian Rugby League (p. 50) he moved to Sydney to join the Glebe Rugby Club in 1905 and played five-eighth for four seasons outside Fred Wood who would later be vice-captain of the 1908‚Äì09 Wallabies. McKivat was selected for New South Wales in 1905 to represent against the visiting All Blacks and then for the Wallabies in 1907 playing three Tests against the All Blacks. He was on the first Wallaby tour of the United Kingdom in 1908‚Äì09 and captained the side in 17 tour matches including the historic gold medal winning match against Cornwall representing England in the 1908 London Olympics. Rugby league career Glebe RLFC 1911 McKivat (centre with ball), flanked by Roy Algie left Frank Burge right. He crossed over to the professional code joining the Glebe Rugby League Club as a 29-year-old veteran in 1910. He made his rugby league international debut that same year in the first Test in Sydney on 18 June 1910 against Great Britain. Four of his former Wallaby teammates also debuted that day John Barnett, Bob Craig, Jack Hickey and Charles Russell ‚Äì making them collectively Australia's 11th to 15th dual code internationals. This repeated a similar occurrence two years earlier when five former Wallabies in Micky Dore, Dally Messenger, Denis Lutge, Doug McLean snr and John Rosewell all debuted for the Kangaroos in the first ever Test against New Zealand. The crowning achievement of his distinguished football career came on the 1911‚Äì12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain when he captained Australia in all three Tests against Great Britain for two wins and one draw to a series victory that would not be equalled for more than 50 years Australia's first Rugby League Ashes success was testament to his on-field genius and off-field leadership. He played in 31 matches on Tour (30 successive appearances) and scored 10 tries. The Heads/Middleton reference describes him a being revered on that tour ‚Äì a magnificent general, tough, durable and an inspiration to the men around him.

He appeared in opera, oratorio, musical comedy and song, from the First World War through to the late 1950s. He was renowned for his enunciation and diction. He became the most prolific radio broadcaster of his time. Biography He was born William Ewart Noble on 25 September 1898, in Bristol. His father's name was also William, so the younger William was known as Ewart Noble. He was trained at Bristol Cathedral's Choir School under its teacher, Dr. Hubert Hunt. He was invalided after war service in France with the Royal Bucks Hussars, but returned to the front to sing with the Fifth Army's entertainment unit, \\"The Gaieties\\". This provided him with his first stage appearance, in the opera house of Lille, in the musical Aladdin. It was around this time that he chose the professional name Dennis Noble, after seeing a Dennis lorry drive past.Charles A. Hooey, Dennis Noble (baritone) ‚Äì Music Web International In 1923 he married Marjorie Booth, a contralto. He studied singing with Dinh Gilly and Mattia Battistini. He was invited to join the choir of Westminster Abbey, and sang at the wedding of H.R.H. the Duke of York and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in April 1923. His voice was noticed by Percy Pitt while he was singing at a cinema, and he was invited to sing at Covent Garden, as Silvio in Pagliacci, after some very hurried lessons in stage craft from Aylmer Buesst. He then determined to one day sing Rigoletto at Covent Garden. In the meantime, he continued singing in musical comedy. In 1924 he joined Amelita Galli-Curci's tour of Britain. He added Rigoletto to his repertoire, as well as Papageno (The Magic Flute) and Prince Aphron (The Golden Cockerel).

He worked on the Quintet and two other major chamber piecesThe Violin Sonata in E minor, Op. 82 and the String Quartet in E minor, Op. 83. in the summer of 1918 while staying at Brinkwells near Fittleworth in Sussex. W. H. \\"Billy\\" Reed considered that all three were \\"influenced by the quiet and peaceful surroundings during that wonderful summer\\". The Quintet was first performed on 21 May 1919, by the pianist William Murdoch, the violinists Albert Sammons and W. H. Reed, the violist Raymond Jeremy and the cellist Felix Salmond. These players included some of the composer's musical confidantes ‚Äì Reed worked with him on the Violin Concerto and the Third Symphony, and Salmond worked on the Cello Concerto with him. Albert Sammons later made the first complete recording of the Violin Concerto. The work is dedicated to Ernest Newman, music critic of The Manchester Guardian. Movements There are three movements: #Moderato ‚Äì Allegro #Adagio #Andante ‚Äì Allegro In performance, the first movement takes about 14 minutes, the adagio a little under 12, and the last movement a little over 10, making this the longest of Elgar‚Äôs chamber works. His wife's first reaction on hearing the three chamber works was 'E. writing wonderful new music', and more than fifty years later The Gramophone agreed: 'Alice Elgar was quite right: it is a new urgency, pointed and refined by the discipline of writing chamber music, a discipline that clearly rejuvenated Elgar's imagination. It is big chamber music, with at times an almost orchestral sonority to it...' The Quintet was first recorded by Ethel Hobday with the Spencer Dyke Quartet for the National Gramophonic Society in December 1925. Compton Mackenzie suggested that Elgar himself should play the piano for the recording, but the composer refused the invitation replying, \\"I never play the pianoforte - I scramble through things orchestrally in a way that would madden with envy all existing pianists\\". It was subsequently recorded electrically for HMV by Harriet Cohen and the Stratton Quartet at the beginning of October 1933, immediately before the composer became seriously ill. Test pressings were rushed to Elgar's bedside; the pleasure he gained from them inspired Fred Gaisberg to record the Quintet as a Christmas present to the ailing composer. The work took some years to establish itself in the repertoire, but in recent years it has been performed and recorded many times. Other Versions *An orchestration of the Piano Quintet was completed by Donald Fraser in 2015. Its first recording, a performance by the English Symphony Orchestra conducted by Kenneth Woods, was released in May 2016. It received its first performance by the ESO and Woods at the 2015 Elgar Pilgrimage in Elgar Concert Hall at the University of Birmingham in October 2015. Christopher Morley, the long-time senior critic of the Birmingham Post recognised the historical significance of the premiere, saying of the occasion that it was \\"one of the two most exciting events I have experienced during a reviewing career approaching half a century. October‚Äôs performance under Kenneth Woods in the appropriately named Elgar Concert Hall at Birmingham University was a revelation‚Ä¶ This triumph of transcription deserves to be heard worldwide.\\" The performance was later hailed as a 2015 Premiere of the Year in Classical Music Magazine. Musicologist Stephen Johnson, writing for BBC Music Magazine, said of the arrangement that \\" Fraser hasn‚Äôt just translated Elgar‚Äôs notes into rich and powerful orchestral terms, he has added (discreetly it must be said) the kinds of touches of colour and splashes of figuration Elgar himself might well have introduced. It really sounds like Elgar‚Ä¶ beautifully realised, performed with warmth and understanding, and sympathetically recorded.\\" Andrew Clements wrote in The Guardian that ‚ÄúFraser‚Äôs work on the quintet does genuinely seem to give the music another dimension‚Ä¶ As scored by Fraser, certain passages, such as the second subject in the opening movement, immediately connect with the world of the symphonies and the symphonic poem Falstaff‚Ä¶ Kenneth Woods‚Äôs performance with the English Symphony Orchestra certainly shows that it is a plausible orchestral work.‚Äù  Recordings  *In 2003, the BBC Radio 3 ‚ÄòBuilding a Library‚Äô feature recommended a recording by the Sorrel Quartet (Gina McCormack, Catherine Yates, Sarah-Jane Bradley and Helen Thatcher) and Ian Brown on the Chandos label. *Older recordings include, from the 78 era, the Stratton Quartet/Harriet Cohen version mentioned above, and from the LP years, John Ogdon and the Allegri Quartet, reissued on CD by Dutton and EMI respectively. A recording made c. 1963 for Delta Records by the Aeolian Quartet, successor of the Stratton Quartet, includes Watson Forbes (viola) (with Leonard Cassini, piano), a member of the Strattons in the 1933 recording, so that there is a continuity of tradition in this performance. *Donald Fraser's orchestration of the Quintet was recorded in Elgar Concert Hall, Birmingham on 9 October 2015 and released in 2016 by Avie Records as AV2362. The performers were Kenneth Woods, conductor and the English Symphony Orchestra. The recording was a Classic FM Recording of the Month in May 2016 and spent eight weeks in the UK Classical Charts.

Behind her, an ox cart, and in the distance, the village \\"Maud Muller\\" is a poem from 1856 written by John Greenleaf Whittier (1807‚Äì1892). It is about a beautiful maid named Maud Muller. One day, while harvesting hay, she meets a judge from the local town. Each is smitten with the other. The judge thinks that he would like to be a local farmer married to Maud, while she thinks that she would like to be the wealthy judge's wife. Neither voices these thoughts, however, and both the judge and the maiden move on. The judge marries a woman of wealth whose love for him is based on his riches. Maud Muller marries a young uneducated farmer. Throughout the rest of their lives, each remembers the day of their meeting and remorsefully reflects on what might have been. This poem contains the well-known quotation: \\"For of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: 'It might have been!'\\" Whittier's younger contemporary Bret Harte wrote a short parody and sequel to the poem entitled \\"Mrs. Judge Jenkins\\", which mocks Whittier's conclusion by having Maud marry the Judge after all, with far more disastrous results: Maud's relatives get drunk in the wedding, while Maud herself grows \\"broad and red and stout\\" after giving birth to twins. Both eventually come to regret the marriage: Maud because she finds the Judge's emphasis on knowledge boring, while the Judge bemoans Maud's lack of refinement and social grace.

Career  Batan began his career at Assyriska F√∂reningen. He made his first appearance in the first-team squad in Superettan during the 2003 season. Assyriska was promoted to Allsvenskan in 2004, and Batan made his Allsvenskan debut against Hammarby IF on 11 April 2005. After the 2005 season, Batan received several offers from a number of clubs and was involved in some controversy on leaving Assyriska. AIK had announced to media that Batan had signed for them, claiming they had an oral agreement, but had to see themselves fooled as he signed for their archrivals Djurg√•rdens IF only a few days later. Batan claimed it was a childhood dream to play for Djurg√•rden, whereas fans of AIK found his \\"treachery\\" very hard to accept. On the pitch, Batan had a tough job making himself a regular starter for Djurg√•rden and he was regularly a substitute for the team. During the summer 2008, he was put on loan for Assyriska F√∂reningen due to lack of time on the pitch. He was also loaned out to Assyriska FF for the 2009 season. He left Djurg√•rden when his contract expired after the 2009 season. He returned to Assyriska in 2010 where he acted as a regular starter for the club in the Swedish second tier Superettan. During the upcoming three seasons he played a total of 105 games for the club, scoring on 3 occasions. When his contract expired after the 2013 season, he signed a three year-deal with Hammarby Fotboll, a fierce rival of his former club Djurg√•rden. In the 2014 Superettan he played 27 league games for Hammarby as his side regained promotion to Allsvenskan. In the upcoming two seasons, back in the Swedish first tier, Batan was used more sparingly as a starter. However, in December 2016 he renewed his link to the club signing a new one year-deal. He only appeared in three league games in 2017, and left the club at the end of the season at the expiration of his contract. On 26 January 2018, Batan returned to Assyriska FF, now competing in Division 1, the Swedish third tier.

He acted in a number of high- profile films as well as B movies from the 1940s through the 1960s, and he is best known for his supporting performances as Gus Esmond, wealthy fianc√© of Lorelei Lee (Marilyn Monroe) in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), and as the musician Danny McGuire in A Star Is Born (1954). He played a stockroom worker in the film Bundle of Joy (1956) with Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Early years Born in Bellingham, Washington, Noonan was the younger half- brother of actor John Ireland. Noonan was the son of Michael James Noone and Gracie Ferguson. His father was a vaudeville comedian and a native of Galway County, Ireland. His mother, a piano teacher, was from Glasgow, Scotland. He attended New York University.  Career  In 1934, Noonan and Ireland made their stage debuts with a New York-based experimental theater. They later appeared together in three films, including I Shot Jesse James (1949). Noonan had a repertory company of his own prior to World War II. On Broadway, Noonan appeared in How to Make a Man (1960) and Men to the Sea (1944). After serving in the U.S. Navy, Noonan made his film debut in George White's Scandals (1945). He teamed with Peter Marshall to form a comedy team in the late 1940s. The team's performances were limited because they continued their individual careers, \\"working together only when both were available at the same time\\". Working as Noonan and Marshall, they appeared on television, nightclubs, and in the films Starlift (1951), FBI Girl (1951) (in a brief appearance), The Rookie (1959), and Swingin' Along (1962). The duo went their separate ways after the release of Swingin' Along. In 1953, Noonan appeared in the classic musical movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes as Gus Esmond, the nerdy fianc√© of Marilyn Monroe's character Lorelei Lee. In 1955, he played a voyeuristic bank manager in the Richard Fleischer Film Noir Melodrama, Violent Saturday. In 1961, Noonan appeared on the CBS courtroom drama Perry Mason as the defendant and episode's title character, comedian Charlie Hatch, in \\"The Case of the Crying Comedian.\\" In the early 1960s, Noonan appeared in a few B movies, including Promises! Promises! (1963) with Jayne Mansfield and 3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt (1964) with Mamie Van Doren, which he also directed, wrote and produced. His last effort as a producer was Cottonpickin' Chickenpickers (1967), which was also Sonny Tufts' last movie.  Personal life  Noonan was married five times. His last wife was actress Carole Langley whose stage name was Pocahontas Crowfoot. They were married 16 years and had four children. Noonan also had a daughter from his first marriage and son from his second marriage.  Death  Eight months after an operation for a brain tumor, Noonan died at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital, just a few days shy of his 47th birthday.

It had a covered walkway out into Elderslie Main Road. It was a busy railway intersection, as all mainline traffic from Glasgow - Ayr/Stranraer passed through it, as well as the Paisley Canal Line, the Dalry and North Johnstone Line, and the Bridge of Weir Railway.'Lost railway lines south of Glasgow' - A.

It ends about northeast of Harrisburg at the Appalachian Trail.Backpacking Pennsylvania: 37 Great Hikes, Mitchell, Stackpole Books, 2004, The trail was developed for equestrian and pedestrian use, according to the Horse-Shoe Trail Club guide (see below), hence the name (horse + shoe). A 17-mile segment of the trail in Chester and Berks counties has been designated a National Recreation Trail.  Trail junctions  The east end of the Horse-Shoe Trail is at the boundary of Montgomery County and Chester County in Valley Forge National Historical Park. The trail connects with other trails in the park, which can be followed to connect with the long-distance Schuylkill River Trail at the northeast corner of the park, although the unsigned route includes three crossings of busy PA Route 23. West of Valley Forge Park, the original trail has been broken up by suburban development. Some segments of the original trail have been closed off by new housing and lengthy detours are now required to continue on the trail's route. Detours and rerouted portions are sometimes not marked clearly. Further west in Chester County, the trail meets the northern terminus of the Brandywine Trail, a limited-access trail that runs south roughly along Brandywine Creek to Brandywine Creek State Park near Wilmington, Delaware. In Berks County the trail crosses several short trails within the French Creek State Park trail system. In Lancaster County, the trail meets the northern terminus of the Conestoga Trail, which goes south through the county to eventually meet the Mason-Dixon Trail. In Lebanon County, the trail crosses the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail. In Dauphin County, after crossing fields and following roads in the Hershey area, the trail crosses Appalachian ridges and valleys in one of its most remote and strenuous sections, before ending at the Appalachian Trail atop Stony Mountain. Nearby trails *Struble Trail (Downingtown, Pennsylvania) Points of interest * Near the eastern end of the trail are the ruins of an old root beer bottling plant. A spring runs through the ruins. * The trail traverses the Hopewell Big Woods in western Chester County and eastern Berks County. This area includes Welkinweir, an arboretum and conservation area south of Pottstown. Further west in this area is the National Recreation Trail segment, which goes through Warwick County Park, Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, and French Creek State Park. * Further west the trail goes up and down the Furnace Hills. Midway through this section, in Lancaster County, is Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area. * Many of the wooded areas on the trail are in Pennsylvania State Game Lands. Trail users should wear appropriate reflective clothing during hunting seasons, and there may be trail closures or detours in some of those seasons.  Horse-Shoe Trail Club  The Horse-Shoe Trail Club was founded in 1935 and coordinates volunteer and funding efforts to maintain the trail. The club prints a guide to the trail that is updated occasionally, which includes a booklet and a set of 10 detailed maps (Maps updated in 2018). The guide is available for sale through the club. It is also sold at the visitor's center to Valley Forge Park and other select locations. The 24th edition of the guide was published in February 2011. There is also a newsletter, Blaze, that is published and includes updated information to the guide.

At , it is the highest peak in the Albula Alps and the municipality of Berg√ºn, Grisons. The first ascent was made 1846 by J. Coaz, J. Rascher, C. Casper and J. Tscharner. Geography Piz Kesch is part of the mountain ridge which divides the southeastern Swiss Alps between the Rhine drainage basin (North Sea) and the Danube drainage basin (Black Sea). It is also the highest peak in the Eastern Alps north of the Inn River. On the north side lies the Porchabella Glacier. The peak rising above the Porchabella Glacier West of Piz Kesch lies the Albula Pass (Pass d'Alvra in Rumantsch); to the north lies the valley of Davos, and to the south lies the Upper Engadine. On the foot of Piz Kesch in the Engadine lies the village of Madulain (1,694 m). Two SAC's alpine huts lie close to Piz Kesch which are the Chamanna d'Es-Cha or Es-Cha H√ºtte (ca 2,594 m), and the Kesch-H√ºtte or Chamanna digl Kesch at (ca 2,625 m). The first lies on a 3-hour walk from Madulain, La Punt and Zuoz and about 1¬Ω hours from the Albula Pass road. Kesch-H√ºtte lies 4¬Ω hours from Berg√ºn and can be reached as well from the Davos southern valleys of Sertig and Dischma or by a longer walk via Val Susauna coming from Cinuos-chel. Climbing history View from the Val d'Es- cha (south-east side) The tower-like peak of Piz Kesch was reached for the first time on September 7, 1846, by Chr. Casper, Johann Coaz, J. Rascher, J.R. Tscharner.Alpengipfel und Erstersteiger erstersteiger.de. Retrieved 2010-02-12 In 1864 the ascent was repeated by Francis Fox Tuckett and Fowler, with guides C. Michel and M. Payot. From the Platzli huts, located above Berg√ºn, they reached in 3 hours a pass (3,008 m) on the ridge above the Vadret da Porchabella, overlooking the head of the Es-cha valley on the east. From this ‚Äî called Porta d'Es-cha ‚Äî they finally reached the peak in less than 2 hours. They afterwards descended in 3 hours from the pass to La Punt on the east side of the mountain. According to Tuckett, they were the first to reach the highest summit:Alpine Club (London),The Alpine journal, Volume 1, p. 381 :\\"...we reached the summit of Piz Kesch without the slightest difficulty in 1 hour 10 m. (45 m. over snow and 25 m. up very steep but good rocks). On a second summit to the SE., which a level showed to be slightly lower than where we stood, was planted a baton; but on our peak were no traces of any previous visit. M. Coaz, I was told, had ascended Piz Kesch a few years ago, so that probably he climbed the second peak by mistake.\\"  Hiking  A network of marked mountain paths leads to the southern, western and northern face of Piz Kesch whereas the eastern face is covered with a glacier and connected with the rest of this massif thus not accessible on hiking trails.

Synopsis Emily dreams of the morning of her wedding to Roger, then awakens and realizes that Roger is most likely dead. Meanwhile, outside of town, the Ravenwood mercenaries, led by Goetz, show up at the Richmond farm and steal gas for their two black Hummers. Stanley confronts them, and Goetz asks if he knows Eric. Stanley tells him he \\"can't help them\\", and then Goetz rounds up his men and leaves. Stanley heads over to the Green house to warn Jake and Eric about them. Anticipating the mercenaries' arrival, Gray, Jake, and Hawkins arrange an armed checkpoint, using inoperative cars to block the bridge leading out of Jericho in the direction of Rogue River. Soon the mercenaries arrive, and a confrontation takes place. A minor firefight erupts when a town citizen nervously fires off a shot. Although no one is hurt, Goetz gives an ultimatum: Clear the bridge in four hours, or the Ravenwood men will force their way through. Eric causes a rift with his mother when he reveals to April his feelings for Mary. His mother tells April that she is welcome to stay with their family for as long as she likes--before Eric says that he will not be coming home. He is still unaware that April is pregnant. Jake comes to Emily in her last daydream of the episode. He repeats what Roger said in a previous daydream, telling her she knows why she can't leave Jericho, and for a moment, it looks like they are about to kiss.

He is also the first person to cross North America on inline skates (1996), and the first to cross the Pacific Ocean by pedal power (2000). Together with Stevie Smith, Lewis completed the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean from mainland Europe to North America by human power (1995). Expedition 360 Lewis pedalling his boat Moksha on the River Thames in London, shortly before completing the first human-powered circumnavigation of the Earth (2007) Lewis set off with friend and fellow adventurer Stevie Smith from Greenwich, London on 12 July 1994, to complete the world's first human-powered circumnavigation, and the two dubbed the journey Expedition 360. By July 2007, Lewis had travelled over . He successfully ended his 4,833-day expedition on 6 October 2007, having travelled . In mid-1994, Lewis and Smith mountain-biked 1,700 miles through France, Spain and Portugal to the port of Lagos, Portugal. Departing on 13 October 1994, Lewis and Smith then pedaled 111 consecutive days and 4,500 miles across the Atlantic Ocean from Portugal to Miami, Florida in a wooden pedal-powered boat named Moksha. Lewis then rollerbladed thousands of miles across North America. He was struck by a drunk driver in Pueblo, Colorado, and spent nine months recovering from two broken legs. He finished the North American expedition leg in 1996. In 1998 and 1999, Lewis and Smith spent 53 days pedaling Moksha across the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco, California to Hilo, Hawaii, where Smith ended his journey. In four days, Lewis and a small group of supporters hiked the 80 miles across Hawaii. After 73 days of solo pedaling Moksha across the doldrums, Lewis completed the Pacific Ocean crossing from Hawaii to the island atoll of Tarawa. In May 2000, he was accompanied by Moksha's builder, Chris Tipper, to pedal the 1,300-mile stretch from Tarawa to the Solomon Islands. With the help of friend and expedition supporter April Abril, Lewis then pedaled Moksha 1,450 miles for 32 days across the Coral Sea to Australia. In 2001, Lewis and a group of supporters spent 88 days cycling 3,500 miles across the Australian outback, starting near Cooktown, Queensland, and finishing in the port city of Darwin, Northern Territory. After spending many years raising funds to continue Expedition 360, Lewis was reunited with Moksha in 2005. He and expedition supporter Lourdes Arango pedaled 450 nautical miles from Darwin to Dili, East Timor. Throughout 2005, Lewis kayaked thousands of miles through the Indonesian archipelago from East Timor to Singapore. In 2006, he biked from Singapore to the Himalayas, and biked and hiked through the Himalayas to the port of Mumbai. Covering 2,000 nautical miles in 46 days during early 2007, Lewis and friend Sher Dhillon pedaled Moksha from Mumbai, India, crossing the Arabian Sea to Djibouti. Lewis then planned to travel through Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt, and the Middle East before reaching Europe ‚Äì encountering a problem in Sudan. The Egyptian authorities would not let him pass through their waters, and when his visa for Sudan ran out he was left with an \\"impossible decision\\". He attempted to kayak across Lake Nasser to Abu Simbel but was arrested on suspicion of spying. He was released, but Egyptian authorities forbade him from cycling the 178-mile journey to Aswan. He completed this section illegally by riding partly at night.http://www.expedition360.com/journal/archives/2007/06/the_last_of_the.html During his journey through Sudan he encountered actors Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman who were travelling south as part of their Long Way Down motorbike trip. In July 2007, Lewis reached Syria, and then cycled across Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Germany, and Belgium before returning to London on 6 October. Pulling Moksha in tow, Lewis crossed the Greenwich Meridian Line where he had begun his expedition 13 years earlier. During his expedition, Lewis twice survived malaria, sepsis, a bout of mild schizophrenia, and a crocodile attack near Australia in 2005. As part of a wider interest in sustainability and education, Lewis has visited more than 900 schools in 37 countries, giving talks to students and involving them in a variety of programs to promote world citizenship, zero carbon emission travel, and awareness of consumption habits on the health of the planet.

Trillium has a telecommunications orientation and provides customer focus. The practices in the Trillium Model are derived from a benchmarking exercise which focused on all practices that would contribute to an organization's product development and support capability. The Trillium Model covers all aspects of the software development life-cycle, most system and product development and support activities, and a significant number of related marketing activities. Many of the practices described in the model can be applied directly to hardware development.  Objectives  The Trillium Model has been developed from a customer perspective, as perceived in a competitive, commercial environment. The Model is used in a variety of ways: * In benchmarking an organization's product development and support process capability against best practices in the industry, * In self-assessment mode, to help identify opportunities for improvement within a product development organization, and * In pre-contractual negotiations, to assist in selecting a supplier. This Model and its accompanying tools are not in themselves a product development process or life-cycle model. Rather, the Trillium Model provides key industry best practices which can be used to improve an existing process or life-cycle  Scale  The Trillium scale spans levels 1 through 5. Levels can be characterized in the following way: # Unstructured: The development process is ad hoc. Projects often cannot meet quality or schedule targets. Success, while possible, is based on individuals rather than on organizational infrastructure. (Risk ‚Äì High) # Repeatable and Project Oriented: Individual project success is achieved through strong project management planning and control, with emphasis on requirements management, estimation techniques, and configuration management. (Risk ‚Äì Medium) # Defined and Process Oriented: Processes are defined and used at the organizational level, although project customization is still permitted. Processes are controlled and improved. ISO 9001 requirements such as training and internal process auditing are incorporated. (Risk ‚Äì Low) # Managed and Integrated: Process instrumentation and analysis is used as a key mechanism for process improvement. Process change management and defect prevention programs are integrated into processes. CASE tools are integrated into processes. (Risk ‚Äì Lower) # Fully Integrated: Formal methodologies are extensively used. Organizational repositories for development history and process are used and effective. (Risk ‚Äì Lowest)  Architecture  The Trillium Model consists of Capability Areas, Roadmaps and Practices. There are four different ways in which the Trillium Model is typically applied. The Capability Evaluation and Capability Joint-Assessment are two methods of evaluating an organization's product development and support process capability. A Capability Evaluation is the evaluation of a supplier by a second party, typically the customer. A Capability Joint Evaluation assumes an effective partnership relationship exists between the customer and supplier.  Benefits  For Customer organizations, a higher capability means that: * the development organization is more responsive to customer and market demands, * the life-cycle cost of the product(s) is minimized, and * end-user satisfaction is maximized. For the Development organization, achieving a higher capability can result in: * lower development and maintenance costs, * shorter cycle time and development intervals, * an increased ability to achieve content and schedule commitments due to effective project risk analysis and effort estimation, and * an increasing ability to meet quantifiable design and quality objectives at all stages of the development process  Comparison with CMM  The Trillium Model covers all aspects of the software development life-cycle, most system and product development and support activities, and a significant number of related marketing activities. Although Trillium has been designed to be applied to embedded software systems such as telecommunications systems, much of the model can be applied to other segments of the software industry such as management information systems (MIS). The various differences between the Trillium Model and the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) as given as follow: # Trillium architecture is based on roadmaps, rather than key process areas (KPAs) present in CMM # Trillium has a wider product perspective rather than only based on software process improvement # Trillium claims a wider coverage of capability impacting issues. # Trillium has orientation towards customer focus, technological maturity and telecommunication industry.

The original line-up consisted of the members of Muckram Wakes (Roger Watson, Helen Watson, John Adams and Suzie Adams), Pete and Chris Coe, and Ian and Linda Wordsworth. There were several bands during the '70s looking for a different approach to playing country dance tunes and dancing than was current in the English Folk Dance and Song Society dances. Going back to listen to traditional musicians like Bob Cann and Scan Tester was a good start. Remembering that these were social dances, not a precious art form, gave licence to all sorts of creative cavorting. Of these new bands, Old Swan Band, Flowers and Frolics, Umps and Dumps, Pump and Pluck seemed to concentrate more on Southern English styles and repertoire. The New Victory Band developed a more Northerly aspect, listening to recordings of George Tremain, Ned Pearson, Adam Gray, Willie Taylor & Will Atkinson. The New Victory Band recorded just one album, One More Dance & Then, for Topic Records in 1978. It was re-released on CD by Backshift Records in 2000 and included six extra tracks recorded live on a continental tour towards the end of the band's existence. During the life of the band, drummer Ian Wordsworth was replaced by Pierce Butler and additional members included Mel Dean on concertina and Peadar Long on sax. The original instrumental line up was: *Pete Coe - Melodeon *Chris Coe - Hammered Dulcimer *John Adams - Trombone, fiddle, melodeon, harmonium, banjo *Suzie Adams - banjo *Roger Watson - tuba, banjo, mouth organ *Helen Watson - harmonium, piano, whistle *Ian Wordsworth - drums *Linda Wordsworth - tap dancing Note The original Victory Band was actually several bands who recorded 7-inch 78s for Woolworths between 1928 and 1931. They sold for sixpence and the recording quality was dire, even though the musicians were distinguished (one band included Mantovani).

Life He was born in Douglas, South Lanarkshire, Scotland on 13 August 1667. He died on 4 May 1747 at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland. The Dictionary of National Biography suggests that Hadow was educated abroad, probably due to the persecution of the Covenanters. It is probable that he was the same James Hadow who published two Latin theses in Utrecht in 1685 and 1686. He was placed as \\"second charge\\" of Cupar in Fife in 1692 and on 30 October 1694 was ordained as minister of Cupar. In 1699 he was made Professor of Divinity at St. Mary's College in the University of St. Andrews. Between 1707 and 1747 he was also Principal of the college. The head of the University of St Andrews is the Rector, who was elected annually, and Hadow was elected Rector on 14 occasions between 1706 and 1747. He died in St Andrews on 4 May 1747. Family In 1697 he married Isabel Tullidelph (d.1758) daughter of William Tullidelph, Principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews. His son George Hadow became professor of Hebrew in St Mary's College, University of St Andrews. His daughter Barbara Hadow married Rev Thomas Ayton minister of Kilconquhar. Hadow had a brother, Thomas Hadow. He is believed to have received a commission in the Cameronians in 1694, to have taken part in the Battle of Dunkeld in 1689 and was probably killed at the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692. In 1705 he married Margaret Forrester.  Work  Hadow was involved in many public controversies in the church. In 1720, he took a leading part in the Marrow controversy which bore on the views contained in The Marrow of Modern Divinity, published in England by Edward Fisher in 1645. In 1720, Hadow presided over a sub-committee for preserving purity of doctrine. Six so-called antinomian paradoxes were extracted from the work, on the subject of the sins of a believer.

This had led to a bitter feud between people on both sides that lasted for over a century. The issue is still debated by scholars. Odia view Ancient stone idol of Jayadeba at Akhandaleswara Temple, Prataparudrapura, Odisha Protagonists of the Odia viewpoint point out that all of Jayadeva's composition took place when the poet was in Puri, supporting the idea that he must have lived in Puri for most, if not all of his life. Archaeological discoveries in Odisha establish Jayadeva's extended presence in Odisha. There also exists a village called Kenduli Sasan in Odisha where the Hindu deity Krishna, who was also the main theme in Jayadeva's works, has traditionally been worshipped as the main god. Coincidentally, the inhabitants of that village also worship Jayadeva. A Sasan is a name for villages that traditionally were centers of Brahmin scholarly activity in Odisha, and Jayadeva himself was a Brahmin. Furthermore, researchers opine that Jayadeva is among the central-most figures in Odia culture. Jayadeva's works, they observe, have spread to southern India, but are rare in neighboring Bengal. It has been pointed out that the Gita Govinda's influence outside Odisha is most felt in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where verses of the poet's work have been incorporated into the Kuchipudi, Kathakali and Bharatanatyam classical dance forms respectively. It is Jayadeva's ashtapadis that are sung in dance performances of Odissi, the classical dance of Odisha. Odia bhajans (devotional songs) and traditional Odissi Music are based on ragas and talas specified by Jayadeva's hymns. Jayadeva was a devotee of Krishna, and Krishna in the form of Jagannath is the central deity of Odisha, whereas the female deity Durga is prominent in Bengal. The Gita Govinda composed by Jayadeva is one of the popular themes in the traditional patachitra paintings of Odisha. In stark contrast, according to Thomas Donaldson, an American specialist on Indian art history, Jayadeva's ragas do not match the lyrical patterns of Bengal, which unlike Odisha, does not even possess a classical vocal tradition. The lack of correlation between Bengali traditional music and the compositions of Jayadeva were independently observed in Barbara Stoler Miller's book, Love Song of the Dark Lord. Additionally, a highly Sanskritized and sophisticated classical culture had been firmly entrenched in Odisha during that period, while neighboring Bengal only had a folk based culture until recent times. =Archaeological evidence= Supporters of Odisha as his birthplace, including the Odisha state government, argue that the archaeological records, including temple inscriptions, palm manuscripts and lithographs of that era have revealed the poet's Odia origin. The worship of the Hindu deity, Krishna, in the form of Jagannath was widespread in Odisha during Jayadeva's birth. On the other hand, they argue that there is no archaeological evidence of such worship in Bengal until the arrival of Chaitanya, which was over three centuries after the era of Jayadeva. Inscription at the Lingaraj temple in Bhubaneswar tells us that Jayadeva had been a member of the teaching faculty of the school at Srikurmapataka, near Puri in Odisha. The inscriptions, that refer to \\"Sadhu Pradhana Jayadeva\\" were carved by the Odisha monarch of that period. Later discoveries of inscriptions at the Madhukeswar and Simhachal temples, also in Odisha, are believed to establish the linkage between Jayadeva and the dancing families of Kurmapataka, who held sway during the reign of the Odishian monarch Chodagangadeva. =Evidence based on medieval manuscripts= Furthermore, scholars maintain that accounts by numerous medieval authors, such as Chandra Dutta of Mithila and Navaji of Gwalior supports Odisha as the poet's birthplace. The poet Mahipati of Maharashtra writes in his book Bhakti Bijaya, that Jayadeva's native village was very close to Puri. The Assamese text, Sampradaya Kula Dipak as well as the Telugu text, Sanskruta Kabi Jivani, contain elaborate descriptions of the poet's birth taking place near the Jagannath Dham in Utkala (Odisha). Another book, Vaishnava Leelamruta by Madhaba Patnaik who lived in the sixteenth century and was contemporaneous to Chaitanya, clearly mentions that the poet was born near Puri. Some further details about Jayadeva have been garnered from Madhaba Patnaik's book. It gives a clear account of Chaitanya's visit to Puri. He mentions that Chaitanya paid a visit to Kenduli Sasan near Puri to pay homage to Jayadeva and to chant passages from the Gita Govinda. The book mentions that Kenduli Sasan was in fact the birthplace of the illustrious poet. Madhava Patnaik's book also gives an account of Jayadeva's early life from the legends around Puri. It mentions Jayadeva as excelling in the Shastras and the Puranas (sacred Hindu texts) from early childhood. = Evidence from Jayadeva's own writings = Historians now suggest that some of the poet's own compositions in Odia unequivocally support the idea that Jayadeva belonged to Puri, Odisha. Jayadeva mentions his birthplace as \\"Kendubilva by the sea\\" (\\"Kendubilva Samudra Sambhava\\") in his 7th Ashtapadi, and Birbhum, unlike Puri, does not abut on the sea. Jayadeva used to bathe each morning in the banks of a river, mentions the book Bhaktamala. A. K. Tripathy, an eminent scholar on Jayadeva, and P. C. Tripathy point out that the poet could never have walked daily to the river Ajeya which is 36 miles away from the Bengali village, unlike the Prachi river upon whose banks is situated the Kenduli village near Puri. Jayadeva's hymns refer to the ocean using the Sanskrit word \\"Mahodadhi\\", which is a typical name given to the sea in Puri. None of Jayadeva's compositions remotely suggest that he ever served in the court of any monarch. Besides, Lakshman Sena ruled Birbhum between 1179 AD and 1185 AD, that was about a century after the birth of Jayadeva. The Bengali view A few earlier accounts by Bengali writers had linked Jayadeva to the famous king of Bengal Lakshman Sen, the fourth ruler of the Sena dynasty and the last Hindu ruler of unified Bengal. These views originated from a single Bengali book, Jayadeva Charita authored by Odia poet called Banamali Das, then subsequently disseminated by Bengali historians. The book was written in 1803 when little was known about the poet's life. Since this was the only published source of information then, it eventually came to be accepted that Jayadeva may have been born in Bengal. This idea was further propagated in 1906 through an article by a certain M. M. Chakrobarty where he mentioned that the great poet belonged to Bengal in the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Since Jayadeva mentions the village of Kendubilva as his birthplace, a location in Birbhum, where a traditional Baul festival is held each year, was identified to have been the original Kenduli village of Jayadeva. Under the assumption that the illustrious poet was born there, that festival too became associated with Jayadeva. A nearby village acquired the sobriquet of \\"Jayadeva Kenduli\\" and became a tourist attraction, and the Baul festival was renamed as \\"Jayadeva Mela\\" Jayadeva lived for a long time in Navadwip during the reign of the king of Bengal, Lakshman Sen, making his home not far from the king's palace. At that time, the king's chief scholar was Govardhan Acharya. According to Ashutosh Deb's Bengali dictionary, Jayadeva was Lakshman Sen's court poet. Shrila Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes in his Navadvipa-dhama-mahatmya that Lakshman Sen was delighted when he heard Jayadeva's hymn to the ten incarnations, the Dasavatara-stotra. When Govardhan Acharya notified the king that it was Jayadeva who had composed the hymn, he became desirous to meet the poet. He went incognito to Jayadeva's house and when he saw him, he noticed that Jayadeva possessed all the characteristics of a great and powerful spiritual personality. In spite of having originated centuries later during the time of Chaitanya. Also The Krishna worshipping was prevailing in Bengal from long time before Sri Chaitanya.In the Gaudiya Vaishnava Abhidhana, it is stated that Jayadeva found his Radha Madhava Deities in this river's waters. It is also stated there that he used to rest and worship at the Temple of Shiva known as Kusheshwar, which is also on the banks of the Ajaya River. Since Jayadeva's composition, including the Gita Govinda clearly were composed in Puri in Odisha, Bengali historians who supported the idea that Jayadeva must have been from that state, went on to explain that the poet eventually settled in Puri in that state where he began composing poetry. Sikh encyclopedist Kahn Singh Nabha writes in his Encyclopedia Mahan Kosh (1926) that Jayadev was born in Kendooli, dist. beerbhumi Bengal. The Kaun Banega Crorepati faux pas The April 16, 2007 episode of the popular Indian TV game show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC III) mentioned Jayadeva as the court poet of king Lakshmanasena of Bengal. This triggered an immediate volley of protests by the culture-aware people of Odisha. Shah Rukh Khan, the game show's host was denounced for spreading false information. The government of Odisha has also demanded an apology from Kaun Banega Crorepati as it claims that the game show \\"mutilated historical facts\\" and \\"hurt the feelings of the people of Odisha\\". The Jayadeva Foundation Trust launched a protest against the TV show. Some scholars have expressed concern over the false depiction of Jayadeva's origin by Kaun Banega Crorepati, which they call a \\"historical humbug\\". Postage stamps commemorating Jayadeva's birth in Odisha In July 2009, the government of India's Department of Posts has decided to release 11 stamps in Bhubaneswar to commemorate the birth of Jayadeva. One stamp depicts the poet himself, while the other ten show the 10 incarnations of Vishnu, or Dasavatara, that the poet popularized in his epic poem, the Gita Govinda. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik unveiled the stamps at a special function in Jayadev Bhawan. The stamps are in the denomination of Rs 5. A total of 800,000 stamps were released for sale in Odisha.

She was the first Australian woman to parachute from an aeroplane over Australia and held the title of being the youngest female pilot in Australia for 15 years. Early life Burns was born at Rathdowne Street in the inner Melbourne suburb of East Brunswick. Her father was a merchant seaman. She attended MacRobertson Girls' High School, Albert Park, Victoria, Australia.  Career  =Flying= Burns said she was inspired to fly at age 10 when she visited Essendon Aerodrome, seeing Yorkshirewoman Amy Johnson fly in shortly after having completed the first solo flight by a woman from England to Australia in May 1930. At the age of 14, Jean joined the Junior Royal Victorian Aero Club and started flying lessons at the age of 17. Graduating with two other young women on 13 March 1937, she obtained her A class pilot's licence and became Australia's youngest female pilot. She held the record until Brigid Holmes broke it as a younger 17-year-old in 1952. She flew an Ansett Porterfield (Model 35 or Collegiate) with her parachute instructor Mr F B Mueller from Melbourne to District Park Aerodrome for the Newcastle Air Display on 19 February 1938. =Parachuting= Burns made her first parachute descent at Essendon Aerodrome on 21 November 1937 from an Airco DH.4 aeroplane Spirit of Melbourne at a height of . She was 17 years old and watched by an audience of somewhere between two and five thousand. The aircraft belonged to Aerat Passenger Flying (Essendon) Pty Ltd and was piloted by Howard Morris Snr. She was reported to have fallen on landing and to have suffered facial abrasions from being dragged along the ground by her parachute. Reports did not mention whether her harness was equipped with quick disconnects to avoid such injury. She was carried away by ambulancemen though not seriously injured. Burns had planned to actually descend at the age of 16, however the Civil Aviation Department were skeptical at that time, so she waited 18 months before permission was granted on the condition that her parachute be folded by a licence holder.Sydney Morning Herald 22 and 29 November 1937; The Argus, 22 November 1937 and 19 January 1938 Her second jump involved another untidy landing and was followed by a letter of warning from officials claiming the jumps were in breach of the law though she would not be prosecuted. Ambulancemen again came to her aid on her fifth jump, in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 February 1938, when winds took her off course resulting in a landing in an engineering works after avoiding two sets of high-tension electricity cables. Preparing for her sixth jump, planned for 26 February the same year in Sydney, it was reported: \\"During her five previous jumps, Miss Burns has left the plane from heights varying from . After making her last leap she did not pull the rip cord until she had dropped nearly , which rather worried some of her spectators. 'Until I am down to about there is a beautiful floating sensation, and then suddenly the ground seems to rush up and meet me. Some parachutists can land on their feet, but usually I take a fall. The landing speed is about , and the jar is about the same as you would get if you jumped off a wall,' said Miss Burns. 'In the air you can lose height more rapidly by pulling a handful of cords which causes the 'chute to sideslip. There are four red cords which you can pull on the ground to spill the air out so you are not dragged too far.' Mr. Felix Mueller, a licensed parachutist, instructed Miss Burns, and supervised the folding of her parachute, which is a very important item ‚Äì a twisted cord or a wrong fold of silk would probably mean tragedy.\\" She was also quoted as saying she had taken up jumping to raise funds to buy an aeroplane. The jump, from over Kingsford Smith Airport, resulted in Burns suffering a cut to the chin during descent and abrasions from being dragged along the ground on landing, and she again received treatment from ambulancemen. Burns only made about a dozen jumps over a period of little over a year. Later life and death Burns (left) with another pioneering Australian aviator, Nancy Bird Walton (2006) For the first time, on 21 July 2006, Burns managed to meet Nancy Bird Walton, a fellow aviator and pioneer.

It was taken over by the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) in 1865 and formed the base of a line that extended to Greenock, giving the G&SWR; access to the harbour facilities there, competing with the rival Caledonian Railway. The Greenock branch, as it had become, was given a direct access from Elderslie (about midway between Paisley and Johnstone), and fast passenger trains ran between Glasgow and Greenock. In the second half of the twentieth century usage of the line declined substantially, and the line closed in January 1983.  Formation  System map of the Bridge of Weir RailwayBy the 1860s the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) had established itself in the south-western quadrant of Scotland, while the rival Caledonian Railway was dominant in the central region, with an important branch line to Greenock. There was bitter rivalry between the two companies, and each sought to retain primacy in its own area. In September 1861 local interests approached the G&SWR;, hoping for support for a scheme to build a branch railway to Bridge of Weir, but the G&SWR; rebuffed them, as its priorities lay elsewhere at the time. Undeterred the local promoters formed a provisional scheme to build from Johnstone to Bridge of Weir, and possibly later to Kilmacolm; capital was estimated at ¬£25,000. Now the G&SWR; agreed to subscribe ¬£8,000 to the proposal, fearing that if they did not, the Caledonian Railway would. Working arrangements were finalised on 26 March 1862: the G&SWR; would work the line for 42¬Ω% of gross revenue. Conceived only as a branch line, the proposed route curved into Johnstone station facing away from Glasgow. There was a goods and mineral branch to Linwood, then a centre of industry, joining the main line by means of a backshunt.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, The Bridge of Weir Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament on 7 July 1862. At this time money was hard to come by, but the new Company was able to let a construction contract to George Hunter for ¬£15,931. The line opened to goods trains on 25 April 1864, and to passengers on 20 June 1864. The company was now short of cash and the G&SWR; agreed to defer its charges for working the line for five years at 5% interest‚Äîin effect a substantial loan.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2104, Absorption, and extending to Greenock The Caledonian Railway had a monopoly of the lucrative rail traffic to Greenock, and the G&SWR; were interested in competing. Discussions took place in October 1864, which crystallised in a proposed Greenock and Ayrshire Railway, which would extend from Bridge of Weir. The G&SWR; was to contribute ¬£150,000 to such a scheme. The Bridge of Weir line had always been worked by the G&SWR; and by the G&SWR; Amalgamation Act of 5 July 1865, the Bridge of Weir Railway company was vested in the G&SWR.; The G&SWR; wished to proceed with the line to Greenock, and needed to upgrade and widen the Bridge of Weir line; to carry out the work it closed the line from 18 May 1868. It reopened on 30 August 1869 for goods traffic, together with the curve from Elderslie to Cart Junction, enabling direct running between Glasgow and the Greenock direction. At about the same time the extension to Greenock opened too. Passenger operation on the line started on 23 December 1869. The Greenock station was named Albert Dock, but the Princes Pier was built by the Greenock Harbour Trust, and when that was ready the Greenock station was renamed . The G&SWR; developed passenger traffic to resorts in the Firth of Clyde, as well as goods traffic from Greenock trans-shipped to coastal vessels. A significant business also developed in the emigration trade. Topography The line was short; the passenger stations were: * Windyhill; opened after the end of the independent existence of the BoWR on 3 April 1871; renamed Crosslee May 1871; renamed Houston 1 January 1874; renamed Houston (Crosslee) 1 January 1875; renamed Houston 7 May 1973; closed 10 January 1983; * Tweeniehills; * Bridge of Weir; the station was closed on 18 May 1868 for the upgrading work in connection with the extension to Greenock; when the line re-opened the station on the Greenock and Ayrshire line opened, on 23 December 1869; it closed on 10 January 1983.R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, Sparkford, 1995, Rationalisation In the 1950s British Railways determined that having two competing routes to Greenock was unsustainable, and passenger trains ceased running beyond Kilmacolm in February 1959.

In 1956, he became the first Florida-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby; that year he also won the Belmont Stakes. Background Needles was a bay colt bred and raised in Ocala, Florida. He was the descendant of Blenheim and a son and grandson of Kentucky Derby winners Ponder and Pensive. Needles was a sickly foal who was given his name because of the numerous veterinary injections he was given to overcome broken ribs and pneumonia. Needles' dam Noodle Soup was a descendant of the influential Irish broodmare Golden Harp. Racing career Owned by Jack Dudley and Bonnie Heath who raced as the D & H Stable, at age two Needles won six of ten starts, including the prestigious Hopeful Stakes. His performances that year earned him the 1955 championship as two-year-old colt. Ridden by David Erb, Needles was a crowd favorite for his come-from-behind style, sometimes overcoming a 15-length deficit. The betting favorite, Needles won the 1956 Kentucky Derby by coming from 16th place in a field of 17 to make up 24 lengths and win \\"going away\\". His victory marked the first time a Florida- bred horse won America's most prestigious horse race. In the Preakness Stakes, the next leg of the U.S. Triple Crown races at Pimlico Race Course, Needles finished second to the Calumet Farm colt Fabius, whom he had beaten in the Derby. Needles came back in New York to win the grueling one and a half-mile Belmont Stakes, the final and longest leg of the Triple Crown races. Career Boy finished second and Fabius ran third. Needles earned another championship as three-year-old colt in 1956. At age four, Needles started three times, finishing 1, 2, and 3. His 1957 racing season ended early following an injury. Stud record Needles was sent to stand at stud at owner Bonnie Heath's breeding farm in Marion County, Florida. Needles' success in racing sparked a boom in Florida horse breeding. Among others, it produced notable runners such as Carry Back and Affirmed. Needles died in 1984 at the age of 31. His heart and hooves are buried in the Garden of Champions at the Ocala Breeders' Sales Company Pavilion. In 2000, he was inducted into the United States National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

It closed progressively between 1959 and 1983.  Formation  By the 1860s the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) was established in the south-western quadrant of Scotland, but the rival Caledonian Railway was dominant in the central region, with an important branch line to Greenock. There was bitter rivalry between the two companies, and each sought to retain primacy in its own area. In 1864 an independent Bridge of Weir Railway, encouraged by the G&SWR;, opened their line from Johnstone to Bridge of Weir. At that time the G&SWR; was interested in reaching Greenock, where there was lucrative business associated with coastal and international shipping. The Caledonian Railway had a monopoly of the rail connection, and in October 1864 the Chairman of the G&SWR; negotiated with the Provost of the Burgh of Greenock regarding improved rail and harbour facilities. The Caledonian Railway ended in the town at Cathcart Street, and had restricted rail access to the East Harbour involving street running. The growing trade in passenger steamer transits to towns and resorts in the Firth of Clyde was limited by the necessary walk from the station to the berth. The G&SWR; offered the possibility of a new direct rail connection to a new harbour to the north-west of the town, which the Burgh was prepared to develop. This was a prodigious scheme for both parties, involving lengthy tunnelling and the excavation and construction of the harbour facilities at a cost of ¬£250,000. The pier cost a further ¬£100,000. The railway part of the scheme was to involve the upgrading of the Bridge of Weir line, the construction of a short line from Cart Junction (on that line) to Elderslie, and a new line from Bridge of Weir to Greenock. The Greenock and Ayrshire Railway was authorised on 5 July 1865, with capital of ¬£350,000, but money had become scarce again and the G&SWR; was obliged to subscribe for ¬£300,000 of the share capital. Opening System map of the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway in 1869Construction proceeded and the line opened to goods trains on or soon after 30 August 1869, and to passengers on 23 December 1869; the line was worked by the G&SWR.; The Greenock terminal was named Albert Harbour, and as well as Clyde coastal shipping, there was a considerable emigrant trade at this time. Intermediate traffic was relatively insignificant and passenger traffic between Glasgow and Paisley and Greenock was in direct competition, both routes using the Bridge Street station in Glasgow. A fares war quickly took hold in 1870, but in early 1871 a common fares arrangement was agreed, by which the G&SWR; received 42.68% of ticket receipts. Evidently the supposed advantage of proximity to the quayside at Greenock (and a shorter route from Carlisle and Kilmarnock, via Johnstone) did not result in dominance in traffic share. Goods traffic to Greenock could use either company to reach the East Dock (via the CR) or the west (Albert Dock) via the G&SWR.;This arrangement was agreed, according to Ross, but it is not clear by what route the exchange could take place in the early years. Amalgamation Greenock railways in 1869The Greenock and Ayrshire had been nominally independent but the G&SWR; had ¬£300,000 of the ¬£350,000 capital; an amalgamation Bill was enacted on 29 June 1872, and it became effective on 1 August 1872. The line was now part of the G&SWR.; Subsequent history The Greenock Harbour Trust had been continuing improvement of the harbour, providing alongside berthing for quick turnrounds, and with more capacity. In 1875, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, landed at the pier and the opportunity was taken to rename the harbour facility Prince's Pier. The station itself was renamed at the same time. In 1894 the station was relocated a little to the north-west, closer to the steamer berths, and providing more lavish facilities, and with six italianate towers. Greenock railways in 1889In 1880 the harbour facilities to the eastern side of Greenock were being further extended, at Garvel, at the east end of the waterfront. When completed it provided three miles (5 km) of quays with the most modern mechanical handling equipment. The G&SWR; wished to retain its place in the marine activity and decided to build a connecting line eastwards from Lynedoch, requiring a short tunnel. The line opened on 5 August 1886; the junction at Lynedoch was named Cartsburn Junction, and G&SWR; trains reversed there, descending to a spur at Inchgreen, where they reversed again to reach the quay. The Caledonian Railway also had a connection to the new facility; their access was somewhat easier. The G&SWR;'s branch had cost ¬£262,467. The west curve at Johnstone, giving through running from that station towards Greenock, was an accident of history (of the Bridge of Weir Railway). Use of the curve by passenger trains was discontinued on 1 October 1900. 1936 runaway David Smith records an accident: > A most destructive breakaway occurred on ... 10 April 1936. A train of 37 > wagons of cattle left Albert Harbour for Carlisle at 9.00 p.m., double > headed, the pilot engine being a 2-6-4 tank. They were up about Closure Stopping services over the northern section of line, beyond Kilmacolm, were cut in February 1959 although goods trains, and also special boat trains from Glasgow St Enoch continued to run until 30 November 1965; during this period the line beyond Kilmacolm was singled. Stopping passenger services ceased running beyond Kilmacolm in February 1959. However the Glasgow St Enoch railway station to Greenock Prince's Pier Ocean Liner boat trains continued running until 30 November 1965. The tracks were then cut at Kilmacolm in September 1966. Greenock railways in 1971However this was not the end of rail connection to Princes Pier: it was redeveloped as a container terminal, operated by the Clyde Port Authority, and rail connection was reinstated in 1971. The original line and the James Watt Dock connection were close alongside the Wemyss Bay line from Port Glasgow immediately east of Lynedoch, and a connection was made there: so the original G&AR; line was re- opened to container traffic west of Lynedoch. The line was now single and laid in the centre of the tunnels, enabling 8 foot (2.44 m) containers to pass. In fact this did not prove a long-term opportunity, and rail movement became dormant for many years; containers in use were larger than the original 8-foot size, and cannot be moved through the tunnels, and the line was officially closed on 30 September 1991. The 1966 closure at Greenock left the line open from Elderslie to Kilmacolm; local passenger services continued, using diesel multiple units. That section too closed completely on 10 January 1983. Topography The line ran from Bridge of Weir to Greenock, with a connection from Cartsburn Junction to James Watt Dock. The main line opened to passengers on 23 December 1869; locations were: * Connection at Bridge of Weir to the former Bridge of Weir Railway; * Bridge of Weir station; the Bridge of Weir Railway station there was by-passed; * Upper Port Glasgow; goods station only; * Cartsburn Junction; not a passenger station; * Lynedoch; renamed Greenock Lynedoch May 1898; closed 2 February 1959 * Greenock, Albert Harbour; renamed Greenock Princes Pier 1 May 1875; relocated a short distance north-west 25 May 1894; closed except to boat trains 2 February 1959; closed 30 November 1965. The double-track route required five tunnels in two miles; the longest, Union Street Tunnel is 710 yards (649 m) in length on a falling gradient towards the Clyde of 1 in 70, with sharp curves at each end. The James Watt branch was goods only; locations were * Cartsburn Junction; * Inch Green; reversing siding; * James Watt Dock. The large and attractive terminal station at Princes Pier was built on the quayside, attracting passengers who boarded Clyde steamers there to visit holiday resorts down the Firth of Clyde or to commute in summer to their villas around the shores of the firth. It took most of the steamer trade away from the Caledonian Railway whose Cathcart Street station was a short but inconvenient walk through part of Greenock to the Custom House quay, leading them to organise an extension to Gourock, with Gourock railway station opening as a rival terminal in 1889.

It is an action against the holder of a public office, alleging in essence that the office-holder has misused or abused their power. The tort can be traced back to 1703 when Chief Justice Sir John Holt decided that a landowner could sue a police constable who deprived him of his right to vote (Ashby v White). The tort was revived in 1985 when it was used so that French turkey producers could sue the Ministry of Agriculture over a dispute that harmed their sales. Generally, a civil defendant will be liable for misfeasance if the defendant owed a duty of care toward the plaintiff, the defendant breached that duty of care by improperly performing a legal act, and the improper performance resulted in harm to the plaintiff. In theory, misfeasance is distinct from nonfeasance. Nonfeasance is a failure to act that results in harm to another party. Misfeasance, by contrast, is some affirmative act that, though legal, causes harm. In practice, the distinction is confusing and uninstructive. Courts often have difficulty determining whether harm resulted from a failure to act or from an act that was improperly performed.  Grounds  In most cases, the essentials to bring an action of misfeasance in public office are that the office-holder acted illegally, knew they were doing so, and knew or should reasonably have known that third parties would suffer loss as a result.  BCCI  As a civil law action, the use of misfeasance of public office has grown in recent years, the law having been clarified in the litigation involving the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The ruling clarified that there are two types of misfeasance in public office. One known as \\"targeted malice\\" occurs when a public officer intentionally abuses their position with the motive of inflicting damage upon the claimant. The second is termed \\"untargeted malice\\"; this is committed by a public official who acts in an generalized way, knowing that they are not legally empowered to do the act complained of.  Railtrack  In July 2005, 49,500 private shareholders of Britain's national railway infrastructure company Railtrack sued the Secretary of State for Transport for damages, alleging that in October 2001 the then holder of that office, Stephen Byers MP, had acted unlawfully in planning to put their company into administration on the grounds that it was insolvent. The legal action failed because ‚Äì as an action involving reflective loss ‚Äì the shareholders had to prove, in addition to the grounds specified above, malice on the part of Byers. They did not have the evidence to do so.

The town is located 8 km south of Kottayam town, and is bordered by the towns of Kaipuzha, Athirampuzha, Kallara, Manjoor, Vechoor, and Onamthuruthu. Geography Needoor is on the northern border of \\"Kuttanadu,\\" 16 km from Kottayam and 7.5 km from Ettumanoor. In old days, say up until the early 1990s, the \\"punchapadam\\" (rice fields) gave a distinct Kuttandu look for Neendoor. The greenery is still there, what are missing are rice fields and farming. The income comes now mostly from non-farming. Economy In terms of pure currency in-flow, money sent by ex-pats play a huge role (Middle East, USA, UK, Australia etc.) . Rubber is Neendoor's major cash crop. Up until the late 1970s, rice was a major cash crop as well. However, in the last several decades, the local economy has increasingly been bolstered by cash sent by Indian expatriates living in the Middle East, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. This foreign support has contributed to the town's development in recent years - for example, with large mansions replacing the existing small houses. For whatever reason, many expatriates who worked out of state or out of country all their working life come back to Neendoor at retirement and prefer to build a house in the already crowded neighborhood. Education Nearly 100% of the young adults will graduate from high school and a big majority will get some college education or a degree. Although English is rarely spoken, most college level students can understand and write in English. Demographics The population of Neendoor is primarily of Hindus and Knanaya Catholics.

It is made up of people of the Pabaksa (Ih√°≈ãkthu≈ãwa≈ãna), Sisseton (Sis√≠thu≈ãwa≈ã) and Wahpeton (Wa»üp√©thu≈ãwa≈ã) bands of the Dakota tribe. Established in 1867 in a treaty between Sisseton-Wahpeton Bands and the United States government, the reservation, at , consists of of land area, primarily in Benson and Eddy counties. Smaller areas extend into Ramsey, Wells and Nelson counties. According to the tribal enrollment office in 2014, the tribe had 7,256 members enrolled members. At the time of the U.S. 2010 census, 3,587 members out of a total of 4,238 people (including non-tribal members) were residing on the reservation. The unemployment rate was 47.3% in 2000. The largest community on the reservation is Fort Totten. Environment (Devil's Lake, ND, June 5, 2009) A road is covered with water from Devils Lake, which has been steadily rising for the last several years, threatening homes and businesses in the areaThe reservation of the tribe is located on the southern shore of Devil's Lake, which has been historically the territory of the Dakota people. The Sisseton, Wahpeton, and Cut-Head bands of Dakotas were relocated to the Spirit Lake Reservation as a result of the 1867 treaty with the United States that established a reservation for Dakotas who had not been forcibly relocated to Crow Creek Reservation in what is now called South Dakota. The name \\"Devils Lake\\" is a calque of the Dakota words mni (water) wak‚Äô√°≈ã (literally \\"pure source\\", also translated as \\"spirit\\" or \\"sacred\\"). The Dakota consider it holy because they believe it is the home of the underwater serpent Unktehi. The Dakota name is reflected in the name of the Spirit Lake Tribe and the nearby town of Minnewaukan. European-American settlers misconstrued this name to mean \\"Bad Spirit Lake\\", or \\"Devils Lake\\". The \\"bad\\" referred to the high salinity of the lake, making it unfit to drink, and \\"spirit\\" meant the mirages often seen across the water. The Christian concept of the devil is not present in Dakota philosophy. Because Devil's Lake is a closed-basin watershed, the reservation has suffered increasingly frequent episodes of flooding since the 1990s. It has lost homes, land and economic opportunities due to the severity of this problem. Tribal chairperson, Myra Pearson, appealed in the 21st century to President Barack Obama and his White House for assistance. Since then tribal representatives have engaged with a multi-agency task force led by Federal Emergency Management Agency officials to develop a recovery plan. It was published in 2010 and includes economic and cultural development goals in addition to strategies to combat the flooding. Government =Historical= The reservation boundaries in 1892Prior to the reservation era, Dakota tribal societies were without social classes and government was democratic and highly decentralized. An individual's status was based on their ability to serve and perform and leaders existed to serve the will of the people. Fraternal societies played a role in maintaining a government structure known as the council and prior to the reservation era, no single person was in charge of decision-making. Following the Dakota War of 1862, many long lines of hereditary leadership ceased to exist as several bands of Sisseton and Wahpeton were forced to flee Minnesota into various locations throughout the Dakotas. Other leaders were killed, deposed or replaced by those chosen by the United States government to act as spokesperson. The U.S. government and the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of Dakota signed a treaty in 1867 that established the Fort Totten Reservation. The name was later changed to the Devils Lake Sioux Reservation. In 1996, the Spirit Lake Tribe changed the name to a more correct translation of Mni Wakan. Historical leadership Chief Wanata II, also known as Chief Wanataan II, 1828-1897 *Standing Buffalo 1833-1864. Standing Buffalo was born about 1833 near the headwaters of the Minnesota River.

He died in a battle with the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine on June 5, 1871. *Gabriel Renville (Ti'wakan) 1880-1890. When the Dakota War of 1862 began, Renville helped to organize a soldier's lodge that opposed the fighting. Renville was not a hereditary leader but was appointed leader by the American government after serving as a scout for three years. He helped organize the new Sisseton reservation after signing the treaty of 1867. He served as chief of the Sisseton and Wahpeton on the Spirit Lake reservation throughout the 1880s and 1890s. *Sipto (Bead) 1834-1921. Sipto was a hereditary chief of the Abdowapusikiya (Back Drying) Band of the Sisseton. His father, Hoksinawasteka (Goodboy, 1805-1890) was the son of Standing Buffalo and related to Wanataan.

For years both tribal and federal law enforcement officials had failed to prosecute such crimes. The reservation residents include a high number of registered sex offenders, some of whom have responsibility for children. Officials suggest that poverty and alcohol abuse have contributed to the problems. Kind Hearted Woman (2013) is a PBS Frontline documentary about Robin Poor Bear, a woman on the Spirit Lake Reservation, and the severe problems of sexual abuse and violence there. On October 1, 2012 the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) took over the tribe's social services program to strengthen protection of children. It investigated 100 reported cases of such abuse in the first month. In February 2013, the two North Dakota senators and a representative met with tribal officials and members at a town hall meeting at Spirit Lake to discuss reforms underway, including fingerprinting of all adults living with foster children (a requirement that had not been satisfied before). Because of listening sessions on the reservation, the Administration for Children and Families (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) developed seven priority recommendations to be addressed by child welfare stakeholders at the Spirit Lake Reservation. Included was a recommendation for the Spirit Lake Tribal Social Services Agency and BIA to jointly develop policies and procedures that encompass all aspects of child welfare services including that foster homes must comply with federal and state safety checks, including background checks on all adults residing in the home. As a result of the exposure of crimes against children on the reservation, the Native American Children's Safety Act enacted in 2016 amends the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act to further ensure children's safety by requiring Indian Tribes to conduct background checks before placing children in foster care. In February 2019 it was announced that the tribe had successfully completed steps to regain full control of the tribal child welfare program. Chairwoman Myra Pearson said, \\"The transition has been a work in progress but tribal leaders, employees and the community are determined to protect the children.\\" She also said it was vitally important for the tribe regain control because children were placed outside of the community while the program was controlled by the BIA; in order for the children to maintain cultural ties, they need to be immersed in their culture. The tribe is encouraging community members to study social work at Cankdeska Cikana Community College and they are also working with outside organizations such as the Annie E. Casey Foundation to establish relationships with specialists in the field. Communities The General Store and Post Office in Saint Michael, ND School children enjoying wagonride at Fort Totten, late 19th or early 20th century Fort Totten is the reservation's economic and government center. The tribal administration, tribal college and Spirit Lake Consulting offices are located in the community. The tribe's Vocational Rehabilitation program works to assist tribal members in finding employment. *Crow Hill District, Crow Hill, North Dakota *Fort Totten District, Fort Totten, North Dakota *Mission District, St. Michael, North Dakota *Woodlake District, Tokio, North Dakota The historic village of Cantemaza's Wahpeton bands was located north of Warwick, ND, near the edge of East Devils Lake. The villages of Tiowaste and Waanatan's Sisituwan bands were located at present-day St. Michael. Historically the village of Matocatka (Left Bear)'s Wahpeton bands was at Woodlake and Wahacankaduta (Scarlet Shield)'s Pabaksa (Ihanktonwan) bands was located at Crow Hill. Economy American bison grazing at the White Horse Hill National Game Preserve located on the reservation The Sioux Manufacturing Corporation, a manufacturer of composite armed armors, is located on the reservation. It is 100% owned by the tribe and is one of the oldest tribal- owned businesses in the country. It opened in 1973 and by 1989, the tribe had purchased the last remaining shares of the company owned by the Brunswick Corporation, thereby gaining full ownership. Currently, 75% of the workforce is Native American and their products are created for the United States Department of Defense out of their 250,000 square foot manufacturing facility. Additional visitor attractions at the reservation are the White Horse Hill National Game Preserve and the Fort Totten State Historic Site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Spirit Lake Tribe operates Cankdeska Cikana Community College, a tribal college established in the 1970s. The two-year college provides classes in subject areas needed by the reservation and to prepare students for other jobs, as well as strengthening their Dakota culture and language. =Spirit Lake Casino and Resort= Since the late 20th century, the tribe has operated various gaming facilities on its reservation to generate revenues for the welfare of its people. The first casino opened in St. Michael, North Dakota with the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 when the tribe signed an agreement with the Governor of North Dakota. The first facility initially employed 35 individuals, most of whom were tribal members. Later, in 1994, the tribe renovated a gymnasium and added a second casino in Tokio, ND. This development created employment for 191 people. The tribe had closed both of those two smaller casinos in 1996 and on June 1, 1996, after a $7 million investment opened the new 49,000 square foot casino at its present location. The present Spirit Lake Casino and Resort is owned and operated by the tribe and is located in St. Michaels, North Dakota. The casino has brought new sources of income and helped to stabilize the tribal economy employing over 300 people with 75% being Native American. It is a multi-story facility comprising 82,000 square feet of Gaming & Entertainment Floor and 112,300 square feet of Resort and Hotel on a remote island connected by a 2-lane highway off of Mission Bay, North Dakota. After numerous renovations since its opening, it now has almost 150 hotel rooms, a 1,000-seat auditorium, a banquet hall, RV park, gift shop and a four-story aquatic center. In 2011 more job opportunities were added when the Spirit Lake Marina and Spirit Lake Grocery store were added to the grounds of the casino. The marina hosts a fishing tournament every summer.

There is a relation with test costs and failure costs (direct, indirect, costs for fault correction). Some factors which influence test effort are: maturity of the software development process, quality and testability of the testobject, test infrastructure, skills of staff members, quality goals and test strategy.  Methods for estimation of the test effort  To analyse all factors is difficult, because most of the factors influence each other. Following approaches can be used for the estimation: top-down estimation and bottom-up estimation. The top-down techniques are formula based and they are relative to the expenses for development: Function Point Analysis (FPA) and Test Point Analysis (TPA) amongst others. Bottom-up techniques are based on detailed information and involve often experts. The following techniques belong here: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Wide Band Delphi (WBD). We can also use the following techniques for estimating the test effort: * Conversion of software size into person hours of effort directly using a conversion factor. For example, we assign 2 person hours of testing effort per one Function Point of software size or 4 person hours of testing effort per one use case point or 3 person hours of testing effort per one Software Size Unit * Conversion of software size into testing project size such as Test Points or Software Test Units using a conversion factor and then convert testing project size into effort * Compute testing project size using Test Points of Software Test Units. Methodology for deriving the testing project size in Test Points is not well documented. However, methodology for deriving Software Test Units is defined in a paper by Murali * We can also derive software testing project size and effort using Delphi Technique or Analogy Based Estimation technique.  Test efforts from literature In literature test efforts relative to total costs are between 20% and 70%. These values are amongst others dependent from the project specific conditions. When looking for the test effort in the single phases of the test process, these are diversely distributed: with about 40% for test specification and test execution each.

The WFCU Centre replaced the 84-year-old Windsor Arena as the primary home of the Windsor Spitfires. It opened on December 11, 2008, in the east end of the city. The WFCU Centre is owned by the City of Windsor, operated by Comcast Spectacor, and named for Windsor Family Credit Union. History City council approved the project on October 4, 2006, and the groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 22, 2007. The WFCU Centre was built at a cost of approximately $71 million by the Windsor, Ontario-based construction company, PCR Contractors. The land was purchased from London, Ontario developer Farhi Holdings Corporation. The construction of this sports- entertainment centre was decided upon as a part of the city government's overall effort to add excitement to the economy. As part of that effort, Windsor city council committed to building the centre, and agreed to fund most of the cost. During the initial stages of planning, several other committees and companies proposed building arenas and venues in the area, including a privately owned skating arena, as well as proposed a relocation of the Windsor Raceway Slots to Tecumseh, Ontario, owned by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. In August, 2013 Windsor City Council approved a $6.5 million addition to the WFCU Centre, adding a 25-metre pool in advance of the city hosting the 2016 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) which were held inside the WFCU Centre. The WFCU Centre complies with the Ontarians with Disabilities Act. Sports The exterior of the WFCU Centre The WFCU Centre is home to both the Ontario Hockey League OHL's Windsor Spitfires and the National Basketball League of Canada NBLC's Windsor Express. The Windsor Spitfires won both the 2009 and 2010 OHL Championship final series on home ice, and the Windsor Express won the 2014 League Championships on home court. The WFCU Centre has played host to a variety of large-scale events in hockey including the 2012 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, the OHL All Star Game and the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game. The WFCU Centre also hosted both the Skate Canada Synchronized Skating Championships and the Skate Canada International in 2012, the latter being broadcast internationally.

Early years Richard Carnac Temple was born in Allahabad, India, on 15 October 1850. He was the eldest son of Sir Richard Temple (1826-1902), a baronet, and his first wife, Charlotte Frances (n√©e Martindale, d. 1855). His father was from The Nash in Kempsey, Worcestershire and was at that time working as a civil servant in India. His father eventually served as Governor of Bombay Presidency (1877-80), a position that had also been held by Richard Carnac Temple's great-grandfather, Sir James Rivett Carnac between 1838-41. Military and administrative career After education at Harrow School and, from 1868, at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Temple was commissioned in the Royal Scots Fusiliers in 1871. He was transferred to the British Indian Army in 1877, being mentioned in despatches while serving with the 38th Dogras in the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878-79. By this time, he had risen from his original rank of Ensign to that of Lieutenant in the Bengal Staff Corps. Temple was then transferred to the 1st Gurkha Regiment and appointed a cantonment magistrate in 1879 in Punjab Province. It was now that he began to take what became his abiding interest in the folklore, history and ethnology of India. Promoted to Captain in 1881, he served in the Third Burmese War from 1885 and as a consequence, in 1887, was given charge of Mandalay following the removal of king Thibaw. Temple became a Major in 1891 and was appointed President of the Rangoon municipality and also its Port-Commissioner. While based there he established various volunteer forces, including the Rangoon Naval Volunteers. Subsequently, from 1895 until his retirement in 1904, he was Chief Commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was also Superintendent of the penal settlement at Port Blair. His final promotion was in 1897, when he attained the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Later career Temple had succeeded to the Temple Baronetcy of the Nash on 15 March 1902 upon the death of his father. It was after this and during his retirement that he dedicated himself to writing. He lived at The Nash from 1904 and continued writing after 1921, when ill-health and domestic circumstances forced him to move away from Britain to spend much of his time living in hotels around Territet in Vaud, Switzerland. The lavish lifestyle of his son and the high taxation introduced during the First World War caused him such financial difficulties that he sold The Nash in 1926. Temple had been honoured as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1894, recognising his work in India, and in 1913 he was President of the anthropological section of the British Association. In 1916, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in recognition of his involvement with the Joint Committee of the St. John Ambulance Association and British Red Cross that operated during World War I. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1925, he was also appointed a Bailiff Grand Cross of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem in 1927 and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He served as a Justice of the Peace and as a Deputy-Lieutenant of Worcestershire. He was chairman of the Standing Council of the Baronetage and was appointed a member of the Home Departmental Committee to enquire into the Status of Baronets, was Deputy Chairman of the Military Home Hospital Reserve, Chairman of the St. John Ambulance Association, and Chairman of the Worcester County Association under the new Territorial Forces Act. Anthropology Temple was an amateur anthropologist.Relational Museum Collector Information He assembled collections for the British Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum (Oxford) and established a small museum in his home in Kempsey but sold much of this in 1921. He was a member of the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the Philological Society, the Folklore Society and the Royal Anthropological Institute. He was a Silver Medalist of the Royal Society of Arts. He was sometime President of the Bombay Anthropological Society. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall in 1908 and at the time of his death was serving as a vice-president of the Hakluyt Society, upon the Council of which he had served continuously since soon after retirement . Writings Temple joined the Folklore Society in 1885 and among the papers he published in its journal was The science of folk-lore (1886). He wrote various works often dealing with the religions and geography of India. He believed that a knowledge of local folklore was useful both to ruler and ruled. He wrote in 1914: He wrote The Andaman Language, published in conjunction with E. H. Man in 1887. Seven years later in collaboration with Flora Annie Steel, an Anglo- Indian novelist, he wrote Wideawake Stories, a collection of Indian folk- tales. Later, he was responsible for the production of Legends of the Punjab, in the vernacular with translation, in three volumes, which were published between 1883 and 1890, and The Thirty-Seven Nats, a study of animism in Burma, in 1906, a highly illustrated volume; edited Fallon's Devil-Worship of the Tuluvas in 1897. For the Hakluyt Society, Temple was editor of two works of seventeenth-century travels: Thomas Bowrey's A Geographical Account of the Countries Round the Bay of Bengal, 1669-1679 (1905), and the manuscripts of Peter Mundy, titled The Travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia, 1608-1667 (1907‚Äì28).

It was based on a short story named \\"Saturn Alia\\". It was followed by a sequel, A Lion on Tharthee. Plot summary In the late twenty-first century, a system of space colonies, known collectively as SpaceHome, is slowly winning economic independence from Earth. SpaceHome's president, George Ogumi, is singleminded in this pursuit. Things are shaken up when SpaceHome discovers an alien object on Saturn's moon Iapetus. SpaceHome University's sole archeologist, Dr. Kurious Whitedimple (who constantly reminds amused inquisitors his name is pronounced \\"KOOR-ee-us\\"), is called in for his opinion by Ogumi. Whitedimple (called Whitey) is able to interpret the message‚Äîfor so it is. The message is: there are three other identical messages on other moons, a fifth hidden somewhere in the rings of Saturn which will give directions to a sixth artifact, of immense importance. Dazzled by Ogumi, Whitey loses sight of odd things going on around him, and is swiftly shipped off to Saturn to recover the rings artifact, despite an \\"accident\\" that nearly kills him. On arrival, Whitey is introduced to Junior Badille, his pilot. Born in high-radiation outer space, Junior is a mutant supergenius, whom Whitey affectionately refers to as \\"the runt\\" and \\"the gnome\\". Earth has not been quiet, and sends off its own expedition. The Earthers open fire, but Whitey and Badille are able to outmanoeuver them and recover the artifact. The message on the artifact is that the sixth artifact is located on Saturn's liquid surface. (At this point, the short story ends.) Both Earth and SpaceHome gear up for massive efforts. Junior and Whitey, who have formed a strong bond, part, and Whitey returns to teaching classes at the university, first having strong words with Ogumi over what Whitey deems to be deceit. However, SpaceHome has become too small for Whitey now. He enrolls in space pilot training and becomes a brilliant student. As Whitey qualifies, Junior, now the brains behind SpaceHome's Mimas-based efforts to recover the last artifact, stages a strike‚ÄîWhitey must return or Junior will be so \\"depressed\\" he cannot work. Ogumi has little choice but to send Whitey back to Saturn as a pilot. Whitey becomes the lead pilot for the recovery effort. However, an Earth expedition stages a simultaneous attempt, and at first seems to have everything going for it, until it suffers massive malfunctions. Whitey sacrifices the mission to dive deep into Saturn's atmosphere and rescue the Earth pilot and his vessel. While he is still recovering, SpaceHome's backup mission recovers the artifact. The artifact proves to be a much more complex message‚Äîthere is a starship at a specified location in the outer solar system. When activated, it is assumed that the ship will take anyone aboard to the aliens' star system. As the story ends, Earth and SpaceHome work together to mount a joint expedition. Reception Bob Ketelle, in his Las Vegas Review- Journal review, described the book as \\"an old but good space tale\\", opining that the \\"story is fun and mostly satisfying.\\" In the 1986 Locus Awards, it was ranked 12th for Best First Novel.

He was a member of the Niue People's Party. Lakatani served in the New Zealand Army as a corporal. He was deployed to Vietnam as part of the Whiskey2 deployment. Early political career He was first elected to the Niue Assembly in the 1990 election. In the leadup to the election Lakatani's Niue People's Action Party merged with Young Vivian's Action Party. Lakatani won a common roll seat and was appointed to the Cabinet of Robert Rex as Minister of Finance. He was sacked just five months later after circulating a petition calling for a change of leadership. He was re-elected in 1993 and reappointed as Finance Minister by Frank Lui. He resigned in March 1994, but was reinstated by Lui in the leadup to a confidence vote. He subsequently lost his finance portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle in October 1994 and resigned from Cabinet on 8 November. Lakatani joined the opposition, which organised itself into the Niue People's Party and effectively deadlocked the assembly. With other members of the opposition, Lakatani boycotted meetings of the Public Expenditure Committee, and as a result his seat was declared vacant in August 1995. He was reinstated after a successful challenge before the High Court and the new Niue Court of Appeal, but in the interim was re-elected, coming sixth on the common roll in the 1996 election. In October 1995 Lakatani was charged with 22 counts of bribery and two of official corruption. Most of the charges were dismissed after the Niue Court of Appeal found that the law against corruption did not apply to Members of the Assembly, and the remaining charges were later dropped. Premier Lakatani was re-elected at the 1999 Niuean general election, placing third on the common roll with 474 votes. He was subsequently elected leader of the Niue People's Party, and was elected Premier, defeating O'Love Jacobsen by 14 votes to 6. As Premier, he cut the pay of MPs, unsuccessfully attempted to obtain a loan from the Asian Development Bank to counteract declining assistance from New Zealand, and attempted to establish an airline. In July 1999 he was hospitalised in Auckland and underwent a double bypass heart operation. In his absence, the growing unpopularity of his government saw it lose its majority. A no-confidence vote in December resulted in a 10-10 tie, a judicial challenge, and an opposition walkout. In 2000, he narrowly avoided bankruptcy over a personal guarantee given for the debt of a Niue business, and this resulted in a further confidence vote which was again tied, 9-9. Lakatani faced a further confidence vote in November 2000. While Prime Minister he served as Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific. He was re-elected in 2002 Niuean general election, but his dictatorial leadership style saw him lose the leadership of the People's Party to Young Vivian, who subsequently became Premier, with Lakatani as his Deputy. In August 2002 he was sacked from Cabinet after voting against the budget. In 2003 he took an extended leave from the Assembly to look after his wife in Auckland. He resigned from the Assembly in June 2004.

She moved from Germany to Pakistan in 1961 and devoted more than 55 years of her life to fighting leprosy in Pakistan. Pfau was honoured with the Hilal-i-Pakistan-, Hilal-i- Imtiaz-, Nishan-i-Quaid-i-Azam-, and the Sitara-i-Quaid-i-Azam award. Pfau contributed to the establishment of 157 leprosy clinics across Pakistan that treated over 56,780 people. Fazaia Ruth Pfau Medical College and Dr. Ruth Pfau Hospital are named after her in Karachi.  Early life  Pfau was born on 9 September 1929 in Leipzig, Germany, to Lutheran Christian parents. She had four sisters and one brother. Her home was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Following the post-war Soviet occupation of East Germany she moved to West Germany along with her family, and chose medicine as her future career. During the 1950s, she studied medicine at the University of Mainz. During this period Pfau frequently met a Dutch Christian woman who was a concentration camp survivor and was dedicating her life to \\"preaching love and forgiveness\\". After \\"her life-changing experience\\", Pfau left \\"a romantic association\\" with a fellow student and became involved in discussions in Mainz's philosophy and classical literature department. After completing her clinical examination, Pfau moved to Marburg to carry on her clinical studies. She was baptised as an Evangelical Protestant in 1951, before her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1953.Pfau (2007), pp. 49‚Äì50 Pfau stated that she learned the \\"courage of being human\\" from Saint Thomas Aquinas through Josef Pieper's writing.Pfau (2007), pp. 48‚Äì49 She joined a Catholic parish, and she was greatly influenced by Romano Guardini's The Lord in this period. In 1957, Pfau travelled to Paris and joined the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, a Catholic order. She said, \\"When you receive such a calling, you cannot turn it down, for it is not you who has made the choice. ... God has chosen you for himself.\\" The order later sent her to southern India; however, in 1960, a visa issue meant she had to stay in Karachi. She travelled to various parts of Pakistan and across the border to Afghanistan to rescue patients who were abandoned by their families or locked in small rooms for a lifetime.  Life in Pakistan  In 1960, aged 31, Pfau decided to dedicate the rest of her life to the people of Pakistan and their battle against leprosy outbreaks. While in Karachi, by chance she visited the Lepers‚Äô Colony behind McLeod Road (now I. I. Chundrigar Road) near the City Railway Station. Here she decided that the care of patients would be her life's calling. She started medical treatment for the leprosy patients in a hut in this area. The Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre was founded (which later branched out into tuberculosis and blindness prevention programmes) and social work for the leprosy patients and their family members was started by Dr I K Gill. A leprosy clinic was bought in April 1963 and patients from all over Karachi, from elsewhere in Pakistan, and even from Afghanistan came for treatment. In 1979, she was appointed as the Federal Advisor on Leprosy to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Government of Pakistan. Pfau went to distant areas of Pakistan where there were no medical facilities for leprosy patients. She collected donations in Germany and Pakistan and co-operated with hospitals in Rawalpindi and Karachi. In recognition of her service to the country, she was awarded Pakistani citizenship in 1988.\\"German Catholic nun feted on her 70th birthday for her on-going work to eradicate leprosy in Pakistan\\", UCANews, 1 October 1999. Due to her continued efforts, in 1996 the World Health Organization declared Pakistan one of the first countries in Asia to have controlled leprosy. According to the Dawn, the number of leprosy cases nationwide dropped significantly from 19,398 in the early 1980s to 531 in 2016. On 9 September 1999, the Archbishop of Karachi, Simeon Anthony Pereira, celebrated a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to celebrate Pfau's 70th birthday, which was attended by both Christians and Muslims.  Death  In the early morning on 10 August 2017, around 4:00 a.m. PST, Pfau died at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi after being admitted there due to respiratory problems on 4 August 2017. She was put on a ventilator after her condition worsened on 6 August. She refused life support, which her doctors removed the next day, according to her wish for \\"living a natural life\\". Pfau had been dealing with several health problems due to her advanced age, including kidney and heart disease, for which she had been undergoing treatment for several years. = Reaction = President Mamnoon Hussain issued the statement: \\"Dr Pfau‚Äôs services to end leprosy in Pakistan cannot be forgotten. She left her homeland and made Pakistan her home to serve humanity. The Pakistani nation salutes Dr Pfau and her great tradition to serve humanity will be continued.\\" Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said: \\"Dr Ruth Pfau may have been born in Germany, [but] her heart was always in Pakistan.\\" He further added that, \\"she came here at the dawn of a young nation looking to make lives better for those afflicted by disease and in doing so found herself a home. We will remember her for her courage, her loyalty, her service to the eradication of leprosy and most of all her patriotism.\\" He also announced that a state funeral would be held for her. Chief of Army Staff Qamar Bajwa referred to Pfau as an \\"ambassador of humanity\\". Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sohail Amaan named a medical college, being built at an airbase in Karachi, in her name. The college is now named as \\"Fazaia Ruth Pfau Medical College\\". Its first classes are expected to commence in December 2019. = State funeral = On 19 September 2017, Pfau's body lay in state at the Holy Family Hospital in Karachi ahead of the funeral. The state funeral for Pfau was held at Saint Patrick's Cathedral, in front of which the flags of Pakistan and Vatican City were flown at half mast, with Archbishop Joseph Coutts presiding over the Requiem. The Pakistani flag was draped over her coffin and a 19-gun salute was offered by contingents of all three wings of the Pakistan Armed Forces. The ceremony was broadcast live on Pakistan Television. Pfau was reportedly the first Christian and first non-Muslim to have a state funeral in Pakistan. She was then buried at Gora Qabaristan, a Christian cemetery in Karachi.  Legacy  Pfau is well respected by Muslims in Pakistan who were the majority of patients at the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre. Saleem Maseh Amir says that she never talked about religion, yet \\"her faith, service, and love\\" were demonstrations of the spirit that inspired inter-religious dialogue. In 2018, Pfau's private residence in Karachi was converted into a museum to showcase some of her personal possessions.  Awards and recognition  Pfau is recognized in Pakistan and abroad as a distinguished human being, and had been awarded many awards and medals. On 23 March 1989, Pfau received the Hilal-i-Pakistan award presented by the then-President of Pakistan Ghulam Ishaq Khan at the President House for her work with leprosy patients. Speaking at a function in Islamabad on 30 January 2000 to mark the 47th World Leprosy Day, the then-President Rafiq Tarar praised Pfau, who built up the National Leprosy Control Program in Pakistan, for working not only for those afflicted with leprosy but also for those with tuberculosis. In 2006, Pfau was honoured as the 'Woman of the Year 2006' by City FM89. On 14 August 2010, on the occasion of Pakistan's Independence Day, the then-President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari awarded Pfau the Nishan-i-Quaid-i-Azam for public service.Press List of civil awards on the occasion of Independence Day , pid.gov.pk, 14 August 2010. She was hailed as Pakistan's \\"Mother Teresa\\" after her work towards helping people displaced by the 2010 Pakistan floods. In 2015, Pfau was awarded the Staufer Medal, the highest award of the German state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg. On 19 August 2017, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah announced renaming of the Civil Hospital Karachi to Dr Ruth Pfau Hospital as an acknowledgment of \\"selfless services of the late social servant\\". On 9 September 2019, Google honoured her with a Google Doodle of her treating a patient. In February 2020, the President of Pakistan Dr. Arif Alvi inaugurated the Fazaia Ruth Pfau Medical College in Karachi.

He was one of the Salaf and a Narrator of hadith. After Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya died, his son Abu Hashim claimed the imamate. According to medieval mystic Jami, Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (died c. 716) was the first person to be called a \\"Sufi\\". Life After Abu Hashim's death, the Abbasids claimed that on his deathbed Abu Hashim had nominated his distant cousin Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Abdullah ibn Abbas ibn Abdu'l-Muttalib ibn Hashim as the imam. His son Abu'l-Abbas Abdullah as-Saffah became the first Abbasid caliph, repudiating Shi'ism, which effectively extinguished the sect that had recognized Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah as an imam. Abu Hashim's father was Muhammad ibn al Hanafiyyah ibn Ali, a son of Ali. Abu Hashim had a brother named Hasan. After his father's death in 700 CE, the Hashimiyya sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia looked to Abu Hashim as the heir of his grandfather Ali. After his own death, the early Abbasids claimed that Abu Hashim had designated Muhammad, father of the first two Abbasid caliphs, As-Saffah and Al-Mansur, as his heir and head of the clan of the Banu Hashim.

Schulz. It was originally aired on the ABC network on November 20, 2006. It is the second most recent Peanuts television special and is primarily based on a story from the Peanuts comic strips originally appearing in April 1995. He's a Bully, Charlie Brown was an idea Schulz had pitched, and worked on before his death on February 12, 2000. Schulz's working title for the special was It's Only Marbles, Charlie Brown. Animation was produced by Toon-Us-In. It is the last special to be produced by and feature Bill Melendez as the voice of Snoopy and Woodstock, as he died on September 2, 2008. It was also the last new special to air on ABC as the next special Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown aired on Fox. This is also the last Peanuts special from the 2000s, and the last special to be in standard definition. Plot At home, Rerun van Pelt finds some old marbles his grandfather Felix ‚Äî a marble master in his day‚Äîkept in the attic. Charlie Brown goes to summer camp with Marcie while Peppermint Patty is stuck in summer school. He and Snoopy get ready for camp. They ride the bus and Peppermint Patty is there saying goodbye. Charlie Brown realizes that most of his friends are going to summer camp with him, making him feel better. Linus is eating a lollipop from the trading post and Rerun wants one and goes until he sees Joe Agate play marbles. He then decides at summer camp that he wants to be a marbles champ. Joe Agate, the bully, decides to play against Rerun on the false pretense of teaching him the game and then cheats him out of all his marbles. Joe Agate tells Rerun that Rerun should be \\"in the big leagues\\" and says everything is for keeps. The devastated Rerun complains to Charlie Brown. Disgusted, Charlie Brown takes responsibility and isolates himself in the boathouse, where Snoopy (as alter ego Joe Cool) instructs him on the game until he becomes skilled enough to win back the marbles from Joe. Meanwhile, back home, Peppermint Patty suspects that Charlie Brown is Marcie's love interest. Her temper flares when Marcie and Charlie Brown go off to camp together while she is stuck in town attending summer school as a result of her poor grades. Marcie's teasing Patty over the telephone about it makes Patty even more jealous. Patty, overcome with envy, hatches a plan to leave town and interrupt Marcie's supposed romance, but when she arrives at camp she learns that nobody has seen Charlie Brown in days. On the last day of camp, everyone tensely watches as Joe and Charlie Brown compete. There, Charlie Brown reveals Joe's unfair ways of playing. This shocks and angers Joe. Initially Joe wins and takes all of Charlie Brown's marbles, but Snoopy has two spares. Joe complains, but Charlie Brown claims \\"my dog, therefore, my marbles\\", which Joe cannot refute. Joe gets one, but then attempts a trick shot and misses. Charlie Brown shoots and wins the last marble, along with Joe's shooter. Charlie Brown makes another bet, if Joe wants his shooter back, they should play for all the marbles. Joe asks why he should agree to such a lopsided deal, because Charlie Brown only has three marbles and Joe has hundreds. Charlie Brown says that if he misses a single shot, no matter how much he has won, Joe gets all the marbles. Joe, feeling unbeatable at that bet, agrees. Charlie Brown wins all the marbles in a single turn, crushing Joe, who is forced to give all the marbles back. Joe sadly accuses Charlie Brown for cleaning out all his marbles. Charlie Brown (unfazed by Joe's threat) says he does not want his marbles and offers them back. He says to Joe Agate he can have back his marbles but the only marbles that should be given back to Rerun are the ones he stole from Rerun. But Joe tells Charlie Brown that he won fair and square, concedes all the marbles, and leaves. Triumphant, Charlie Brown returns home and enjoys seeing Lucy's irritation and astonishment learning that he had been a hero. At home, Patty asks Marcie what Marcie did with Charlie Brown at camp while she was away. Marcie explains that there was the Moonlight Walk, before she says, \\"It wasn't really a walk. We just got started before Charles walked into a tree.\\" During the end credits, Snoopy and some birds sleep on tents, while Woodstock roasts a marshmallow and sings.

Production notes The storyline He's a Bully, Charlie Brown was an amalgamation of several different series of Peanuts strips; the \\"Joe Agate\\" storyline originally appeared in the strip in 1995, and the story involving Peppermint Patty sneaking away from summer school to see Charlie Brown at camp was an adaptation of a series of strips from 1989. =Music score= As with It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown and You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown, jazz pianist David Benoit performed and arranged the music score consisting of variations of songs originally performed by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi. Guaraldi composed music scores for the first 16 Peanuts television specials and one feature film (A Boy Named Charlie Brown) before his untimely death in February 1976. All songs written by Vince Guaraldi, except where noted. #\\"Linus and Lucy\\" #\\"Air Music\\" (aka \\"Surfin' Snoopy\\") #\\"Happiness Is\\" #\\"Peppermint Patty\\" #\\"Linus and Lucy\\" (reprise) #\\"The Masked Marvel\\" #\\"Oh, Good Grief\\" (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #\\"The Masked Marvel\\" (reprise) #\\"Happiness Is\\" (reprise) #\\"You're in Love, Charlie Brown\\" #\\"Pebble Beach\\" #\\"The Masked Marvel\\" (second reprise) #Medley: \\"The Masked Marvel\\"/\\"Linus and Lucy\\" #\\"Happiness Is\\" (second reprise) #\\"Linus and Lucy\\" (second reprise) #\\"Oh, Good Grief\\" (reprise) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #\\"Linus and Lucy\\" (third reprise, end credits) Reception This special aired on ABC on 20 November 20, 2006, following a repeat broadcast of 1973's A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.

Small Learning Communities  The school's three Small Learning Communities are named Emerson, Freire, and Montessori. Each has its own teachers, and students mostly attend classes only within their small learning community. Some classes ‚Äì e.g. art, music, Spanish culture, Spanish - are \\"cross-community\\", meaning that students from different communities attend the same class. Montessori and Emerson were once the two biggest communities, having few seniors and an average number of juniors, sophomores, and freshmen, while Freire only had juniors, sophomores and freshmen.

It was a founding member of the Southern Rugby Union, the first country rugby club to be founded, and remains the oldest country club in Australia. The beginning The Goulburn Rugby Club was initially formed in Goulburn on Monday 22 July 1872 at a meeting held at Payten's Commercial Hotel in Goulburn. The driving force behind the club's formation was Valentine Blomfield Riley, a Bowral born former Sydney University player and captain who had moved to Goulburn in 1872 to open a surveying company with his father. It was Riley who called the meeting to found the club, took on the position of secretary and then spread the gospel of rugby throughout the Southern Tablelands and Monaro regions through his travels in his role as a surveyor. Goulburn was the first country rugby club to be founded in Australia and remains the oldest country club in Australia to this day. In 1874 it joined Australia's original rugby body, the Southern Rugby Union, and teams from the various Sydney clubs frequently travelled to Goulburn to play or welcomed Goulburn as visitors to play them. In 1882, fleet-footed Goulburn winger Stuart H Belcher became the first ever country based player to play in the NSW side. His first match was against Queensland and he celebrated his selection with a try. Local competition By 1893 Goulburn was itself a complete branch of the NSW Rugby Union (as the Southern Rugby Union had been known since 1892) and hosted a strong rugby competition of its own. In 1900, the Goulburn representative team, known as Central Southern Rugby Union, played the reigning Sydney premiers, the Glebe Dirty Reds and beat them by 26‚Äì6. While Goulburn pre-dates the Glebe club (later the Drummoyne Rugby Club), Goulburn would later adopt the Dirty Reds title as their own due to the maroon jumper they have worn since 1959. In 1914 a rugby league exhibition match between Annandale and Western Suburbs was played in Goulburn and such was the interest that league clubs were set to form almost instantly. The issue was deemed so important that a town meeting was called with the mayor suggesting that the town could only support one of the rugby codes and should put all of its resources behind that code. Rugby league won although the first world war was to deprive Goulburn of both codes. Rugby took a while to find its feet in all towns after the war and the same was true for Goulburn. There were several starts in the 1920s and 1930s, and by 1939 we had grown back into a Goulburn-based competition. The best players from that side played a Canberra rep side and beat them by 30‚Äì10 but then war came to knock us over again. Again, it took a while to get started after the war with a few more false starts but things were up and running again in the fifties. The club was operating with limited success in 1952 and in 1953 there was again a Goulburn-based competition but midway through 1954 it folded again. In 1957 Goulburn was back in the ACT competition, and lost to Royals in the Canberra Cup grand final. Current incarnation In 1957, the Goulburn Rugby Union Football Club was officially reformed. It played with one side, then in 1959 two sides and in 1967 consisted of three grades. From 1957 until 1973 Goulburn played in the ACT competition. From 1974 until 1978 it competed in the now defunct Southern Tablelands Rugby competition, which was for the latter part of that period headquartered in Goulburn. From 1979 until 1982 Goulburn played in the Illawarra competition, before returning to the ACT from 1983 to 1985. In 1986 it was back to the Illawarra where Goulburn stayed until 1989, before finally moving to its current home, the Monaro Rugby competition. Despite numerous grand final appearances, premierships have been elusive. There were no premierships in the 50s and 60s but the club's most successful period wasn't far off. During the period Goulburn played in the Southern Tablelands competition they won four successive first grade premierships ('74, '75, '76, '77) with a handful of premierships in reserves and Colts at the same time. In 1981, the Reds won the Ilawarra reserve grade grand final against arch enemies Vikings and Goulburn's next piece of grand final silverware came its way in 1992 when third grade beat Canberra Uni. In 2007 Goulburn finally climbed to the top of the mountain again with a first grade grand final win over Tuggeranong and a reserve grade victory over Royals, both at Poidevin Oval. First grade made it back to back titles in 2008 when they beat Cooma, also at Poidevin Oval and made it three in a row in 2009 with a last gasp win against ADFA. All three grand finals were under the coaching of Matt O'Rourke who had begun his association with the Goulburn club in 1986 as a player. In 1996 the club officially christened and opened Poidevin Oval, the main ground at Goulburn Rugby Park that had been owned through Rugby Park Trust since the early '70s, and then in 2011 the club opened its new expanded clubhouse. Goulburn Rugby Union Football Club now operates teams across all ages and genders, starting with the Fizzy Reds competition (Under 6 ‚Äì Under 12), the Tablelands Reds (Under 13 ‚Äì Under 18), Dirty Reds (senior first and second grade teams), Fermented Reds (Over 35s) and Flirty Reds (women's team). Representative players Among Goulburn's greatest representative players are such names as Simon Poidevin, Peter Lucas, John Klem, John Langford, Geoff Richardson, Warwick Watkins, Bruce Bailey, Lars Hedberg, Ken Player, John Shiel, Vince Fester, Gordon Cabot, Paul Southwell, Garry Brims, and Bruce Blackley.

The drawn molecules are in their neutral forms and do not fully correspond to their presented names. Humans can not synthesize all of these amino acids. Amino acid synthesis is the set of biochemical processes (metabolic pathways) by which the amino acids are produced. The substrates for these processes are various compounds in the organism's diet or growth media. Not all organisms are able to synthesize all amino acids. For example, humans can only synthesize 11 of the 20 standard amino acids (a.k.a. non-essential amino acid), and in time of accelerated growth, histidine can be considered an essential amino acid.  From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways  Of the basic set of twenty amino acids (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize eight. In addition, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, histidine, proline, serine, and tyrosine are considered conditionally essential, meaning they are not normally required in the diet but must be supplied exogenously to specific populations that do not synthesize it in adequate amounts. For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called essential amino acids. Nonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids are quite simple. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of Œ±-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid. The pathways for the biosynthesis of essential amino acids are much more complex than those for the nonessential ones. Cortisol inhibits protein synthesis. Œ±-Ketoglutarates: glutamate, glutamine, proline, arginine  Most amino acids are synthesized from Œ±-ketoacids, and later transaminated from another amino acid, usually glutamate. The enzyme involved in this reaction is an aminotransferase. : Œ±-ketoacid + glutamate ‚áÑ amino acid + Œ±-ketoglutarate Glutamate itself is formed by amination of Œ±-ketoglutarate: : Œ±-ketoglutarate + ‚áÑ glutamate The Œ±-ketoglutarate family of amino acid synthesis (synthesis of glutamate, glutamine, proline and arginine) begins with Œ±-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the Citric Acid Cycle. The concentration of Œ±-ketoglutarate is dependent on the activity and metabolism within the cell along with the regulation of enzymatic activity. In E. coli citrate synthase, the enzyme involved in the condensation reaction initiating the Citric Acid Cycle is strongly inhibited by Œ±-ketoglutarate feedback inhibition and can be inhibited by DPNH as well high concentrations of ATP. This is one of the initial regulations of the Œ±-ketoglutarate family of amino acid synthesis. The regulation of the synthesis of glutamate from Œ±-ketoglutarate is subject to regulatory control of the Citric Acid Cycle as well as mass action dependent on the concentrations of reactants involved due to the reversible nature of the transamination and glutamate dehydrogenase reactions. The conversion of glutamate to glutamine is regulated by glutamine synthetase (GS) and is a key step in nitrogen metabolism. This enzyme is regulated by at least four different mechanisms: 1. Repression and depression due to nitrogen levels; 2. Activation and inactivation due to enzymatic forms (taut and relaxed); 3. Cumulative feedback inhibition through end product metabolites; and 4. Alterations of the enzyme due to adenylation and deadenylation. In rich nitrogenous media or growth conditions containing high quantities of ammonia there is a low level of GS, whereas in limiting quantities of ammonia the specific activity of the enzyme is 20-fold higher. The confirmation of the enzyme plays a role in regulation depending on if GS is in the taut or relaxed form. The taut form of GS is fully active but, the removal of manganese converts the enzyme to the relaxed state. The specific conformational state occurs based on the binding of specific divalent cations and is also related to adenylation. The feedback inhibition of GS is due to a cumulative feedback due to several metabolites including L-tryptophan, L-histidine, AMP, CTP, glucosamine-6-phosphate and carbamyl phosphate, alanine, and glycine. An excess of any one product does not individually inhibit the enzyme but a combination or accumulation of all the end products have a strong inhibitory effect on the synthesis of glutamine. Glutamine synthase activity is also inhibited via adenylation. The adenylation activity is catalyzed by the bifunctional adenylyltransferase/adenylyl removal (AT/AR) enzyme. Glutamine and a regulatory protein called PII act together to stimulate adenylation. The regulation of proline biosynthesis can depend on the initial controlling step through negative feedback inhibition. In E. coli, proline allosterically inhibits Glutamate 5-kinase which catalyzes the reaction from L-glutamate to an unstable intermediate L-Œ≥-Glutamyl phosphate. Arginine synthesis also utilizes negative feedback as well as repression through a repressor encoded by the gene argR. The gene product of argR, ArgR an aporepressor, and arginine as a corepressor affect the operon of arginine biosynthesis. The degree of repression is determined by the concentrations of the repressor protein and corepressor level. Erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate: phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan  Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, the aromatic amino acids, arise from chorismate. The first step, condensation of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate (DAHP) from PEP/E4P, uses three isoenzymes AroF, AroG, and AroH. Each one of these has its synthesis regulated from tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively. The rest of the enzymes in the common pathway (conversion of DAHP to chorismate) appear to be synthesized constitutively, except for shikimate kinase, which can be inhibited by shikimate through linear mixed-type inhibition. Tyrosine and phenylalanine are biosynthesized from prephenate, which is converted to an amino acid-specific intermediate. This process is mediated by a phenylalanine (PheA) or tyrosine (TyrA) specific chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase. PheA uses a simple dehydrogenase to convert prephenate to phenylpyruvate, while TyrA uses a NAD-dependent dehydrogenase to make 4-hydroxylphenylpyruvate. Both PheA and TyrA are feedback inhibited by their respective amino acids. Tyrosine can also be inhibited at the transcriptional level by the TyrR repressor. TyrR binds to the TyrR boxes on the operon near the promoter of the gene that it wants to repress. Tryptophan biosynthesis involves conversion of chorismate to anthranilate using anthranilate synthase. This enzyme requires either glutamine as the amino group donor or ammonia itself. Anthranilate synthase is regulated by the gene products of trpE and trpG. trpE encodes the first subunit, which binds to chorismate and moves the amino group from the donor to chorismate. trpG encodes the second subunit, which facilitates the transfer of the amino group from glutamine. Anthranilate synthase is also regulated by feedback inhibition: tryptophan is a co-repressor to the TrpR repressor.  Oxaloacetate/aspartate: lysine, asparagine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine The oxaloacetate/aspartate family of amino acids is composed of lysine, asparagine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine. Aspartate can be converted into lysine, asparagine, methionine and threonine. Threonine also gives rise to isoleucine. The associated enzymes are subject to regulation via feedback inhibition and/or repression at the genetic level. As is typical in highly branched metabolic pathways, additional regulation at each branch point of the pathway. This type of regulatory scheme allows control over the total flux of the aspartate pathway in addition to the total flux of individual amino acids. The aspartate pathway uses L-aspartic acid as the precursor for the biosynthesis of one fourth of the building block amino acids. = Aspartate = The biosynthesis of aspartate is frequently involves the transamination of oxaloacetate. The enzyme aspartokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, can be broken up into 3 isozymes, AK-I, II and III. AK-I is feed-back inhibited by threonine, while AK-II and III are inhibited by lysine. As a sidenote, AK-III catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartic acid that is the committed step in this biosynthetic pathway. Aspartate kinase becomes downregulated by the presence of threonine or lysine. = Lysine = Lysine is synthesized from aspartate via the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway. The initial two stages of the DAP pathway are catalyzed by aspartokinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. These enzymes play a key role in the biosynthesis of lysine, threonine, and methionine. There are two bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenases, ThrA and MetL, in addition to a monofunctional aspartokinase, LysC. Transcription of aspartokinase genes is regulated by concentrations of the subsequently produced amino acids, lysine, threonine, and methionine. The higher these amino acids concentrations, the less the gene is transcribed. ThrA and LysC are also feed-back inhibited by threonine and lysine. Finally, DAP decarboxylase LysA mediates the last step of the lysine synthesis and is common for all studied bacterial species. The formation of aspartate kinase (AK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, is also inhibited by both lysine and threonine, which prevents the formation of the amino acids derived from aspartate. Additionally, high lysine concentrations inhibit the activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHPS). So, in addition to inhibiting the first enzyme of the aspartate families biosynthetic pathway, lysine also inhibits the activity of the first enzyme after the branch point, i.e. the enzyme that is specific for lysine's own synthesis. = Asparagine = The biosynthesis of asparagine originates with aspartate using a transaminase enzyme. The enzyme asparagine synthetase produces asparagine, AMP, glutamate, and pyrophosphate from aspartate, glutamine, and ATP. In the asparagine synthetase reaction, ATP is used to activate aspartate, forming Œ≤-aspartyl-AMP. Glutamine donates an ammonium group, which reacts with Œ≤-aspartyl-AMP to form asparagine and free AMP. The biosynthesis of aspartate and asparagine from oxaloacetate. Two asparagine synthetases are found in bacteria. Both are referred to as the AsnC protein. They are coded for by the genes AsnA and AsnB. AsnC is autogenously regulated, which is where the product of a structural gene regulates the expression of the operon in which the genes reside. The stimulating effect of AsnC on AsnA transcription is downregulated by asparagine. However, the autoregulation of AsnC is not affected by asparagine. = Methionine = Biosysnthesis by the transsulfuration pathway starts with aspartic acid. Relevant enzymes include aspartokinase, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, homoserine dehydrogenase, homoserine O-transsuccinylase, cystathionine-Œ≥-synthase, Cystathionine-Œ≤-lyase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine‚Äîhomocysteine S-methyltransferase.) Methionine biosynthesis is subject to tight regulation. The repressor protein MetJ, in cooperation with the corepressor protein S-adenosyl-methionine, mediates the repression of methionine's biosynthesis. The regulator MetR is required for MetE and MetH gene expression and functions as a transactivator of transcription for these genes. MetR transcriptional activity is regulated by homocystein, which is the metabolic precursor of methionine. It is also known that vitamin B12 can repress MetE gene expression, which is mediated by the MetH holoenzyme. = Threonine = In plants and microorganisms, threonine is synthesized from aspartic acid via Œ±-aspartyl-semialdehyde and homoserine. Homoserine undergoes O-phosphorylation; this phosphate ester undergoes hydrolysis concomitant with relocation of the OH group. Enzymes involved in a typical biosynthesis of threonine include aspartokinase, Œ≤-aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, homoserine dehydrogenase, homoserine kinase, threonine synthase. The biosynthesis of threonine is regulated via allosteric regulation of its precursor, homoserine, by structurally altering the enzyme homoserine dehydrogenase. This reaction occurs at a key branch point in the pathway, with the substrate homoserine serving as the precursor for the biosynthesis of lysine, methionine, threonin and isoleucine. High levels of threonine result in low levels of homoserine synthesis. The synthesis of aspartate kinase (AK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, is feed-back inhibited by lysine, isoleucine, and threonine, which prevents the synthesis of the amino acids derived from aspartate. So, in addition to inhibiting the first enzyme of the aspartate families biosynthetic pathway, threonine also inhibits the activity of the first enzyme after the branch point, i.e. the enzyme that is specific for threonine's own synthesis. = Isoleucine = In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is biosynthesized from pyruvic acid and alpha-ketoglutarate. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, dihydroxyacid dehydratase, and Valine aminotransferase. In terms of regulation, the enzymes threonine deaminase, dihydroxy acid dehydrase, and transaminase are controlled by end-product regulation. i.e. the presence of isoleucine will downregulate threonine biosynthesis. High concentrations of isoleucine also result in the downregulation of aspartate's conversion into the aspartyl-phosphate intermediate, hence halting further biosynthesis of lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine.  Ribose 5-phosphates: histidine  The synthesis of histidine in E. coli is a complex pathway involving several enzymes. Synthesis begins with phosphorylation of 5-phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate (PRPP), catalyzed by ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. Phosphoribosyl-ATP converts to phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP). His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form D-erythro- imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes L-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of L-histidinol to form L-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, L-histidinal is converted to L-histidine. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms. HisG ‚Üí HisE/HisI ‚Üí HisA ‚Üí HisH ‚Üí HisF ‚Üí HisB ‚Üí HisC ‚Üí HisB ‚Üí HisD (HisE/I and HisB are both bifunctional enzymes) The enzymes are coded for on the his operon. This operon has a distinct block of the leader sequence, called block 1: Met-Thr-Arg-Val- Gln-Phe-Lys-His-His-His-His-His-His-His-Pro-Asp This leader sequence is important for the regulation of histidine in E. coli. The his operon operates under a system of coordinated regulation where all the gene products will be repressed or depressed equally. The main factor in the repression or derepression of histidine synthesis is the concentration of histidine charged tRNAs. The regulation of histidine is actually quite simple considering the complexity of its biosynthesis pathway and, it closely resembles regulation of tryptophan. In this system the full leader sequence has 4 blocks of complementary strands that can form hairpin loops structures. Block one, shown above, is the key to regulation. When histidine charged tRNA levels are low in the cell the ribosome will stall at the string of His residues in block 1. This stalling of the ribosome will allow complementary strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin loop. The loop formed by strands 2 and 3 forms an anti-terminator and translation of the his genes will continue and histidine will be produced. However, when histidine charged tRNA levels are high the ribosome will not stall at block 1, this will not allow strands 2 and 3 to form a hairpin. Instead strands 3 and 4 will form a hairpin loop further downstream of the ribosome. The hairpin loop formed by strands 3 and 4 is a terminating loop, when the ribosome comes into contact with the loop, it will be ‚Äúknocked off‚Äù the transcript. When the ribosome is removed the his genes will not be translated and histidine will not be produced by the cell. 3-Phosphoglycerates: serine, glycine, cysteine  = Serine = Serine is the first amino acid in this family to be produced; it is then modified to produce both glycine and cysteine (and many other biologically important molecules). Serine is formed from 3-phosphoglycerate in the following pathway: 3-phosphoglycerate ‚Üí phosphohydroxyl-pyruvate ‚Üí phosphoserine ‚Üí serine The conversion from 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphohydroxyl-pyruvate is achieved by the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. This enzyme is the key regulatory step in this pathway. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase is regulated by the concentration of serine in the cell. At high concentrations this enzyme will be inactive and serine will not be produced. At low concentrations of serine the enzyme will be fully active and serine will be produced by the bacterium. Since serine is the first amino acid produced in this family both glycine and cysteine will be regulated by the available concentration of serine in the cell. = Glycine = Glycine is biosynthesized from serine, catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). The enzyme effectively replaces a hydroxymethyl group with a hydrogen atom. SHMT is coded by the gene glyA. The regulation of glyA is complex and is known to incorporate serine, glycine, methionine, purines, thymine, and folates, The full mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The methionine gene product MetR and the methionine intermediate homocysteine are known to positively regulate glyA. Homocysteine is a coactivator of glyA and must act in concert with MetR. On the other hand, PurR, a protein which plays a role in purine synthesis and S-adeno- sylmethionine are known to down regulate glyA. PurR binds directly to the control region of glyA and effectively turns the gene off so that glycine will not be produced by the bacterium. = Cysteine = The genes required for the synthesis of cysteine are coded for on the cys regulon. The integration of sulfur is positively regulated by CysB. Effective inducers of this regulon are N-acetyl-serine (NAS) and very small amounts of reduced sulfur. CysB functions by binding to DNA half sites on the cys regulon. These half sites differ in quantity and arrangement depending on the promoter of interest. There is however one half site that is conserved. It lies just upstream of the -35 site of the promoter. There are also multiple accessory sites depending on the promoter. In the absence of the inducer, NAS, CysB will bind the DNA and cover many of the accessory half sites. Without the accessory half sites the regulon cannot be transcribed and cysteine will not be produced. It is believed that the presence of NAS causes CysB to undergo a conformational change. This conformational change allows CysB to bind properly to all the half sites and causes the recruitment of the RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase will then transcribe the cys regulon and cysteine will be produced. Further regulation is required for this pathway, however. CysB can down regulate its own transcription by binding to its own DNA sequence and blocking the RNA polymerase. In this case NAS will act to disallow the binding of CysB to its own DNA sequence. OAS is a precursor of NAS, cysteine itself can inhibit CysE which functions to create OAS. Without the necessary OAS, NAS will not be produced and cysteine will not be produced. There are two other negative regulators of cysteine. These are the molecules sulfide and thiosulfate, they act to bind to CysB and they compete with NAS for the binding of CysB.  Pyruvate: alanine, valine, and leucine  Pyruvate, the end result of glycolysis, can feed into both the TCA cycle and fermentation processes. Reactions beginning with either one or two molecules of pyruvate lead to the synthesis of alanine, valine, and leucine. Feedback inhibition of final products is the main method of inhibition, and, in E. coli, the ilvEDA operon also plays a part in this regulation. = Alanine = Alanine is produced by the transamination of one molecule of pyruvate using two alternate steps: 1) conversion of glutamate to Œ±-ketoglutarate using a glutamate-alanine transaminase, and 2) conversion of valine to Œ±-ketoisovalerate via Transaminase C. Not much is known about the regulation of alanine synthesis. The only definite method is the bacterium's ability to repress Transaminase C activity by either valine or leucine (see ilvEDA operon). Other than that, alanine biosynthesis does not seem to be regulated. = Valine = Valine is produced by a four-enzyme pathway. It begins with the condensation of two equivalents of pyruvate catalyzed by acetohydroxy acid synthase yielding Œ±-acetolactate. The second step involves the NADPH+-dependent reduction of Œ±-acetolactate and migration of methyl groups to produce Œ±, Œ≤-dihydroxyisovalerate. This is catalyzed by acetohydroxy isomeroreductase. The third step is the dehydration of Œ±, Œ≤-dihydroxyisovalerate catalyzed by dihydroxy acid dehydrase. In the fourth and final step, the resulting Œ±-ketoisovalerate undergoes transamination catalyzed either by an alanine- valine transaminase or a glutamate-valine transaminase. Valine biosynthesis is subject to feedback inhibition in the production of acetohydroxy acid synthase. = Leucine = The leucine synthesis pathway diverges from the valine pathway beginning with Œ±-ketoisovalerate. Œ±-Isopropylmalate synthase catalyzes this condensation with acetyl CoA to produce Œ±-isopropylmalate. An isomerase converts Œ±-isopropylmalate to Œ≤-isopropylmalate. The third step is the NAD+-dependent oxidation of Œ≤-isopropylmalate catalyzed by a dehydrogenase. The final step is the transamination of the Œ±-ketoisocaproate by the action of a glutamate-leucine transaminase. Leucine, like valine, regulates the first step of its pathway by inhibiting the action of the Œ±-Isopropylmalate synthase. Because leucine is synthesized by a diversion from the valine synthetic pathway, the feedback inhibition of valine on its pathway also can inhibit the synthesis of leucine.  ilvEDA operon  The genes that encode both the dihydroxy acid dehydrase used in the creation of Œ±-ketoisovalerate and Transaminase E, as well as other enzymes are encoded on the ilvEDA operon. This operon is bound and inactivated by valine, leucine, and isoleucine. (Isoleucine is not a direct derivative of pyruvate, but is produced by the use of many of the same enzymes used to produce valine and, indirectly, leucine.) When one of these amino acids is limited, the gene furthest from the amino-acid binding site of this operon can be transcribed. When a second of these amino acids is limited, the next-closest gene to the binding site can be transcribed, and so forth. Commercial syntheses of amino acids The commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source. Some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates. 2-Aminothiazoline-4-carboxylic acid is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of L-cysteine for example. Aspartic acid is produced by the addition of ammonia to fumarate using a lyase.

In this model several Maxwell elements are assembled in parallel. It takes into account that the relaxation does not occur at a single time, but in a set of times.

Astronomy Explorer-B (RAE-B)) was a satellite launched on June 10, 1973, for long wave radio astronomy research. It had four X-shaped antenna elements, which made it one of the largest spacecraft ever built.  Launch  Explorer 49 was launched after the termination of the Apollo program, and although it did not examine the Moon directly, it became the last American lunar orbital mission until the launch of Clementine spacecraft in 1994. It was launched on June 10, 1973, 14:13:00 UTC in the Rocket Delta 1913 from the Launch site Cape Canaveral LC-17B.  Orbit  This mission was the second of a pair of Radio Astronomy Explorer (RAE) satellites, Explorer 38 or RAE-A being the first. Explorer 49 was placed into lunar orbit to provide radio astronomical measurements of the planets, the Sun, and the galaxy over the frequency range of 25 kHz to 13.1 MHz. Since the spacecraft's design used gravity gradient booms, the lumpy lunar gravity field was a problem for the mission scientists.  Mission  Explorer 49 was placed in lunar orbit to record radio measurements from 25 kHz to 13.1 MHz of the Milky Way galaxy. Explorer 49 was placed in to lunar orbit so that radio waves from Earth would not be as big of an interference as Explorer 38 had discovered.http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1975A%26A....40..365A/0000368.000.html  Experiments  The principal investigator for all the experiments was Dr. Robert G. Stone. # Step Frequency Radiometers: Explorer 49 was equipped with two Ryle-Vonberg (RV) receivers one on the upper V-antenna and the other on the lower V-antenna. The radiometers were designed to measure at nine frequencies from .45 to 9.18 MHz.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-039A-01 # Rapid-Burst Receivers: Explorer 49 had three rapid burst receivers, one on the upper V-antenna one the lower V-antenna and the third on the middle dipole antenna. The Burst Receivers were composed of a pair of IF Amplifiers and detectors one of the pair was used for back up. They detected on 32 channels between 25 kHz and 13.1 MHz.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-039A-02 # Impedance Probe: This was to test the engineering to calibrate the upper V-antenna.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experiment/display.action?id=1973-039A-03 Data Data were returned to Earth via either a low-power UHF/(400 MHz) transmitter, in real time, or stored in an onboard tape recorder and transmitted to Earth via a high-power UHF transmitter (400 MHz). Two tape recorders provided backup storage.https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1973-039A  Defects  The third burst receiver on the dipole antenna failed after the first week, and no data resulted from the receiver.http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1975A%26A....40..365A/0000371.000.html A mechanical flaw in the lower V-antenna caused the leg to only deploy to a length of instead of .

Orbit Originally intended for a lunar orbit, mission controllers worried that the spacecraft's trajectory was too fast to guarantee lunar capture. Consequently, mission managers opted for a backup plan of placing the craft into an eccentric Earth orbit with a perigee of 265,679 km and an apogee of 480,762 km -- still reaching distances beyond the Moon's orbit. Despite not attaining the intended lunar orbit, the mission met many of its original goals in exploring solar wind, interplanetary plasma, and solar X-rays. Principal investigator James Van Allen used electron and proton detectors aboard the spacecraft to investigate charged particle and X-ray activity. Astrophysicists N. U. Crooker, Joan Feynman, and J.

MacKendrick was educated at Harvard University (1934 B.A., summa cum laude; 1937 M.A.; 1938 Ph.D.) and Balliol College, Oxford, after which he taught at Phillips Academy for some years. Future United States President George H.W. Bush was a student of MacKendrick's while he taught at Phillips Academy.Professor MacKendrick recounted this to a Latin course at the University of Wisconsin attended by the author of this note. He joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and served from 1941‚Äì45. He taught at Harvard in 1946 and then moved to University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as Assistant Professor of Classics where he taught for six years. MacKendrick was named a Professor of Classics in 1952 and in 1975, the Lily Ross Taylor Professor of Classics. In all, he taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1946 to 1984. In 1952, he worked with Herbert M. Howe on the publication of Classics in Translation, an anthology of selections by ancient Greek and Roman writers. In 1958, two books followed: The Ancient World, co- authored with Vincent M. Scramuzza and The Roman Mind At Work. He is most widely known for a series of books that utilise the discoveries of archeology to reconstruct the histories of particular cultures or civilizations. The first of these, The Mute Stones Speak, surveys the cultures of the Italian peninsula from prehistoric times, with emphasis on the Romans, to the adoption of Christianity as the official religion of the empire in 324 A.D. The Greek Stones Speak then followed in 1962. Starting with the Troy and Heinrich Schliemann's excavations, the reader is told of accounts of excavations of major centers of the Hellenic world, including the story of Michael Ventris' decipherment of Linear B. Several additional titles appeared in this series, and by 1980 it had surveyed regions and cultures of almost the entire area of the Roman Empire. Professor MacKendrick had retired from teaching in 1984.

It consists of a prologue and two articles: the first one was written in 1944 and appeared in number 115 of the review Sur; the second, written in 1946, is a rework of the first. Borges comments that he did not combine the two texts into one, as the reading of two analogous texts might facilitate the comprehension of an indocile subject. Just as George Berkeley denies that there is an object existing independently of our perception of it, and David Hume denies that there is a subject apart from a mere recollection of sensations, Borges tries to demonstrate that there is no time. He proceeds on the assumption that if \\"man\\" is reduced, as according to Hume, to a collection of sensations, a single repeated perception, either in one man's life or in the experience of two different men, suffices to prove that time is a fallacy, since this repetition will destroy its linear sequence.

Here they performed guard and garrison duty details, being sent daily to guard railroad trains to Nashville. Colonel Cobb was appointed commander of the post and Lieutenant Colonel Paine took command of the regiment. At that time vast amounts of army supplies of all kinds were passing through Johnsonville to Nashville, being brought up the Tennessee on transports and then shipped by rail. November 4 the rebels attacked the gun boats below the town, drove them up to Johnsonville, planted a six-gun battery and opened fire upon the place and the boats. The officers of the latter, with reason or without reason, deemed it necessary to abandon and burn them. Soon after the transports barges and Government buildings were also fired by the federals and property worth several millions of dollars was destroyed to prevent its falling into the enemy's hands. The burning of so many boats and buildings was a conflagration indescribably grand, which added to the explosion of ammunition upon the boats and in the depot and the roar of artillery from the combatants between whom a battle, meanwhile, was raging, produced a terrific scene. On the morning of the 5th, the firing was renewed but the rebels soon withdrew. During the engagement the Forty-Third lay in the trenches protected by earth-works from the enemy's shot, being unable to aid in the battle because it was wholly an artillery fight. They had two men killed and one wounded. November 30, Johnsonville was evacuated and the troops ordered to move with all possible dispatch to Nashville to resist Hood. Marching by day and night in an almost unbroken wilderness, through deep mud and drenching rains, and guarding an immense train, they learned on the third day that they were cut off from Nashville. They were then ordered to turn toward Clarksville which they reached December 5 and there encamped until the 28th. At that date they embarked for Nashville and January 1, 1865, moved south by rail to Decherd, a station on the road to Chattanooga. Here six companies encamped and four, under command of Major Brightman, were detached to guard the Elk River bridge. The regiment remained at these points, guarding the railroad and awing the guerrillas of the country until the close of the war. While at Decherd they laid out a cemetery for their own and other deceased soldiers, erected a monument with a suitable inscription in raised letters and dedicated all with solemn religious services conducted by their chaplain. They were called to bury many of their number in Tennessee. Early in June the regiment moved to Nashville and on the 24th were mustered out. They soon after returned to Milwaukee where they were paid and disbanded. Colonel Cobb was brevetted brigadier general for meritorious services during the war. Lieutenant Colonel Paine was constrained in consequence of the death of a brother, to resign a short time before the discharge of the regiment. He was in command during most of their service, Colonel Cobb being engaged on detached duty. The soldiers were deeply affected when it was announced that he was to leave. He united kindness and firmness in discipline. It is the unanimous testimony of the officers of the regiment that never did the humblest soldier, however great his delinquency, receive from Lieutenant Colonel Paine an unkind or ungentlemanly word. \\"Without ostentation and with great singleness of purpose he devoted himself to the welfare of his regiment and the good of the service. Conceding nothing to ambition, nothing to any personal consideration, he moved straight wherever duty led undeterred by censure and unmoved by applause anxious only to be right.\\" Rarely has the service been blessed with an officer of so pure morals and so sincere a purpose. The only new appointments that appear the muster-out roster are the following: John E. Davis, Adjutant; C. C. Hayes, Surgeon; Henry H. Ruger, First Assistant Surgeon; G. Witter, First Lieutenant of Company E, and Alvin F. Clark of Company F; James H. McHenry, Second Lieutenant of Company A., and George P. Gennett, of Company G.

Located in the north-eastern part of the city, it was originally constructed during the 1860s as a terminal station. In recent years, the station has been redeveloped to better serve as a hub for the Italian high- speed rail services. The station is connected to Rome's Metro line B at Tiburtina metro station, as well as to local bus services via an adjacent bus depot while private vehicle users are provided with more than 100,000 spaces across multiple on-site car parks. Roma Tiburtina was originally opened in 1866, only three years after the first (temporary) Roma Termini. It was originally known as Portonaccio station, but all usage of this name has since been depreciated. During the 1930s, work was undertaken to expand the station, this included the development of a new main building. A rebuild was undertaken shortly after the end of the Second World War as a result of damage sustained from aerial bombing missions. During 1990, an adjoining metro station was opened, providing further means of local transit for passengers. Since the late 1990s, Roma Tiburtina station has been managed by Grandi Stazioni, a wholly owned entity of the Italian state railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. Between 2007 and 2011, Roma Tiburtina was subject to an extensive redevelopment programme, during which much of the original station building and infrastructure were demolished and replaced, and new on-site facilities established. A major advantage of the redesigned station in terms of high- speed services is that it is a through station, meaning trains travelling from Turin/Milan to Naples/Salerno do not have any need to turn around. Officially inaugurated in November 2011, the new facility is dedicated to the traditional regional trains and to the high-speed rail services on the Milan-Naples line. The new station is expected to reach a daily ridership of over 450,000 by 2015. The station is served by 140 high-speed trains and 290 regional trains every day. History =Construction and early operations= What would later become known as Roma Tiburtina station was first opened in 1866, only three years after the opening of Rome's first major railway station, Roma Termini. Located in the eastern portion of the city, the station was one of the largest railway stations to have ever been constructed in Italy. During its early years, the station was originally known as Portonaccio.\\"About us.\\" stazioneromatiburtina.it, Retrieved: 30 June 2018. During the 1930s, it was decided to expand the station via the construction of a new main building. As a result of repeated aerial bombardments of the city during the Second World War, the station suffered extensive damage, including to the recently completed main building. Accordingly, this building would be later rebuilt, albeit in a simplified configuration, during the immediate post-war years. Since the late 1990s, Roma Tiburtina station has been managed by Grandi Stazioni, a wholly owned entity of the Italian state railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane. While Roma Tiburtina station is regarded as being a heavily trafficked transit hub, even greater passenger numbers have been recorded at the more centrally located Termini.\\"Rome Termini Railway Station.\\" rome.net, Retrieved: 30 June 2018. In October 2003, Sally Baldwin, a visiting British University professor, was killed at the station when an escalator fell apart and a hole suddenly appeared beneath her feet.Bradshaw, Jonathan. \\"Sally Baldwin.\\" The Guardian, 31 October 2003. A local train driver, 38, who had attempted to rescue her also lost a leg; a third person was also seriously injured from falling into the mechanism. An inquiry was launched the next day by local magistrates into the incident; the escalator had been subject to recent maintenance work and safeguards intended to prevent its activation did not apparently work. =Redeveloped station= During summer 2004, it was announced that plans were prepared for a major upgrade of the station; a major goal of the renovations and redevelop work was to properly establish Roma Tiburtina as a capable transport hub for the expanding Italian high speed rail services.\\"Roma Tiburtina Railway Station, Rome.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 30 June 2018. At this point, work was scheduled to commence in 2007 and the project was expected to have a total cost of ‚Ç¨155 million. The project was only one element of the wider Trans-European Transport Network initiative conducted by the European Union. The redeveloped station was designed by architect Paolo Desideri, while the responsibility for managing both the design and construction phases resided with the Gemmo Railway Division,\\"M&E; systems (including low current) made by Gemmo Company.\\" Gemmo SpA, 28 November 2011. which also administered electrical and mechanical systems as well as the project's technical and financial aspects.

It is an enclosed glazed parallelepiped structure, with a length of 240 metres, a width of 50 metres, and suspended 9 metres above ground level. The interior space is divided into eight separate rooms suspended from the roof. The suspension of the main structure offers several advantages, including a greater level of isolation from the noise and vibration generated by the passage of trains beneath it. The ground level platforms are connected to the suspended rooms above via an assortment of 29 escalators and 52 elevators. The local railway infrastructure was also extensively changed, a total of 20 new high speed and high capacity tracks were laid in the station area, along with improvements to security systems and miscellaneous passenger-facing service infrastructure. The adjacent squares located at either side of the entrances to the station were intentionally developed to accommodate various new areas, including a railway office, a new metro line, a bus terminal, a shopping centre, offices and parking spaces; reportedly, in excess of 100,000 parking spaces were added along with various private access roads. By December 2010, the northern tracks and rail yard had been fully constructed and associated control equipment installed in a centralised traffic control center. Overhead view across multiple tracks and platforms at Roma Tiburtina, 2011 In the early hours of 24 July 2011, a fire broke out in the relay room on the west side of the station. As a result, serious and unavoidable disruption to services occurred, including a temporary partial closure of Metro line B, between Castro Pretorio and Monti Tiburtini. The fire damaged equipment within the relay room, rendering the majority of controls for nearby tracks and traffic signals alike unusable, leaving a vital part of the Italian rail network disabled; reportedly, this led to significant train delays throughout the country. Furthermore, the damage to the structure had reportedly rendered the station building in danger of collapse; due to the impact of the fire, further problems and service delays that occurred for many months afterwards were attributed to the accident. On 28 November 2011, following three years of construction work, the new station was officially inaugurated and dedicated to Cavour. By the end of the project, the total construction costs had almost doubled from the original projected figure to around ‚Ç¨330 million. It is believed that roughly 13,400 tonnes of steel and 95,000 cubic metres of concrete was used during the station's construction. The completed station is expected to handle around 300,000 passengers per day.

It is currently known to affect the following breeds American Quarter Horses, American Paint Horses, Warmbloods, Cobs, Dales Ponies, Thoroughbreds, Arabians, New Forest ponies, and a large number of Heavy horse breeds. While incurable, PSSM can be managed with appropriate diet and exercise. There are currently 2 subtypes, known as Type 1 PSSM and Type 2 PSSM. Pathophysiology of glycogen storage disorders and sub-typing of PSSM A representation of glucose molecules linked by Œ±-1,4-glycosidic bonds, with a single Œ±-1,6-glycosidic bond leading to a branch off of the chain. Glycogen is a molecular polymer of glucose (a polysaccharide) used to store energy, and is important for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the blood, as well as for providing energy for skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle contraction. Molecules of glucose are linked into linear chains by Œ±-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Additionally, branches of glucose are formed off of the chain by Œ±-1,6-glycosidic bonds. 2 molecules of glucose are joined into an Œ±-1,4-glycosidic bonds by an enzyme known as glycogen synthase. This bond may be broken by amylase when the body wishes to break down glycogen into glucose for energy. Glycogen branching enzyme is responsible for the required Œ±-1,6-glycosidic bonds needed to start a branch off of these linear chains. Any disruption to this system results in a glycogen storage disease. There are currently 2 subcategories of glycogen storage diseases in horses: Type 1 polysaccharide storage myopathy, glycogen branching enzyme deficiency, and Type 2 polysaccharide storage myopathy. =Type 1 PSSM= Type 1 PSSM is caused by an autosomal dominant genetic mutation known as GSY1. This mutation causes an up-regulation of glycogen synthase, and high levels of glycogen synthase relative to glycogen branching enzyme (GBE). This altered ratio of glycogen synthase to GBE results in glycogen molecules with long chains and few branches, making these molecules somewhat amylase resistant. The GSY1 mutation is associated with altered glucose metabolism (but normal glycogen metabolism), as well as accumulation of high levels of glycogen and abnormal polysaccharide in the muscles of the horse. Additionally, some horses have been shown to have insulin sensitivity, which improves glucose uptake by muscle cells and contributes to excessive glycogen storage that is already elevated secondary to the GSY1 mutation. =Glycogen branching enzyme deficiency= Low levels of glycogen branching enzyme leads to a condition known as glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency. This condition is caused by a mutation of the GBE1 gene responsible for producing the glycogen branching enzyme. Subsequently, glycogen molecules are produced with few branches, which greatly decreasing the number of nonreducing ends, drastically slowing the rate as which the molecule can be synthesized or broken down. This causes low levels of muscle glycogen that is very resistant to amylase. This disease is usually seen in Quarter Horse foals and is fatal. =Type 2 PSSM= Type 2 PSSM is a category for disorders that lead to abnormal deposition of glycogen in the skeletal muscles of the horse that is not due to mutations in GSY1 or GBE1. Presentation The Belgian Draft is one breed with a very high prevalence of PSSM in their population. PSSM is most prevalent in American Quarter Horses and their related breeds (Paint horse, Appaloosa, Appendix Quarter Horse), Draft horse breeds (especially Belgian Draft and Percherons), and Warmblood breeds. The Belgian Draft been shown to have a 36% prevalence of PSSM. Other breeds that have been diagnosed with PSSM include the Arabian, Lipizzaner, Morgan, Mustang, Peruvian Paso, Rocky Mountain Horse, Standardbred, Tennessee Walking Horse, Thoroughbred, and National Show Horse. It has been suggested that the GSY1 mutation provided some benefit to hard working animals with poor-quality diets, and is now damaging members of those \\"thrifty\\" breeds that are managed with moderate to low levels of work and diets high in non-structural carbohydrates. PSSM Type 1 (homozygous or heterozygous for the GSY1 mutation) is more common in Quarter Horses and their related breeds, and draft breeds, while PSSM Type 2 (negative for the GSY1 mutation) is more commonly seen in other breeds, including warmbloods. There is no sex predilection to the disease. Clinical signs Horses with Type 1 PSSM usually appear normal at rest, but show signs of exertional rhabdomyolysis (\\"tying up\\") such as shortened stride, stiffness, firm musculature, sweating, pain or reluctance to exercise, when asked to perform light work. While episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis is one of the most frequent signs associated with affected horses (reported in ~37% of affected animals), other common signs include gait abnormalities, shifting lameness, muscle weakness that may result in an inability to rise, colic-like pain, and muscle fasciculation, atrophy, and/or stiffness (most commonly seen in the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and longissimus muscles). These clinical signs usually first become apparent when the horse is placed into training as a young animal; however, affected horses will show histological changes consistent with muscle damage at one month of age, and may also show elevations in creatine kinase (CK), an enzyme that elevates with muscle damage. Concurrent illness, such as respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, can lead to elevations in CK and potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, even without exercise. Horses with PSSM often have a persistently elevated CK at rest, which differentiates the disease from recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis, in which horses have normal CK concentrations between episodes. =Variability in phenotype and modifying genes= Some affected animals may remain subclinical, others may have mild signs that do not impede athletic performance, while some horses will have clinical signs that prevent any forced exercise. Rarely, horses will die from acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The reason for such variability of phenotype is not fully understood. Temperament, gender, and body type have no effect on degree of clinical signs. However, environmental factors such as diet and exercise, whether the horse is heterozygous or homozygous for the mutated GSY1 allele, and the presence of modifying genes all play a role. Additionally, some affected horses may have PSSM Type 2, which will produce different cellular changes and subsequently different phenotypic effects. One such modifying genes is RYR1, which is responsible for calcium regulation in muscle cells. RYR1 mutation causes malignant hyperthermia, a rare but potentially fatal disorder usually associated with anesthesia. While RYR1 mutation is rare in horses, including the general Quarter Horse population, it is much more common in Quarter Horses with GSY1 mutation. Horses with both mutations are more likely to have a severe PSSM phenotype, including higher levels of blood creatine kinase (CK), more severe exercise intolerance, more severe episodes of rhabdomyolysis (more frequent muscle fasciculations, more frequent episodes that are not associated with exercise, acute death), and poor response to PSSM treatment. Additionally, defects in both GSY1 and the SCNA4 gene, responsible for hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) in Quarter Horses and related breeds, has been found in 14% of Halter horses. A combination of both of these genes can cause severe rhabdomyolysis should the horse become recumbent due to an HYPP attack. Diagnosis A genetic test is available for Type 1 PSSM. This test requires a blood or hair sample, and is less-invasive than muscle biopsy. However, it may be less useful for breeds that are more commonly affected by Type 2 PSSM, such as light horse breeds. Often a muscle biopsy is recommended for horses displaying clinical signs of PSSM but who have negative results for GYS1 mutation. A muscle biopsy may be taken from the semimembranosis or semitendinosis (hamstring) muscles. The biopsy is stained for glycogen, and the intensity of stain uptake in the muscle, as well as the presence of any inclusions, helps to determine the diagnosis of PSSM. This test is the only method for diagnosing Type 2 PSSM. Horses with Type 1 PSSM will usually have between 1.5-2 times the normal levels of glycogen in their skeletal muscle. While abnormalities indicating muscle damage can be seen on histologic sections of muscle as young as 1 month of age, abnormal polysaccharide accumulation may take up to 3 years to develop. Management =Effect on metabolism= Horses with PSSM have elevated levels of muscle glycogen at rest. During exercise, glycogen levels are depleted faster than is seen in unaffected horses, and are reduced down to levels considered normal for a resting non-PSSM horse. This demonstrates that glycogen metabolism is actually normal in these animals. However, PSSM horses synthesize muscle glycogen at double the rate of a normal horse once exercise has ceased, which leads to elevated muscle glycogen. The exact mechanism of abnormal glucose metabolism has not yet been established, but it may have similarities to phosphofructokinase deficiency in humans. Quarter Horse-related breeds with PSSM show insulin sensitivity, which improves glucose uptake by cells, and these horses clear the blood of glucose more quickly after eating than unaffected horses. This provides easy access to glucose by the muscles, which can then use the substrate to produce glycogen. The GYS1 defect, which up- regulates the glycogen synthase enzyme, allows the muscles to use this glucose to rapidly produce glycogen for storage in the muscle. Surprisingly, increased insulin sensitivity is not seen in draft horse breeds. Dietary and exercise manipulation may be used to counteract these metabolic changes. Approximately 50% of horses that adhere to the dietary recommendations, and 90% of horses that adhere to both dietary and exercise recommendations, have few to no episodes of exertional rhabdomyolysis. =Diet= For most horses, diet has a significant impact on the degree of clinical signs. PSSM horses fed diets high in nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), which stimulate insulin secretion, have been shown to have increased severity of rhabdomyolysis with exercise. Current recommendations for horses with PSSM include a low-starch, high-fat diet. Low- starch diets produce low blood glucose and insulin levels after eating, which may reduce the amount of glucose taken up by the muscle cells. High fat diets increase free fatty acid concentrations in the blood, which may promote the use of fat for energy (via free fatty acid oxidation) over glucose metabolism. Horses with the most severe clinical signs often show the greatest improvement on the diet. Dietary recommendations usually include a combination of calorie restriction, reduction of daily NSC content, and an increase in dietary fat. Diet recommendations need to be balanced with the animal's body condition score and exercise level, as it may be beneficial to wait on increasing dietary fat after an obese animal has lost weight. The diet should have <10% of digestible energy coming from NSC, and 15-20% of daily digestible energy coming from fat. =Exercise= Horses with PSSM show fewer clinical signs if their exercise is slowly increased over time (i.e. they are slowly conditioned). Additionally, they are much more likely to develop muscle stiffness and rhabdomyolysis if they are exercised after prolonged stall rest. Horses generally have fewer clinical signs when asked to perform short bouts of work at maximal activity level (anaerobic exercise), although they have difficulty achieving maximal speed and tire faster than unaffected horses. They have more muscle damage when asked to perform lower intensity activity over a longer period of time (aerobic activity), due to an energy deficit in the muscle.

Life Tashawaylennahan was born around 1690 in New Jersey and was a translator and guide for the early settlers of New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the early 18th century. He lived near what is now Stockertown, Pennsylvania and Forks Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania, north of Easton, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley, along the Delaware River. He moved from New Jersey as early as 1733. The Lenape were displaced from their land by the Walking Purchase, but on April 28, 1738 Tatamy was given by John, Thomas and Richard Penn, the descendants of William Penn. Worried that he would be displaced from his land, he formally purchased it in 1741 for 48 pounds, 16 shillings, and 5 pence. This made him the first native-born individual to make a formal purchase of land in Pennsylvania. After the Native Americans were forced to leave the Lehigh Valley, Tatamy petitioned the Pennsylvania Provincial Council for the right to remain on his land. In 1745, Tatamy was the first Native American baptized by David Brainerd. He died in 1760 and around 1780, Tatamy's neighbors, Henry and Matthias Stecher, claimed the property, and transferred it to William Allen. Tatamy's widow was listed on the 1790 United States Census. Land Claim In 2003 two Delaware Indian tribes based in Oklahoma claimed the land once owned by Tatamy.

It has 146 inhabitants. History Early History The village was founded after 1366, when the then Hungarian king Ludovit I gave a nobleman Jakub a forested area near the villages of Starina, Orlov, near the Poprad river, to create a village. History of Legnava under Hungarian Rule In the past, the village had tax ports that belonged to the Bre≈ænovica family. In the documents from the 15th and 16th centuries, the tax ports are mentioned sporadically under the name, \\"Langno\\", the Hungarian variant of the name, other name included, Lagn√≥ and Hossz√∫v√°g√°s. As well as German names such as Legenau and Langhaw. Documents from 1440 show that the village was named, \\"Valasi\\". In 1600, the village consisted of 16 serf houses. At the end of the 16th century, Legnava was a medium-sized municipality with exclusively serf population mostly of Rusyn origin. In the 17th century, most land around the village belonged to the Semsey family. The land was later given to the Szirmay family in the 18th century. A chapel built by Tom√°≈° Szirmay (1760) is located 1 km from the village. By the end of the 19th century, the village had 503 inhabitants, the highest number recorded in the village's history. At that time, the inhabitants made their living mainly by hard labour, such as farming and construction.

Several therapies for it exist, although there is no known cure. The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing- remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several adverse effects, and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different alternative treatments are pursued by many people, despite the fact that there is little supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study. Stem cell therapy is being studied. This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; borderline forms of MS have particular treatments that are excluded.  Acute attacks  Chemical structure of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses. Administration of high doses of intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established efficacy in promoting a faster recovery from disability after an attack. There is however insufficient evidence to indicate any significant impact on long-term disability of corticosteroid treatments. Steroids administered orally have a similar effectiveness and safety profile at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. Consequences of severe attacks which do not respond to corticosteroids might be treated by plasmapheresis.  Disease-modifying treatments  Disease-modifying treatments are expensive and most require frequent (up-to-daily) injections, under the skin or into the muscle. Newer treatments feature intravenous (IV) infusions (shown above) at 1 to 3-month intervals. , several disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Medications approved by the FDA include: interferons beta-1a and beta-1b, three monoclonal antibodies: natalizumab, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, and five immunomodulators: glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate. Siponimod was approved in March 2019. Cladribine was approved in March 2019. Ozanimod was approved in March 2020. Daclizumab, that was once approved, was later withdrawn. =Medications= In 1993, interferon beta-1b was the first drug to ever be approved for MS, being soon followed by interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate. Interferon beta-1a is injected either weekly (intramuscular injection) or three times a week (subcutaneous injection) depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b is injected subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a pegylated form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with the brand name Plegridy, which is available as a subcutaneous injection.Plegridy Prescribing Information Biogen Idec Inc. Plegridy Prescribing Information (August 2014). Retrieved on 31 October 2014 This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks.Peginterferon beta-1a description National Multiple Sclerosis Society (15 August 2014). Retrieved on 27 October 2014 Interferon beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival. Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random polymers of four amino acids which is antigenically similar to the myelin basic protein, a component of the myelin sheath of nerves with which it competes for presentation to T cells . It is injected subcutaneously on a daily basis. Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant also used in cancer chemotherapy which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004. Both are given by intravenous infusion at monthly intervals in the case of natalizumab and every three months in the case of mitoxantrone. In 2010, fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, became the first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing drug), was approved by the FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily. Another oral drug, cladribine, was approved in Russia and Australia in 2010. Its application was rejected by the FDA and EMEA in 2011, due to safety concerns. This led the pharmaceutical to discontinue commercialization and withdraw all marketing applications. In March 2017, ocrelizumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis in adults. It is also used in adults for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Ocrelizumab was approved for use in the European Union in January 2018. In 2019, siponimod and cladribine were approved in the United States for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Siponimod was approved for use in the European Union in January 2020, for the treatment of adults with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Cladribine was approved for use in the European Union in August 2017, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. In March 2020, ozanimod (Zeposia) was approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. In April 2020, monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) was approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing- remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.  Side effects  Injectable medications can produce irritation or bruises at injection site. The bruise depicted was produced by a subcutaneous injection. Irritation zone after injection of glatiramer acetate. Both the interferons and glatiramer acetate are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause skin reactions at the injection site, specially with subcutaneous administration. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation and may include bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, irritation, swelling and in the most extreme cases cutaneous necrosis. They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of use. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons, a subclass of cytokines, are produced in the body during illnesses such as influenza in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons. Glatiramer acetate is generally well tolerated. The most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin problem is a post- injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require additional treatment. Mitoxantrone therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and liver damage; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related cardiac toxicity. Careful adherence to the administration and monitoring guidelines is therefore essential; this includes obtaining an echocardiogram and a complete blood count before treatment to decide whether the therapy is suitable for the patient or the risks are too great. It is recommended that mitoxantrone be discontinued at the first signs of heart damage, infection or liver dysfunction during therapy. Heart problems (mainly systolic dysfunction) appear in over 10% of patients, while leukemia prevalence is 0.8%. Soon after its approval natalizumab was withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare but hazardous neurological condition called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported, all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease- modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled. During clinical trials fingolimod gave rise to side effects such as hypertension and bradycardia, macular edema, elevated liver enzymes or reduction in lymphocite levels. Teriflunomide is considered a very safe drug. Nevertheless, there have been reports of liver failure, and PML. Teriflunomide is also known to be dangerous for fetal development. Most common secondary effects of dimethyl fumarate during clinical trials were flushing and gastrointestinal problems. These problems were generally mild and occurred more frequently during the first month of treatment. While dimethyl fumarate leads to a reduction in white blood cell count and levels should be monitored in patients, there were no reported cases of opportunistic infections during the clinical trials. Moreover, fumaric acid is also used to treat psoriasis, another autoinmune disorder, and there is long term safety data from over 14 years of use without any indication of further dangerous secondary effects. = Clinically isolated syndrome = The earliest clinical presentation of RRMS is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Early treatment can reduce the hazard of conversion to from a first attack to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. However, it is difficult to make firm conclusions about the best treatment, especially regarding the long‚Äêterm benefit and safety of early treatment, given the lack of studies directly comparing disease modifying therapies or long-term monitoring of patient outcomes. = Relapsing-remitting MS = Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. One of the factors related to non-respondance is the presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called \\"rapidly worsening MS\\" are normally non-responders to immunomodulators and are treated with either mitoxantrone or natalizumab. Natalizumab is considered highly effective in terms of relapse rate reduction and halting disability progression, however, it is considered a second-line treatment because of the risk of adverse side-effects. Natalizumab halves the risk of suffering relapses when compared to interferons, having an overall efficacy of over 70%. Mitoxantrone is also highly useful to reduce attacks and disability, but it is generally not considered as a long-term therapy due to its severe cardiac toxicity. There are no official guidelines yet on the use of disease-modifying oral treatments due to their recent development. While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed JC virus antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML. Dimethyl fumarate is potentially one of the most interesting oral drugs due to the long term data from use in psoriasis which points towards a very good safety profile. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review found moderate quality evidence of a reduction in the number of people with RRMS that had relapses over a two year treatment period with dimethyl fumarate versus placebo, as well as low quality evidence of a reduction in worsening disability, and an overall need for higher quality studies with longer follow- up. The relative effectiveness of different treatments is unclear, as most have only been compared to placebo or a small number of other therapies. Direct comparisons of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate similar effects or only small differences in effects on relapse rate, disease progression and magnetic resonance imaging measures. Alemtuzumab, natalizumab, and fingolimod may be more effective than other drugs in reducing relapses over the short term in people with RRMS. Natalizumab and interferon beta-1a (Rebif) may reduce relapses compared to both placebo and interferon beta-1a (Avonex) while Interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), glatiramer acetate, and mitoxantrone may also prevent relapses. Evidence on relative effectiveness in reducing disability progression is unclear. All medications are associated with adverse effects that may influence their risk to benefit profiles. While more studies of the long-term effects of the drugs are needed, specially for the newest treatments, existing data on the effects of interferons and glatiramer acetate indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes. Oral contraceptive pills have contradictory results from different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate in women with multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as carbamazepine (used to treat spasms and pain) and modafinil (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective. = Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS = Chemical structure of mitoxantrone Mitoxantrone has shown positive effects in people with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in people after two years. In 2007, it was the only medication approved in the US for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent cardiac toxicity which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe. Natalizumab has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. Studies on the use of Interferon-beta-1b in secondary progressive and progressive relapsing MS do not support that it slows progression of the disease, although it is effective in reducing the number of relapses. = Primary progressive MS = Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. As of 2013, Network meta-analysis of 9 immunomodulator and immunosuppressant agents suggested that there was no evidence of any being effective in preventing disability progression in people with progressive MS. Drugs tested include interferon beta, mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In March 2017, ocrelizumab was approved in the United States for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis in adults. It is also used for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults.  Managing the effects of MS  = Rehabilitation =  Physical therapy  Symptoms of MS that can be improved include fatigue, spasticity, depression, bladder dysfunction, and neurological symptoms. These symptoms can be improved by physical therapy and medication. Physical therapists can show strengthening exercises and ways to stretch; ultimately making daily tasks easier and reduces fatigue while muscle strength increases as flexibility increases. Exercise therapy can be proscribed safely without increased relapse risk, and is the best supported rehabilitation intervention for reducing fatigue and improving muscle strength, mobility and quality of life according to a overview of Cochrane systematic reviews for rehabilitation. Both drug therapy and neurorehabilitation have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.  Neurorehabilitation  Supervised physical therapy may be helpful to overcome some symptoms. Although there are relatively few studies of rehabilitation in MS, its general effectiveness, when conducted by a team of specialists, has been clearly demonstrated in other diseases such as stroke or head trauma. As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however there are particular difficulties in specifying a 'core team' because people with MS may need help from almost any health profession or service at some point. Neurologists are mainly involved in the diagnosis and ongoing management of multiple sclerosis, and any exacerbations. The comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by physiatrists. Allied treatments such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression should involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits. Multidisciplinary approaches have been shown to be effective in increasing activity levels and participation in multiple sclerosis. Studies investigating information provision in support of patient understanding and participation suggest that while interventions (written information, decision aids, coaching, educational programmes) may increase patient knowledge, the evidence of an effect on decision making and quality of life is mixed and low certainty. Due to the paucity of randomized controlled studies, there is limited evidence of the overall efficacy of individual therapy disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, psychology therapies, particularly cognitive behavioral approaches and energy conservation instruction are effective. More specifically psychological interventions seem useful in the treatment of depression, while evidence on effectiveness for other uses such as the treatment of cognitive impairments or vocational counseling is less strong. Cognitive training, alone or combined with other neuropsychological interventions, may show positive effects for memory and attention though firm conclusions are not possible given small sample numbers, variable methodology, interventions and outcome measures. The effectiveness of palliative approaches in addition to standard care is uncertain, due to lack of evidence. It is difficult to be specific about what types of rehabilitation will be most beneficial because therapies are tailored to meet the individual's specific needs. In regards to well-being, physical therapy focused on gait training can be vital to maximizing MS patient participation via reduction of fatigue during walking and activities of daily living (ADLs). Most gait training is performed over-ground (i.e., in a gym room or outside on uneven ground), on treadmills or, less commonly, using robotic-assisted devices. Robotic-assisted body weight-supported treadmill training may be an effective therapeutic option in MS patients with severe walking impairments. In contrast, over- ground gait training may be most effective in improving gait speed in MS patients with less severe impairments. Equine-assisted therapies such as therapeutic horseback riding and hippotherapy are additional treatments that can positively influence gait, balance and quality of life in people with MS. Historically, individuals with MS were advised against participation in physical activity due to worsening symptoms. However, under the direction of an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. The effectiveness of interventions, including exercise, specifically for the prevention of falls in people with MS is uncertain, while there is some evidence of an effect on balance function and mobility. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions. An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS during the course of exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. = Medical treatments for symptoms = Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. * Bladder: Symptomatology of the urinary tract is common in MS. Treatments for bladder problems vary depending on the origin or type of dysfunction but can mainly divided into treatment of bladder control and incontinence, and of urinary tract infections. Regarding bladder control, some examples of medications used are desmopressin for nocturia and anticholinergic drugs such as oxybutynin and tolterodine for urinary urgency. Non- pharmacological management includes pelvic floor muscle training, stimulation, pessaries, bladder retraining, changes to daily life habits such as clothing, use of external urine collection devices for men and incontinence pads for women; and sometimes intermittent urinary catheterization. Regarding long term catheterization, it is associated to urinary tract infections and should be avoided whenever possible. Some of these recommendations do not come from specific studies in MS but are general recommendations for those who have neurogenic bladder. * Bowel: bowel problems affect around 70% of the patients, with around 50% of the patients suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used in the treatment of the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral laxatives or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems. * Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric symptomatology is common in the course of the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil ‚Äîcommonly used in Alzheimer disease‚Äî are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice. * Dysphagia and dysarthria: dysphagia is a difficulty with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor control over the subsystems and muscles responsible for speech (\\"articulation\\"). A speech and language therapist may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. * Erectile dysfunction: erectile dysfunction is common in male patients with MS. There is some evidence indicating that sildenafil citrate may be a useful treatment. Prostaglandin E1 has shown benefits for patients with erectile dysfunction due to a range of causes including multiple sclerosis. * Fatigue: fatigue is very common and disabling in MS, and at the same time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS- related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended. * Pain: acute pain is mainly due to optic neuritis (with corticosteroids being the best treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with carbamazepine, clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated for the management of other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy. The evidence for the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for chronic pain is limited, very low quality and insufficient to recommend such interventions alone, however their use in combination with pharmacological agents may be reasonable. * Spasticity: spasticity is characterized by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings. Among non- pharmacological interventions there is low level and limited evidence of a benefit for spasticity for people with multiple sclerosis for physical activity programs, transcranial magneitc stimulation and pulsed electropmagnetic therapy. Systematic review has found no evidence of benefit exists for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, sports climbing and vibration therapy. * Vision: different drugs as well as optic compensatory systems and prisms can be used to improve the symptoms of nystagmus or diplopia (double vision). Surgery can also be used in some cases. * Walking : dalfampridine (ampyra) is a broad-spectrum potassium channel blocker. It is approved by the FDA to treat walking difficulties in MS. It has been shown to increase walking speed, although its high cost (over 1000 dollars a month) limits its usage. Other symptoms, such as ataxia, tremor or sensory losses, do not have proven treatments. Evidence for an effect of respiratory muscle training is heterogeneous and low quality, while the effect on important outcomes like cough efficacy, pneumonia, and quality of life have not been evaluated. Epileptic seizures are a potentially serious comorbidity in people in multiple sclerosis which is uncommon but nonetheless present more often than in the general population, however there is currently a lack of evidence on the efficacy and safety of anti-epileptic medication specifically in people with multiple sclerosis. possibly as a secondary result of demyelinating lesions, is a uncommon but potentially serious complaint  Research  Chemical structure of alemtuzumab Research directions on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; and the search for effective symptomatic treatments. Advances during the last decades has led to the recent approval of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-Œ≤-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients. Preliminary data have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil, an anti-rejection immunosuppressant medication, might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However a systematic review found that the limited evidence available was insufficient to determine the effects of mycophenolate mofetil as an add‚Äêon therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. Monoclonal antibodies, which are drugs of the same family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of interest and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied by the appearance of potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them. Another research strategy is to evaluate the combined effectiveness of two or more drugs. The main rationale for polytherapy in MS is that the involved treatments target different mechanisms of the disease and therefore their use is not necessarily exclusive. Moreover, synergies, in which a drug potentiates the effect of another are also possible. Nevertheless, there can also appear important drawbacks such as antagonizing mechanisms of action or potentiation of deleterious secondary effects. While there have been several clinical trials of combined therapy none has shown positive enough effects to merit the consideration as a viable treatment for MS. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs as well as those under development are probably going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients. Medications that influence voltage-gated sodium ion channels are under investigation as a potential neuroprotective strategy because of hypothesized role of sodium in the pathological process leading to axonal injury and accumulating disability. Currently, there is insufficient evidence of an effect of sodium channel blockers for people with MS. There is growing developments in the area of medical imaging and MRI, allowing for better reviews and understandings of MS in patients and how to treat each case in a more effective method. =Stem cell transplant= Finally, regarding neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as stem cell therapy, while their research is considered of high importance at the moment they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. A 2018 study found promising results in relapsing-remitting MS but more research is needed. =CCSVI= In 2008, vascular surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves a vascular process he referred to as chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted. He found CCSVI in all 65 patients with MS in his study. This theory received important attention in the media and among people with MS, specially in Canada. Concern has been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data. Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one. This has raised objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The \\"liberation procedure\\" has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven. Currently it is recommended not to use the proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies. Research on CCSVI has been fast tracked but researchers have been unable to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS.  Alternative treatments  Over 50% of MS patients may use complementary and alternative medicine, although numbers vary greatly depending on the definition of alternative medicine used. In the United States, it is estimated that 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control.Overview of CAM for management of MS Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Management Overview (Healthline) (28 July 2014). Retrieved on 30 October 2014 The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between vitamin D deficiency and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti- inflammatory effects of vitamin D. However available evidence suggests vitamin D supplementation, irrespective of the form and dose used, provides no apparent benefit for people with MS for measures such as relapse recurrence of , disability worsening and MRI lesions while effects on health‚Äêrelated quality of life and fatigue are unclear. For antioxidant therapy, studies have shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants can help induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered. Other alternative treatments include relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including the use of medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygenation, self-infection with hookworm (known generally as helminthic therapy) and bee venom therapy, reflexology or acupuncture. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time and tend to be more disabled.

It is published by Future and is devoted to the sport and pastime of cycling. It used to be affectionately referred to by British club cyclists as \\"The Comic\\".Matt Seaton: The Meeting of Minds, Guardian, 23 November 2006. History Cycling Weekly was first published by Edmund Dangerfield as Cycling on 24 January 1891. It briefly became Cycling and Moting in the 19th century when car-driving ‚Äì \\"moting\\" ‚Äì looked like it would replace cycling. Falling sales during the editorship of H.H. (Harry) England, who took what was considered to be a traditional view of cycling and opposed the reintroduction of massed racing on the roads as proposed by the British League of Racing Cyclists, led to the appearance in the 1950s of a rival weekly called The Bicycle and of a monthly entitled first Coureur and then Sporting Cyclist. Both eventually merged with Cycling. The title has changed hands on several occasions. It was first published by the Dangerfield Printing Company (1891‚Äì1894), then Temple Press (1895‚Äì1964), Go Magazine (1964‚Äì1967) and Longacre Press (1967‚Äì1970) before being published by its current owners, IPC Magazines (now IPC Media) from 1970. The magazine's longest-lasting contribution to the sport was the creation on 4 April 1930 of the British Best All-Rounder (BBAR) competition for individual time triallists, establishing the rider the magazine considered the best against the clock by averaging competitors' speeds over 50 and 100 miles and 12 hours. It offered a trophy to the winner each year and a shield for the winning team.Alpaca to Skinsuit, Bernard Thompson, Geerings of Ashford In 1932 Cycling also introduced the Golden Book of Cycling. Each page honoured a cycling hero. The first was Frank Southall, who had won that year's BBAR competition and signed his page before 7,000 cyclists attending the BBAR prize-giving at the Royal Albert Hall, London. The book has fallen out of fashion in recent years. Early campaigns The magazine was aware from the start of the danger it perceived cyclists to be in from the growing number of carsCycling, 4 July 1912, p7 and trams.Cycling, 4 July 1912, p20 The magazine did not care for insistence that cyclists display a back light, which it felt moved responsibility for avoiding an accident from the overtaking driver to the cyclist being overtaken. But it had other puzzles to consider, following the prosecution of a cyclist who had hung a Chinese lantern from his machine.Cycling, 11 July 1912, p27 Cycling campaigned against women's racing and refused to publish results and then, in the 1940s, stood out against the British League of Racing Cyclists in its campaign to reintroduce massed racing to open roads. It called the organisation's first race \\"A hopeless revolt.\\"Breckon, Mike (ed) (1993), A Wheel in Two Worlds, privately published, UK, p276 The modern magazine Looking for more sales and advertisers in June 1957, Cycling introduced pages dedicated to mopeds and the magazine changed its name to Cycling & Mopeds.Cycling, UK, 6 June 1957, p435 The move accelerated the decline in sales until, under the insistence of a new editor, Alan Gayfer, mopeds were abandoned and the magazine widened its outlook to all forms of racing on the road, on the track, to cyclo-cross and to cycle- touring. Among those taken on by Gayfer and who have remained in cycling journalism are the television commentator Phil Liggett and the author Les Woodland. Alan Gayfer left Cycling in 1969 to work for the United Press news agency on the other side of Fleet Street, London, where Cycling then had its offices. There he could also report his other love: boxing. He died of a heart attack while cycling in Canada after retirement. Gayfer was succeeded by Ken Evans, whose interest in short-distance time-trialling led to a parallel competition to the British Best All-Rounder: the Campagnolo Trophy for races over 25 miles (40 km). It lasted only two seasons before it was considered not worth the effort and expense. Evans resigned to work with the components wholesaler, Ron Kitching.cited Breckon, Michael (1993), A Wheel in two Worlds, the Ron Kitching Story, p227 Evans was replaced by Martin Ayres. He in turn was followed by Andrew Sutcliffe, who had been editor of Cycle Trader. Under Sutcliffe the magazine took on a stronger pictorial content and reporting of domestic cycling, especially where it didn't concern racing, was lessened in favour of coverage of continental racing. Sutcliffe left to help form a company called Cabal Communications, run by other former IPC staff. Cabal introduced a monthly magazine called Procycling as a rival to IPC's own monthly publication, Cycle Sport. Its first editor was William Fotheringham, who had also been on IPC's staff. Sutcliffe's replacement was Robert Garbutt, who is the current editor. Significant members of staff have included Sid Saltmarsh ‚Äì deputy editor under Alan Gayfer ‚Äì who worked formerly for the News Chronicle and the BBC and who was reporting the Tour de France when the English rider Tom Simpson died during the race in 1967. Recent columnists have included Tony Bell, and Michael Hutchinson. The magazine has hosted the work of what are believed to be two of the longest-serving contributors in publishing history. Frank Patterson was an illustrator whose impeccable drawings first appeared in a November issue in 1893. His last illustration appeared in 1952. Patterson was known for his meticulous treatment of the bicycle, especially the elusive ellipses, and his ability to capture different species of trees. It was said a Patterson Oak could never be mistaken for an Elm. His pen of choice was a Gillott 303. Patterson's length of service was eventually beaten by cartoonist Johnny Helms who had a simple, but unmistakable style. His cartoons were a regular fixture of the magazine from 6 February 1946 until his death in November 2009 and perfectly captured the idiosyncrasies of British club life, especially time trialling, a cyclists domestic life and his infamous cyclist-hating dog. Controversy In September 2017, Cycling Weekly were forced to apologize for a caption on an image in an edition of the magazine that read \\"token attractive woman\\" above an image of Hannah Noel, who is a female member of the Hinckley Cycling Race Club which is located in Leicester, England. The caption was noticed by fellow Hinckley Cycling member Carlos Fandango who tweeted it in a photo along with a request for an apology. \\"So my cycling club made it into @cyclingweekly and this happened. I hope @cyclingweekly apologise. Still a lot of equality work to do it.\\" Hannah took to Facebook and posted; \\"I made it into Cycling Weekly, it seems not for my ability as a female cyclist but as a 'token attractive woman' ‚Äì I'm absolutely gutted and disappointed in the magazine,\\" Noel wrote on Facebook (via the Telegraph).\\"It's not really the reason I'd want to be in a magazine, it's sexist and derogatory to female cyclists.\\" Cycling Weekly editor Simon Richardson stated that the caption was an error and blamed a sub- editor for its inclusion. The apology read: \\"Unfortunately during the magazine's production process a member of the sub-editing team decided to write an idiotic caption on a photo of one of the female members of the club\\". \\"The caption is neither funny nor representative of the way we feel or approach our work\\". \\"We would like to apologies unreservedly to the rider in the photograph. This appalling lack of judgement by an individual is just that, and not a reflection of the culture in the CW office.\\" Fandango's tweet and Cycling Weekly's apology prompted hundreds of angry responses, many that blamed a culture of sexism within the sport.

Born in New York City in 1961 to academic parents, he came into prominence in the early 1980s playing with rock/reggae/Latin band from Miami named \\"Watchdog\\". He is the co-owner of Main Drag Music located in Williamsburg. There, he creates custom snares, and repairs and sells drums. He has been listed on a number of lists of great drummers. History The band had a large following in south Florida fronted by Alonso Brito, then known as Dennis Britt and opened and headlined large venues as well as weekly engagements at various local clubs. Watchdog was recorded and mixed by Ron and Howard Albert, known collectively as the Albert Brothers at Criteria Studios in Miami. He was one of the first drummers in that area who used electronic drums along with samples and a drum machine, specifically the Linn 9000, E-mu SP-1200, Emulator II, and Simmons Drums SDS-7 and Simmons SDS-V . Due to the incredible demand of electronic drums at this point, he managed to find a great deal of session and tour work with bands and individuals including The Isolator, Miami Sound Machine, Perfect Strangers, Jimi Fiano, Gordon Hart, Henk Milne, Paris Maria, Ann Monaco, Randy Rush, as well as many calls for television and radio work. China Shop, Gentleman Farmers, and the 80's After two years in Florida, he moved back to his native New York City and found himself working with Naux, from Richard Hell and the Voidoids in a band called China Shop, recording two records. Prior to China Shop was a band with Naux, Jennifer Smith, and Larry Heinemann called Gentleman Farmers, who never released anything yet recorded with Mike McMackin. As well as a steady schedule of live and studio work, Fell recorded, toured, played with many bands and individuals, including Mercurial Line, Joan Jett, Rope, The Loveless, Jorma Kaukonen, Bankie Banx, Polio Ponies, Joe Walsh, and many others. Kelly Township In 1994 he joined a band called Kelly Township that was immediately signed to London Records after then Vice President Russ Rieger demanded their signing, and did a record produced by Ted Nicely who had recorded Fugazi, Shudder to Think, Girls Against Boys, and Jawbox. When things went badly at London due to internal problems they moved to Reprise Records under Sue Drew and were dropped. Kelly Township explored a mix of drugs and sexuality in their lyrics and were part of a huge frenzy when they first began playing in 1994. Originally the vocals were handled by Ali Smith, later of Speedball Baby, and then were taken over by Ike Machamer, the band's main writer and founder. There were high expectations for Kelly Township, but the band broke up. Heroine Sheiks Shortly after Fell joined ex Cows singer Shannon Selberg and ex Swans guitarist Norman Westberg, forming a true downtown supergroup called The Heroine Sheiks. Joined by Ultra Bide bassist George Porfiris, The Heroine Sheiks released an initial 12\\" single \\"(We Are The) Heroine Sheiks\\" on Amphetamine Reptile, then Rape on the Installment Plan on Reptilian Records (this title a reference to Celine's novel Death on the Installment Plan) followed by Siamese Pipe on Rubric Records. Critically acclaimed, the records sold well, but Fell left the band after rupturing his eardrums on tour. This coincided with Westberg leaving, and Fell was unable to play for many months. The Heroine Sheiks then reformed with the remaining remnants of Brooklyn band The Sons of Mata Hari (bassist Rob Kimball, drummer Eric Robe and guitarist Martin Ros) and went on to release two more albums, Out of Aferica and (returning to Celine's Journey to the End of the Night), Journey to the End of the Knife. Current bands Recently Fell has been performing with Kid Congo Powers of the Cramps, Gun Club, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds along with another downtown legend Jack Martin, who was also in Cause For Applause along with David Lloyd of The Boggs along with Jonathan Toubin formerly of Grand Mal. Fell was not the original drummer for this band and recorded tracks for Say Hey Records but they were never released. Cause For Applause was welcomed by New York and sold well but various problems hampered the groups' success. Equipment used Always trying new sounds has been a big part of Fell's success. As one of the first to use Simmons Electronic drums along with drum machines live, he often had to resort to complicated fabrication in order to mix the sounds. When MIDI came out he applied it and used it to simplify his set though at this point he was starting to get back into acoustic drums and began a long relationship with Sonor drums. Fell used Sonors in many different contexts, but using them with The Heroine Sheiks was very unusual in the world of Indie Rock which usually finds people using lo-fi gear. He then brought back a Ludwig stainless steel kit identical to the one John Bonham used in the later days of Led Zeppelin that he had owned for many years. It was huge and powerful and complimented The Heroine Sheiks heavy sound perfectly.

(The latter is sometimes termed \\"ocular visual impairment\\" when discussed in contrast to cortical visual impairment.) Some people have both CVI and a form of ocular visual impairment. CVI is also sometimes known as cortical blindness, although most people with CVI are not totally blind. The term neurological visual impairment (NVI) covers both CVI and total cortical blindness. Delayed visual maturation, another form of NVI, is similar to CVI, except the child's visual difficulties resolve in a few months. Though the vision of a person with CVI may change, it rarely if ever becomes totally normal. The major causes of CVI are as follows: asphyxia, hypoxia (a lack of sufficient oxygen in the body‚Äôs blood cells), or ischemia (not enough blood supply to the brain), all of which may occur during the birth process; developmental brain defects; head injury; hydrocephalus (when the cerebrospinal fluid does not circulate properly around the brain, and collects in the head, putting pressure on the brain); a stroke involving the occipital lobe; and infections of the central nervous system, such as meningitis and encephalitis. Symptoms Symptoms of CVI usually include several (but not necessarily all) of the following: * The person with CVI exhibits variable vision. Visual ability can change from one day to the next but it can also fluctuate from minute to minute, especially when the person is tired. When undertaking critical activities, people with CVI should be prepared for their vision to fluctuate, by taking precautions such as always carrying a white cane even if they don't always use it to the full, or always having very large print available, just in case it's needed. (For example, consider the consequences of losing vision while giving a public speech). Managing fatigue can reduce fluctuations but does not eliminate them. Changes in environment, even minor, are mostly responsible for what appears to be variable vision. * One eye may perform significantly worse than the other, and depth perception can be very limited (although not necessarily zero). * The field of view may be severely limited. The best vision might be in the centre (like tunnel vision) but more often it is at some other point, and it is difficult to tell what the person is really looking at. Note that if the person also has a common ocular visual impairment such as nystagmus then this can also affect which part(s) of the visual field are best. (Sometimes there exists a certain gaze direction which minimises the nystagmus, called a \\"null point.\\") * Even though the field of view may be very narrow indeed, it is often possible for the person to detect and track movement. Movement is handled by the 'V5' part of the visual cortex, which may have escaped the damage. Sometimes a moving object can be seen better than a stationary one; at other times the person can sense movement but cannot identify what is moving. (This can be annoying if the movement is prolonged, and to escape the annoyance the person may have to either gaze right at the movement or else obscure it.) Sometimes it is possible for a person with CVI to see things while moving their gaze around that they didn't detect when stationary. However, movement that is too fast can be hard to track; some people find that fast-moving objects \\"disappear.\\" Materials with reflective properties, which can simulate movement, may be easier for a person with CVI to see. However, too many reflections can be confusing (see cognitive overload). * Some objects may be easier to see than others. For example, the person may have difficulty recognising faces or facial expressions but have fewer problems with written materials. This is presumably due to the different way that the brain processes different things. * Colour and contrast are important. The brain's colour processing is distributed in such a way that it is more difficult to damage, so people with CVI usually retain full perception of colour. This can be used to advantage by colour-coding objects that might be hard to identify otherwise. Sometimes yellow and red objects are easier to see, as long as this does not result in poor contrast between the object and the background. * People with CVI strongly prefer a simplified view. When dealing with text, for example, the person might prefer to see only a small amount of it at once. People with CVI frequently hold text close to their eyes, both to make the text appear larger and to minimise the amount they must look at. This also ensures that important things such as letters are not completely hidden behind any scotomas (small defects in parts of the functioning visual field), and reduces the chances of getting lost in the text. However, the simplification of the view should not be done in such a way that it requires too rapid a movement to navigate around a large document, since too much motion can cause other problems (see above). *In viewing an array of objects, people with CVI can more easily see them if they only have to look at one or two at a time. People with CVI also see familiar objects more easily than new ones. Placing objects against a plain background also makes them easier for the person with CVI to see. * For the same reason (simplified view), the person may also dislike crowded rooms and other situations where their functioning is dependent on making sense of a lot of visual 'clutter'. * Visual processing can take a lot of effort. Often the person has to make a conscious choice about how to divide mental effort between making sense of visual data and performing other tasks. For some people, maintaining eye contact is difficult, which can create problems in Western culture (for example, bonding can be difficult for some parents who have an infant with CVI, and lack of contact in an older child can cause others to regard him or her with suspicion). *It can also be difficult for some people with CVI to look at an object and reach for it at the same time. Looking and reaching are sometimes accomplished as two separate acts: look, then look away and reach. * People with CVI can sometimes benefit from a form of blindsight, which manifests itself as a kind of awareness of one's surroundings that cannot consciously be explained (for example, the person correctly guesses what they should do in order to avoid an obstacle but does not actually see that obstacle). However, this cannot be relied on to work all the time. In contrast, some people with CVI exhibit spatial difficulties and may have trouble moving about in their environment. * Approximately one third of people with CVI have some photophobia. It can take longer than usual to adjust to large changes in light level, and flash photography can be painful. On the other hand, CVI can also in some cases cause a desire to gaze compulsively at light sources, including such things as candle flames and fluorescent overhead lights. The use of good task lighting (especially low-temperature lamps which can be placed at very close range) is often beneficial. * Although people (with or without CVI) generally assume that they see things as they really are, in reality the brain may be doing a certain amount of guessing and \\"filling in\\", which is why people sometimes think they see things that turn out on closer inspection not to be what they seemed. This can occur more frequently when a person has CVI. Hence, a person with CVI can look at an optical illusion or abstract picture and perceive something that is significantly different from what a person without CVI will perceive. The presence of CVI does not necessarily mean that the person's brain is damaged in any other way, but it can often be accompanied by other neurological problems, the most common being epilepsy.  Diagnosis  Diagnosing CVI is difficult. A diagnosis is usually made when visual performance is poor but it is not possible to explain this from an eye examination. Before CVI was widely known among professionals, some would conclude that the patient was faking their problems or had for some reason engaged in self-deception. However, there are now testing techniques that do not depend on the patient's words and actions, such as fMRI scanning, or the use of electrodes to detect responses to stimuli in both the retina and the brain. These can be used to verify that the problem is indeed due to a malfunction of the visual cortex and/or the posterior visual pathway.

Jimenez, who was of Mexican American descent, was born in Kerrville, Texas. He was a 1952 graduate of Trinity University with majors in biology and physical education. Jimenez played on the PGA Tour in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He spent many years (1964‚Äì1991) as the club pro at the Jefferson City Country Club in Jefferson City, Missouri. His best showing in a major championship was a T-45 at the 1958 U.S. Open. The highlight of his career came when he won the 1978 PGA Seniors' Championship in a playoff over Manuel de la Torre and Joe Cheves with a birdie on the first extra hole of a sudden-death playoff. Jimenez holds or formerly held two of golf's \\"shoot below your age\\" records. At the 1991 GTE Northwest Classic, a Senior PGA Tour event, 65-year-old Jimenez became the youngest player to shoot his age or lower in a tournament on one of golf's major professional circuits by shooting a 63. This record was later broken when 61-year-old Walter Morgan shot a 60 in the AT&T; Canada Senior Open Championship. Jimenez still holds the most-strokes-below-age (7) record. He shot a 62 during the 1995 Ameritech Senior Open at the age of 69. Since 1974, the Jefferson City Country Club has hosted a tournament in his honor, the Joe Jimenez Invitational He holds several Georgia-Pacific Grand Champions records.

It is a three- story stone structure with a full cellar, three bays wide, with a side gable roof. A single-story ell extends to the left. The main entrance is in the left-most bay, sheltered by a gabled hood. There is a secondary entrance on the right end wall. The gable ends have pent roofs below, and circular windows in the gable center. The interior is decorated with period 18th-century furnishings and artifacts related to George Washington. The house was built 1768-70 by Isaac Potts, a Quaker who operated a grist mill nearby. George Washington, and later his wife Martha as well, occupied this house from Christmas Eve 1777 until June 18, 1778. Washington conducted the army's business in an office on the ground floor during that period.

Biography  Lucius Cornelius Merula held the office of Flamen Dialis (high priest of Jupiter), and wore the flamens cap at all times, unlike the other flamines who only wore it while performing sacrifices. In 87 BC, during the civil war between Marius and Sulla, he was appointed consul by the Senate in place of Marius's ally Cinna, who had been driven from the city. He negotiated the return of Cinna and Marius from banishment, and abdicated his consulship. However, false charges were made against him during Marius's purges of his political enemies, and he committed suicide, opening his veins in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and imploring the gods to avenge him on Cinna and his allies. He had first taken care to remove his flamen's cap, for it was considered a sin for a flamen to wear it at his death. The position of Flamen Dialis was now vacant. Marius's fourteen-year-old nephew Julius Caesar was nominated to fill it in 86 BC by Marius and Cinna.Suet. Div.

Scholars disagree but this nomination was annulled by Sulla subsequently.Suet. Div. Iul.1.2 makes clear that Sulla deprived Julius of the priesthood, so he must have held it.

A 630 metre long taxiway connects the runway to a small Helipad cum apron. The runway is too small for commercial aircraft like Boeing 737 and Airbus A 320, which need a 2,190 metres in length and 45 metres in width (6,860 ft.) takeoff distance.

Student competitions help bring about a student‚Äôs best effort by inspiring creativity and challenging the student to utilize their skills. Teachers incorporate student competitions as part of their curriculum to encourage students to stay on task and bring forward their best work by significantly increasing the ‚ÄòPayoff for the Student‚Äô by providing: *In-class marks towards final grades. *The opportunity to put their creativity and skill set to the test by allowing them to show off their comprehensive knowledge of, for example, a software, hardware, or music technology item. *An occasion to compare their skill levels and creativity with that of students across the world, as well as with their own local classmates. *A chance at winning cash and other great prizes.  Types of student competitions  Different types of student competitions exist: # Case study ‚Äì This competition revolves around solving a real or imaginary case given to the competitors. The goal is to find a solution using the information provided in the case. # Business Plan ‚Äì A competition for which a business plan needs to be written for either an existing or fictional business. Most entrepreneurship competitions will be of this form. # Design Competition ‚Äì A Student Design Competition can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical competitions is to introduce students to real-world engineering situations and to teach students project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually require art and design skills. # Simulation ‚Äì Students compete either online or via software simulating an environment in which decisions need to be made. These decisions and the outcomes are monitored to decide on the winner. Sometimes the whole event is online and no physical location is given. # Ideation - A competition where ideas for different concepts are the main deliverables. The ideas may or may not be executed at a later time. Many competitions in which a semi-structured body of text needs to be delivered are considered in this category. # Essay ‚Äì Writing an essay (a short piece of writing) about a topic. Topics can vary and can be mandated or left to the writers‚Äô discretion. The main deliverable is a body of text that is written in a specific form. There are many student competitions running across the globe. Often, these competitions consist of students first competing with other students in their classrooms.

It contains only the type species, V. praetermissus. Harrison (1979) erected this genus because he found himself unable to assign a 19th-century plaster cast of a broken tarsometatarsus bone originally retrieved from Siwalik Hills sediments to modern cormorants. As the fossil itself is apparently lost, this makes the genus a nomen dubium. Few other researchers have commented on this, most deciding not to discuss this taxon. Those that did chided Harrison's decision to assign an undiagnostic and possibly damaged cast as a type specimen of a new genus. Olson (1985) called it > \\"...very near the acme of zealotry for naming new species of fossil birds. > It is highly doubtful that the genus Valenticarbo could be shown to be > valid, even if a specimen of it did exist.\\" Carroll (1988) considers this \\"genus\\" a synonym of Phalacrocorax, the modern cormorants. Given that fossil cormorants not assignable to Phalacrocorax are not known to have occurred later than Early Pliocene, this is likely to be correct, but the possibility that the original fossil was not of a cormorant at all cannot be discounted.

Cayton-Holland is also a writer and has been published in both regional and national publications in addition to headlining clubs and colleges throughout the United States as a comic. Career =Stand-up comedy= Adam Cayton-Holland started in stand-up comedy by attending open mics at Denver dive bars in 2003. In 2006, Cayton-Holland competed against nearly 200 other aspiring comedians for Comedy Works' New Talent showcase, and won. Cayton-Holland was included in Esquires 25 Best New Stand-Up Comedians in 2012. That same year he was invited to the prestigious New Faces competition at Montreal's Just for Laughs Comedy Festival, appeared on the Nerdist podcast, and had a cameo on the ABC show Happy Endings (TV series). After making his national television stand-up debut on Conan in 2013, he appeared on The Pete Holmes Show in February 2014. He quickly followed that appearance with a repeat trip to South by Southwest where he was featured on the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast and competed on @midnight against Baron Vaughn and Rove McManus. Cayton-Holland was invited back on @midnight for the September 17, 2014 episode when he competed against Beth Stelling and Nate Bargatze, winning the competition; and returned to the show again for the April 14, 2015 episode, facing Megan Neuringer and Kurt Braunohler. =The Grawlix= In 2007, Cayton-Holland founded Wrist Deep Productions with fellow comedians Greg Baumhauer, Ben Roy, Jim Hickox, and Andrew Orvedahl. Wrist Deep developed \\"Los Comicos Super Hilariosos,\\" a regular show that welcomed big-name comics like Arj Barker, Maria Bamford, Tig Notaro, and Moshe Kasher. The group eventually dissolved and reformed as The Grawlix in 2011. The Grawlix consists of Cayton- Holland, Ben Roy and Andrew Orvedahl. The troupe performs a monthly show at The Bug Theater in Denver, featuring standup sets from each of the principals, a variety of national guest comedians, and screenings of their web series videos, produced by The Nix brothers. Those Who Can't The Grawlix also teamed with The Nix Brothers to produce a pilot for Amazon in June 2012 called Those Who Can't, about three inept Denver high school teachers. While Amazon eventually passed on the pilot, TruTV paid the trio to rewrite and re-film it in December 2014. In February 2015, the network announced they were ordering 10 episodes of the series. The show ultimately aired on TruTV for 3 seasons. The Grawlix Saves the World In January 2020 The Grawlix started a podcast, The Grawlix Saves the World. As of September 29, 2020 twenty-two episodes have been released. =Writer= Before becoming a comedian, Cayton- Holland was a journalist, working at Denver's alt-weekly Westword from 2003 through 2008. Best known for his \\"What's So Funny?\\" column, while at Westword he also did regular long-form feature writing. His writing has appeared in Spin and The Onion's A.V. Club. In late 2013, Cayton-Holland had a piece called \\"Ghosts I've Known\\" published in The Atlantic. The essay addressed the painful topic of his younger sister's suicide. Reviewer Michael Wear called it a \\"haunting,\\" \\"beautiful,\\" and \\"heartfelt\\" \\"love letter.\\" The essay eventually turned into a comic-tragic memoir titled \\"Tragedy + Time\\", published in August 2018 by Simon & Schuster. Asked to describe the book in 50 words or less, Cayton-Holland said: \\"If you‚Äôre expecting a guide to navigating life after grief, this isn‚Äôt it. It‚Äôs an honest look at mental illness, depression, death and the beautiful relationships between families and siblings ‚Äî one that lets you know that there is no guide to grief, and that it‚Äôs still O.K. to laugh.\\" =Other projects= High Plains Comedy Festival In 2013, Cayton-Holland partnered with Denver comedian/producer Andy Juett to launch the High Plains Comedy Festival. In its inaugural year, the Festival ran three days in venues throughout Denver, and featured both local and national talent‚Äîincluding headliner Reggie Watts, Matt Braunger, and Kyle Kinane. High Plains returned to Denver in 2014 with T.J. Miller, Kumail Nanjiani, and Pete Holmes headlining. Podcast Cayton-Holland produces a biweekly podcast called My Dining Room Table that he began in spring 2013. The central concept to the podcast is Cayton-Holland's loyalty to and love of Denver and his home (hence, the majority of the recordings happening at his literal dining room table), and his subsequent decision to stay in the city rather than move to LA or New York. He interviews local and national comics and musicians about a variety of topics, but often returns to the core ideas of \\"home\\" and \\"success\\" while promoting the burgeoning Denver cultural scene. Personal life Cayton-Holland grew up in the neighborhood of Park Hill, Denver. He attended East High School (Denver) and Wesleyan University where he majored in film. His \\"twin obsessions\\" are birdwatching and the Colorado Rockies baseball team. His father has held Rockies season tickets since the team was formed. Before the start of the 2014 season, Cayton-Holland campaigned to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Rockies' game. He created a buzz on Twitter with the hashtag #ACHFirstPitch, and took the plea national when he talked about it on The Pete Holmes Show. On April 7, 2014, Cayton-Holland got his wish when he threw out the first pitch at a Rockies vs. White Sox game at Coors Field. Cayton-Holland lives with his wife and son in Denver, Colorado.

As a former FIFA Players Agent, Roberts worked closely with several clubs as he was experienced with the Overseas Labour Service and acquired many work permits for non-EEA Players. In November 2006, Roberts introduced a new initiative whereby Torquay players would be disciplined and potentially dismissed if they dived and constantly brought the Club's reputation into disrepute, by repeatedly trying to fool referees by diving.Torquay to dismiss diving players BBC Sport This did not prove very popular in the UK as the Players Union felt sidelined, but the idea gained a lot of support from the US Major League Soccer. UEFA also supported the move in principle. This may have sowed the seeds for UEFA's recent decision to hold players to account for diving, post match to the annoyance of Ars√®ne Wenger, following Arsenal's game with Celtic in the Champions League in 2009. On 27 November 2006 Roberts appointed his friend from the Czech Republic, Lubos Kubik, as manager and Bateson's son-in-law, Richard Hancox as his assistant. Former manager Ian Atkins was offered the post of Director of Football, but decided against staying with the new regime. On 4 January 2007 the Torquay United Supporters Trust released a press statement proposing a vote of no confidence in Roberts as chairman of the football club, two days before their first planned meeting with the new board, which was cancelled. On 6 February 2007, Roberts probably made his best decision by appointing fan's favourite Colin Lee as the new director of football. Lee signed a three-year deal and said \\"Over the next 3 years I intend to implement a new blue print for the football department of Torquay United to put us on a par with comparable sized clubs higher up the Football League ladder.\\" Lee followed this by appointing former player Keith Curle as the new head coach. Along with the appointment of Colin Lee, Roberts did make some positive changes, including the creation of the 'Educational Soccer Development Programme' in conjunction with Paignton Community Sports College, which brought youth team football back to Plainmoor. He also appointed Sally Eagling as Marketing Manager. Sally continued until the end of the 2008-09 season,GULLS BID FAREWELL TO SALLY thisissouthdevon.co.uk, 14 May 2009 and helped the new local consortium which eventually bought the Club from Mike Bateson. The Club struggled at the bottom of the league, the gate receipts for 15 consecutive home games, were down by 1,000 supporters a match, this reduced income by approximately ¬£150,000 over a 3-month period, the Consortium were unable to raise the additional funds to maintain the Club, Roberts took the only decision possible and handed the Club back to Bateson and resigned as chairman on 14 February 2007. Ironically Roberts always maintained that Torquay United need to develop a new Stadium, otherwise they would struggle to compete financially, however he never had the opportunity to implement his long term plans.

Description Its size was 9.5 cm, the wing length 11.4 cm and length of the tail 2.7 cm. The black bill was slightly curved and conical pointed. The feet were black. The back exhibited a bronze green hue with a golden gleam. The head was similar coloured like the back with the absence of the golden gloss. Directly behind the eyes was a white spot. The throat gleamed in magnificent blue green colour hues. The abdomen had green feathers with ash-grey tips. The wings exhibited a purplish hue. The rectrices were greenish. The crissum (these are the undertail coverts which surrounded the cloacal opening) was grey with a faint cinnamon hue at the edges. Status and extinction For more than a hundred years Brace's emerald was only known by one single male specimen which was shot by bird collector Lewis J. K. Brace on July 13, 1877 around three miles (4.8 kilometres) away from Nassau in the inland of New Providence. The skin which is unfortunately heavily injured at the throat is now at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. This small hummingbird was long ignored by the ornithological authorities. In 1880 it was listed without commentary as a synonym of the Cuban emerald (Riccordia ricordii). Until the 1930s the unique status of the holotype was not even recognized or it was seen as an aberrant specimen of the Cuban emerald which was blown to New Providence. American ornithologist James Bond was the first to discuss the differences between R. ricordii and R. bracei. In 1945 he split R. ricordii and regarded R. ricordii bracei as a new subspecies. In contrast to the Cuban race the specimen from New Providence was smaller, had a longer bill and a different plumage. In 1982 palaeornithologists William Hilgartner and Storrs Olson discovered fossil remains of three hummingbird species from the Pleistocene in the deposits in a cave of New Providence. These were the Bahama woodstar (Nesophlox evelynae), Cuban emerald (Riccordia ricordii), and a species which was later identified as Riccordia bracei. This provided evidence that Brace had discovered a new hummingbird species which lived on New Providence since the Pleistocene. It formed a relict population and probably due to habitat loss and human disturbance (e.g. agriculture) it became extinct at the end of the 19th century.

He assumed the Hindu name Chakradhawaj Singha. At the installation ceremony, the Jaintia Raja sent an envoy to convey his congratulation. So also did the Koch Raja of Darrang, who had sided with Mir Jumla during his invasion, and with whom friendly relations were thus restored. About the same time Mughal emperor Aurangzeb had presented a khelat or robe of honour to Supangmung, and the imperial envoys insisted on the king's donning them in their presence. King Supangmung could not stand this grave humiliation. He shouted out from his throne--\\"Death is preferable to a life of subordination to foreigners. I have to surrender my independence for a suit of sewn garments!\\" =Recapture of Guwahati= Chakradhawaj Singha soon after the start of his reign started repairing the forts at Samdhara and Patakallangand and restored the army to a state of efficiency. In March 1665 the king summoned an assembly of his ministers and nobles and ordered them to devise and adopt measures for expelling Mughals from Western Assam, adding--\\"My ancestors were never subordinate to any other people; and I for myself cannot remain under the vassalage of any foreign power. I am a descendant of the Heavenly King and how can I pay tribute to the wretched foreigners.\\"In 1669 , at the behest of Guru Tegh Bahadur ninth guru of the sikhs a peaceful accord was reached at Dhubri between forces of Mughal led by Raja Ram Singh I of Amber and king Chakardhawaj Singha. Early in 1667 Saiad Firuz Khan, who succeeded Rashid Khan as Thanadar of Guwahati, sent a strongly worded letter to the Ahom King, demanding the payment of the balance of the indemnity still outstanding. On receiving this letter, Chakradhavaj Singha made up his mind to fight the Mughals. The necessary preparation were made with all speed, and in August 1667 a well-equipped army set out led by Lachit Borphukan to wrest Guwahati from the Mughals. King Supangmung gave valuable gifts to the commanders of the expedition and delivered to them the following message--\\"I desire that your wives and children, and the cows and Brahmans should be duly protected and preserved; and I should also acquire the prestige and reputation of having vanquished the Mughals. If you prove incompetent in the task of defeating the enemy at Itakhuli you shall not be let off with impunity. And, do you think that there will paucity of Phukans and Rajkhowas like yourselves.\\" At midnight, around November 2, 1667, Itakhuli and the contiguous garrison of Guwahati fell into the hands of Ahoms. The victors took possession of the elephants, horses, guns, coins and all other articles which they found in the imperial stores in Guwahati. The enemy was chased down to the mouth of Manas River, the old boundary of Assam and Mughal India. The Ahoms also succeeded in bringing back the Assamese subjects who had been taken captives by the Mughals during the expedition of Mir Jumla. Thus within the short span of two months the Ahoms succeeded in recovering their lost possession and along with it their lost prestige and glory, and this was due mainly to the determination and courage of Ahom King Supangmung. On receiving the news of victory the king cried out--\\"It is now that I can eat my morsel of food with ease and pleasure\\" =The Ideal Monarch= The king was regarded by Assamese as the fountain head of all energy and inspiration, and Lachit Barphukan was fortunate in having Supangmung as the supreme head of the state. The patriotism and self-respect of this monarch have but few parallels in the history of Assam. He had to suffer in the beginning from the shameful legacies of the preceding regime. During the two years long preparation for the war with the Mughals, the monarch personally supervised the preparations‚Äîstocking of food, arms and ammunitions, he placed the smiths inside the palace enclosures to oversee their work, trained the archers with his own hand, then finally ordered the march to Gauhati when he was fully satisfied with the preparation. Supangmung also sent letters to neighbouring chiefs in order to obtain their cooperation and support in his plan to resist the Mughals. The king's patriotic intent and self-respect came out in the letters of the period. In June 1664, he wrote to Raja Prana Narayan of Koch Behar, \\"You know for yourself all about the manner in which we repeatedly dealt heavy blows upon the Mughals. If God has inflicted on us a reverse on this occasion, does it imply that we shall be subjected to discomfiture a second time?\\" He wrote again in February 1666, \\"Because the Mughals have humiliated us once, does it follow that we should make no attempt to throw off this position of subordination to them? Supangmung's insight and wisdom were best shown in the selection of Lachit Barphukan as the commander in chief to lead the new army. A wrong man would have behaved differently, but the king's nominee was imbued with the same zeal and patriotism of the spirited sovereign, and he succeeded in expelling the Mughal from Assam. Supangmung also ordered his Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain, a skilled soldier, military engineer and diplomat to accompany Lachit Borphukan on the campaign to oust the Mughals from Assam. While the best brains of the country, whether in statesmanship or warcraft were in the frontline at Gauhati, the King had to manage the affairs of the country with inferior talents and abilities. Sitting at the capital for nearly two years he managed and gave logistic support to the army in the front supplying men, arms and food materials. After the recapture of Gauhati and recovery of the land up to the old boundary at Manas river, King Supangmung organised and streamlined the civil administration and revenue collection system of lower Assam under senior officers‚ÄîPhukans and Rajkhowas adapting from the Mughal's system. From the capital he maintained an efficient civil administration in the country which was necessary to guarantee the regular reinforcements of men and materials to the Army in the frontline. = Death of King Supangmung = The long war has taken both physical and mental toll of the King and in April 1670 Supangmung died, just one year before the Battle of Saraighat. The King did not get the satisfaction of seeing the final defeat of the imperialist Mughal Army at Saraighat, which sealed the fate of all the Mughal plans of expansion of their kingdom to the East. Supangmung gave the desired momentum which paved the way for the ultimate victory of the Assamese.

A vehicle with good ride quality provides a comfort for the driver and passengers. Importance Good ride quality provides comfort for the people inside the car, minimises damage to cargo and can reduce driver fatigue on long journeys in uncomfortable vehicles, and also because road disruption can impact the driver's ability to control the vehicle. Suspension design is often a compromise between ride quality and car handling, because cars with firm suspension can result in greater control of body movements and quicker reactions. Similarly, a lower center of gravity is more ideal for handling, but low ground clearance limits suspension travel, requiring stiffer springs. Ambulances have a special need for a high level of ride quality, in order to avoid further injury to the already ill passengers.https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042712-134653/unrestricted/FINAL_AUCAS_MQP_Report.pdf Technology Early vehicles, like the Ford Model T, with its leaf spring, live axle suspension design, were both uncomfortable and handled poorly. Historically, weight was key to allowing cars such as the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and the Cadillac in the 1950s and 1960s to have a more comfortable ride quality. However, there are various drawbacks to heavier cars, including poor fuel efficiency, acceleration, braking, cornering and additional stresses on components. Over time, technology has shifted this curve outward, so that it is possible to offer vehicles that are extremely comfortable and still handle very well, or vehicles with excellent handling that are also reasonably comfortable. One technical solution for offering both excellent comfort and reduced or eliminating body roll is by using computer-controlled suspensions, such as hydraulic active suspension system (like Active Body Control) or active anti-roll bars, however such systems are expensive because of their complexity.  Factors affecting ride quality  The main factors which affect ride quality are the stiffness of the suspension components (e.g. springs, shock absorbers, anti-roll bars and bushings). Other factors include suspension geometry, vehicle mass and weight distribution.

It functions to stimulate the secretion of growth hormone and as a ghrelin mimetic which causes the body to secrete human growth hormone in a way usually seen at puberty and in young adulthood. Initial studies have shown the drug to directly raise insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone levels. The drug is being considered for its therapeutic value in aging adults because elderly people have much lower levels of growth hormone and less lean muscle mass, which can result in weakness and frailty. In a one-year treatment trial (starting 1999) with 395 seniors between 65 and 84 years old, patients who received the drug gained an average of 3 lb (1.4 kg) in lean body mass in the first six months and also were better able to walk in a straight line in a test of balance, strength and coordination. After 12 months, patients receiving capromorelin also had an improved ability to climb stairs, however the results were not good enough to continue the trial for the 2nd planned year.

Their fossil bones have been recovered from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian, c. 70.6 ‚Äì 66 mya) Lecho Formation at estancia El Brete, Argentina. The genus contains a single species, Lectavis bretincola.  Description  Etymology: \\"Lecho Formation bird living at El Brete\\". Lectavis, after Latin lectus (\\"bed\\") = Spanish lecho + Latin avis, \\"bird\\". bretincola, after the type locality estancia El Brete + Latin incola, \\"inhabitant\\". The presently only known fossil bones (PVL-4021-1) are mostly of the left tibiotarsus (lower leg) and tarsometatarsus (upper foot) of a single individual. L. bretincola was a sizeable bird, with a tibiotarsus and a tarsometatarsus which if complete must have been nearly long (Chiappe 1993); this would make it roughly similar to a large curlew in size and at least in leg shape. It possesses a hypotarsus, which it evolved autapomorphically from modern birds, as it covers the upper end of the second, not the third, toe's bones. This structure serves to attach and arrest the posterior cruciate ligament, which in turn prevents the lower and upper leg from shifting out of position during walking. Thus, it can be concluded that L. bretincola was a much more terrestrial species than its relative Yungavolucris brevipedalis which lived at the same time and place. Its habitat was a richly vegetated coastal area that was dotted by ‚Äì possibly brackish ‚Äì lakes or small rivers (Chiappe 1993), and it might thus be that the present species represents a case of parallel evolution with waders and similar semi- aquatic forms, or even a running bird similar to an oversized courser, and quite unlike anything living today. It was a rather advanced species of enantiornithine and possibly quite closely related to Enantiornis and Avisaurus, but more likely closer to other Euenantiornithes (Sanz et al. 1995). Its exact relationships, as with most enantiornithine birds, are unresolved however.  References  = Bibliography = * Chiappe, Luis M.

Currently in possession of The Royal Library. Early Swedish literature designates Swedish literature written between approximately 1200-1500 AD. As Swedish evolved from Old Norse in the 13th century, the Swedish literature began to take form as an independent body of literature. The earliest form of an independent Swedish language is called Old Swedish, and it was used in the years 1225 to 1526. The period was initiated by the first provincial laws. In them, the runic Futhark was almost totally replaced by the Latin alphabet.L√∂nnroth, Delblanc, et al. The provincial laws are believed to have had a solid centuries-old foundation that was kept alive by oral tradition until they were written down. Compared to the Christianity-influenced Swedish literature during the ensuing centuries, the provincial laws are described as having a touch of the ancient folkhistory; of tradition and age.Gustafson 1961, pp.27-28 Because of the dominant Catholic Church, Latin had come to be the lingua franca for all matters of education, science and religion. Therefore, there are few traces of Old Swedish in the old medieval manuscripts. As mentioned, the most important exceptions were the provincial laws. Second to the laws come the legends of saints, popular among both commoners and scholars. These works would often be based upon the international best-seller Golden Legend (Legenda aurea), but also included biographies of many local Swedish saints.Gustafson, p.30-32 Literary writing in Swedish took a major step forward with the Eufemiavisor, translations of romances originally in Old French commissioned by the Norwegian Queen Euphemia of R√ºgen and sent to Sweden. The three ballads were titled Herr Ivan lejonriddaren (1303), Hertig Fredrik av Normandie (1301 or 1308) and Flores och Blanzeflor (probably 1312). They were followed by a translation of the Norwegian Karlamagn√∫s saga as Karl Magnus. The mid-fifteenth century also saw a Swedish verse translation Legends about Theoderic the Great of the Norwegian prose √ûi√∞reks saga. Other works need to be mentioned for their great historical importance. The Chronicle of Charles (Karlskr√∂nikan), the Chronicle of Eric (Erikskr√∂nikan) and the Chronicles of Sture (Stureskr√∂nikorna) give a coverage of the entire time of Swedish history between the early 14th to the late 15th century. The earliest and most notable of these was the Chronicle of Eric, written around 1330, focusing on the life of Duke Erik Magnusson. In term of literary quality, the chronicles were written in an unambitious rhyming verse known as knittel, without actual literary ambitions.Algulin, p.21; Gustafson, pp.41-43  Latin  Saint Birgitta receiving a revelation. Image based on a medieval illustration. Several early Swedish works were written in Latin, but they are still considered part of Swedish literature history.This done by both Gustafson (1961), Algulin (1989) and L L√∂nnroth & S. Delblanc, et al. (1984) It was the Christian field that gave birth to most literature in the ensuing centuries. The monk Petrus de Dacia (ca 1230-1290) originated from a monastery on the island Gotland, south-east Sweden. The literature for which he is best known are his letters of admiration directed to the pious woman Christine of Cologne, Germany. de Dacia is generally regarded the first Swedish writer.Algulin, 1989, p.22 In the 14th century, one notable figure stands out: Saint Birgitta, a devoted Christian mystic, who had visions of Mother Mary, Christ, or some other apostle or saint. Her complete writings were published as Revelaciones celestes in 1492, and they have since been translated to several languages.Algulin, p.23-24  Notes  References * Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. * Gustafson, Alrik A History of Swedish Literature (2 volumes), 1961. * L√∂nnroth, L., Delblanc S., G√∂ransson, S.

The German Protestant Reformation had spread to Sweden by 1520, and resulted in the Swedish Reformation in 1527. The advent of the printing press facilitated a full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. From a philological view, a new period in the development of the Swedish language called Modern Swedish was initiated with the Bible translation. It also gave power to the vernacular language. From a literary point of view, the period between 1400 and 1600 produced little of note, especially during the 1520-1600.Algulin, p.25Gustafson, p.54 Yet, paradoxically, the Bible translation published 1541 is possibly the most significant Swedish book of all times. First and foremost, it had a great religious impact, but apart from that it also introduced the common man to a language beyond the common-day.Gustafson, p.61Algulin, p.27 The Bible was used in churches for around 400 years until the Bible translation of 1917, and meanwhile translations (in 1618 and 1712) were merely revisions and corrections.Gustafson, p.26  Gothicism  From an ideological perspective, the 16th century literature gave rise to Gothicism.Algulin, p. 29 The main idea of this movement is that the Goths, a renowned East Germanic tribe in the 1st‚Äì6th century, originated from Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular. An important advocate was the deposed Swedish archbishop Johannes Magnus, who was exiled in Rome between 1530-1544 together with his brother Olaus Magnus. In Historia de omnibus gothorum suenumque regibus (1554), Johannes Magnus traced the Swedish line of kings back to the Old Testament. The works of the Magnus brothers gained attention throughout Europe and was translated into several languages, and their influence manifested itself in several works during the 17th century. Gustafson, p.64-66, p.76 hexametric Hercules, by Georg Stiernhielm, 1658 In history, Sweden was a great empire between 1611-1718\\\\. In literature, however, its development was trailing other European countries. It was by French and German influence that Swedish literature was to be shaped.Gustafson, p.77 In literature, an important turnstone occurred in 1658, when Georg Stiernhielm published Hercules, a work regarded as the first Swedish work of true poetry. The story in Hercules is based on Xenophon's story of Hercules at the crossroads of different paths. It was the first known publication of hexameter in Swedish language, and with it Stiernhielm proved that the Swedish language was up for the task. Another significant aspect of Hercules is the freedom of religious motives, drawing more upon ancient philosophy than on the Bible.Algulin, pp.34-37Gustafson, p.76-85 In the ensuing decades, Stiernhielm and his followers made further attempts at writing tragedies, pastoral poetry and other poetic styles in the Swedish language.Gustafson, p.83 Contemporary copper engraving of Olaus Rudbeck giving a fictional lecture on the location of Atlantis. The culmination of the Gothicism came with Olaus Rudbeck's Atlantica, a massive four-volume work (1679‚Äì1702), where Rudbeck outlined how Sweden was the most ancient of all countries, and the true location of the sunken Atlantis.Gustafson, p.80-81 But when the last volume of Atlantica was published, the Gothicism movement was already on decline. This was for large part a natural reaction to the failed Swedish wars. By 1720, Gothicism was a thing of the past, and Swedish culture took a turn towards science and realism.Gustafson, p.80  Hymns  An ecclesiastical body of literature affected by Gothicism was the Swedish hymn production of the late 17th century. The first official Swedish hymn book was published in 1695. It is attributed to the bishop Jesper Svedberg (1653-1753), assisted by the bishop (and later archbishop) Haqvin Spegel. The hymns used an unsophisticated language to the common people, but apart from fulfilling the dire need for a uniform hymn literature, they also gave the commoners greater access to a standardized language. Svedberg was a strong advocate of the strength and high status of Swedish. In fact, he was the last strong proponent and new-thinker of his kind. The hymn book became widespread and beloved in sermons all over Sweden for a full century (the new hymn book was not published until 1819), and its weight cannot be overestimated. But the Gothicism ideals on which it was based had become superseded with the dawn of the 18th century.Algulin, p.37 See also   References  =Bibliography= * Algulin, Ingemar, A History of Swedish Literature, published by the Swedish Institute, 1989. * Gustafson, Alrik A History of Swedish Literature (2 volumes), 1961. * L√∂nnroth, L., Delblanc S., G√∂ransson, S.

Tack Sam (September 16, 1884 ‚Äì August 7, 1961) was a Chinese-born American magician, acrobat, and vaudeville performer. Early life and career Mi-na Long circa 1920 Long Tack Sam, also known as Tack Sam Long and Sam Tack Long, was the stage name of performance artist Lung Te Shan. He was born in Wuqiao County, an area of Shandong Province in Northeast China that is internationally understood to be the birthplace of Chinese acrobatics.Vaudeville Old and New by Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman, Donald McNeilly - 2007 pg. 700Index to Petitions for Naturalization filed in New York City, 1792-1989 Record for Sam Tack Long (1954)Passenger Manifest SS President McKinley Sept. 6, 1932Reports of Deaths of American Citizens (Sam Tack Long) August 7, 1961 On most official documents during his life in America, he used Sam Tack Long as his legal name. Little is known about Long's early years; what is known is that he joined a group acrobats around the turn of the century called the Tian-Kwai and went on world tour. Several years later with unrest in his homeland, Long brought his own troupe of entertainers to America,Sessional indexes to the Annals of Congress: Register of Debates, Volume 2 By United States Historical Documents Institute< (1908) where he soon found success. His magnificently dressed troupe went on to play major cities across the globe in the first decades of the twentieth century. Although largely forgotten as a performer by contemporary audiences, he was considered one of the \\"greatest vaudeville acts of the early 20th century\\". Long's career brought him to the opening act for the Marx Brothers and he even became a mentor to Orson Welles. In 1922, he became a member of Houdini's Magicians Club. Bennett Cerf once wrote of an incident of theater lore that occurred at the Palace Theatre in New York when entertainer Bert Fitzgibbon became enraged upon learning Long was billed above him in the night‚Äôs card, meaning that he was scheduled to follow the magician on stage.Winona Daily News (Minnesota) Friday, October 11, 1957, p. 6. Later that night as Long was ending his show, Fitzgibbon walked on stage and handed him a bundle of dirty shirts and reportedly said, \\"I want these back by Saturday night and go easy on the starch!\\" Long responded with an uppercut, resulting in Fitzgibbon being carried off stage as the audience applauded and roared their approval. It is unclear whether or not Fitzgibbon was able to make his appointed curtain call. In 1958, Long‚Äôs final performance was also staged in New York, at the Roxy Theater. He performed his famous water bowl trick, in which he did a somersault, at age 73, and ended standing with a goldfish bowl in his left hand. Personal life and death After decades of performing and traveling extensively around the world, Long and his wife Leopoldi (known as Poldi), a native of Ybbs, Austria, retired to New York City.Reports of Deaths of American Citizens (Poldi Long) September 6, 1963 Long was also a Freemason and achieved the notable step of 32nd degree within the fraternal order.Asian and Asian American Magicians He presumably maintained his associations with the order while residing in New York. Later, following a bad car accident, he and Poldi went to Linz, Austria, not far from her hometown. Long Tack Sam died there in 1961 at the age of 76. Poldi died in Vienna two years later. Documentary film The greatest source of historical information available of Long Tack Sam's life comes from a Canadian documentary The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam.NFB collections page, Long Tack Sam Written, directed, researched and animated by Long's great-granddaughter Ann Marie Fleming, the story is an in-depth research of the magician's life. Through six years of research, and the assistance of several magic historians, Fleming uncovered many missing holes in the historical narrative of her great-grandfather's life. Illustrated memoir In September 2007, The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam: an Illustrated Memoir by Ann Marie Fleming was published by Riverhead Books, a division of Penguin Publishing. The book expands on the information in the biographical film, and puts Long Tack Sam's life in a more historical context. In 2008, the book won The Doug Wright Award for best book.

The collection was first published in hardcover by Nelson Doubleday in 1975 as an offering for its Science Fiction Book Club, and was reissued in paperback by Del Rey Books in 1976. Minus the essay, it has more recently been combined with Wall of Serpents (1960), the third book of the series in the omnibus edition The Complete Compleat Enchanter (1989). This book had been left out of The Compleat Enchanter due to \\"considerations of space and ‚Ä¶contractual considerations\\".Afterword, p. 338. The stories in the collection were originally published in the magazine Unknown in the issues for May and August 1940 and April 1941. The Harold Shea stories are parallel world tales in which universes where magic works coexist with our own, and in which those based on the mythologies, legends, and literary fantasies of our world and can be reached by aligning one's mind to them by a system of symbolic logic. Psychologist Harold Shea and his colleagues Reed Chalmers, Walter Bayard, and Vaclav Polacek (\\"Votsy), travel to several such worlds, joined in the course of their adventures by Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie, who become the wives of Shea and Chalmers, and Pete Brodsky, a policeman who is accidentally swept up into the chaos.

Similar to GPS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to triangulate its position accurately (¬±5 km).

If this is successful, XNAV may be used as secondary navigation technology for the planned Orion missions. In January 2018, X-ray navigation feasibility was demonstrated using NICER/SEXTANT on ISS.

The area between Charterhouse and Cheddar Gorge including Velvet Bottom and Ubley Warren is covered by the Cheddar Complex Site of Special Scientific Interest.  Name  The name is believed to come from the Carthusian order of Chartreuse in France, which was established in Witham (near Frome) in 1181 and formed a cell at Charterhouse in 1283 with a grant to mine lead ore.  History  Roman lead mines at Charterhouse There is evidence, in the form of burials in local caves, of human occupation since the late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age. The lead and silver mines at Charterhouse, were first operated on a large scale by the Romans, from at least AD 49. At first the lead/silver industries were tightly controlled by the Roman military, but within a short time the extraction of these metals was contracted out to civilian companies, probably because the silver content of the local ore was not particularly high. There was also some kind of 'fortlet' here in the 1st century, and an amphitheatre. The Roman landscape has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. After the dissolution of the monasteries, it was granted to Robert May who constructed a substantial house here and one of his descendants John May became High Sheriff of Somerset in 1602. There is further evidence of mine workings in the medieval and Victorian periods, some of which survives within the Blackmoor Nature Reserve owned by Somerset County Council. There is also evidence of a rectangular medieval enclosure.  AONB Centre  The outdoor activity centre and headquarters of the Mendip Hills schools around the area stay here for residentials it includes accommodation, classrooms and offices.  Caves  There are several caves in the limestone around the village including Manor Farm Swallet and Upper Flood Swallet.  Church  Church of St Hugh, Charterhouse The Church Of St Hugh was built in 1908 by W.D. Caroe, on the initiative of the Rev. Menzies Lambrick, from the former welfare hall for the lead miners. It is a Grade II* listed building. A cross in the churchyard and the churchyard wall are also listed buildings. The roof-truss, screen, rood, and altar are all made of carved whitened oak.

The mountain should not confused with another Stob B√†n, also a Munro which is located in the Grey Corries above Spean Bridge. Stob B√†n has three main ridges: the east ridge connects to the former Munro of Sgor an Iubhair via the top of the Coire a' Mhusgain (Corrie of the Shellfish), the western ridge links to the adjoining Munro of Mullach nan Coirean while the northern ridge drops steeply to Glen Nevis over a series of terraced rocky outcrops. There is a less significant fourth ridge which gives a steep descent south west to the West Highland Way en route from Kinlochleven to Fort William and is quick way off the mountain for walkers who have approached from the south.

In the theory of ordinary differential equations, a movable singularity is a point where the solution of the equation behaves badly and which is \\"movable\\" in the sense that its location depends on the initial conditions of the differential equation. Suppose we have an ordinary differential equation in the complex domain. Any given solution y(x) of this equation may well have singularities at various points (i.e. points at which it is not a regular holomorphic function, such as branch points, essential singularities or poles). A singular point is said to be movable if its location depends on the particular solution we have chosen, rather than being fixed by the equation itself. For example the equation : \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\frac{1}{2y} has solution y=\\\\sqrt{x-c} for any constant c. This solution has a branchpoint at x=c, and so the equation has a movable branchpoint (since it depends on the choice of the solution, i.e. the choice of the constant c). It is a basic feature of linear ordinary differential equations that singularities of solutions occur only at singularities of the equation, and so linear equations do not have movable singularities. When attempting to look for 'good' nonlinear differential equations it is this property of linear equations that one would like to see: asking for no movable singularities is often too stringent, instead one often asks for the so-called Painlev√© property: 'any movable singularity should be a pole', first used by Sofia Kovalevskaya.

Namur, sitting on the confluence of the Meuse and Sambre rivers, was a considerable fortress, and was a significant political and military asset. French forces, guided by Vauban, forced the town's surrender on 5 June, but the citadel, staunchly defended by Menno van Coehoorn, managed to hold on until 30 June before capitulating, bringing an end to the 36-day siege. Concerned that King William III planned to recapture the stronghold, King Louis XIV subsequently ordered his commander-in-chief, the duc de Luxembourg, to join battle with the Allies in the field, resulting in the bloody Battle of Steenkerque on 3 August. Background Detail of a contemporary map of the Spanish Netherlands that shows the limit of French conquests (in pink) shortly before the start of the campaign of Namur. As in 1691, five large armies were created for the five major fronts of the war: Flanders, the Moselle, the Rhine, Piedmont, and Roussillon. To these was added a further force in Flanders to attack what was to be France's major goal for 1692, the important Sambre‚ÄìMeuse fortress of Namur. The capture of the fortress would not only give control of the vicinity to France, but it might also inspire the Dutch to make peace; if its capture did not lead to immediate talks, it would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations.Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 573. To deter William from marching to the town's relief, Louis arranged for a simultaneous landing in England to assist King James II in his attempt to regain his throne. This force consisted of 12,000 Catholic Irish troops, released after the conclusion of the Irish war under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick, supported by a similar number of French troops. However, an essential preliminary to the invasion was the acquisition of naval supremacy in the English Channel.Childs: Warfare in the Seventeenth Century, p. 192. Siege Louis, accompanied by individuals of the court, left Versailles for Flanders on 10 May.The members of Louis' entourage included the poet and dramatist Jean Racine. French cavalry invested the town on the night of 25‚Äì26 May; the main army arrived the following day. The French forces were even larger than Louis had gathered for the Siege of Mons the previous year: the besieging army amounted some 60,000 men and 151 guns; the duc de Luxembourg's army of observation ‚Äì designed to prevent William coming to Namur's assistance ‚Äì also had about 60,000 men. Namur's garrison, under the command of Octavius Ignatius, Prince of Arenberg and Barban√ßon, totalled approximately 6,000.Lynn: The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714, p. 225. =Fall of the town= The Siege of Namur in 1692 was a particularly notable operation of King Louis‚Äô reign. First, the action involved the two great military engineers of the day: Vauban, who oversaw the siege, and the Dutch engineer, Menno van Coehoorn, who directed the defences of the stronghold. Second, the location and topography of the position made the siege particularly challenging. The actual town of Namur sat on low, flat land on the north bank of the Sambre, dominated by heights on all sides. But by reason of the position of its citadel (a complex of fortifications occupying the height on the south bank between the confluence of the Sambre and Meuse), it was one of the strongest frontiers in Flanders.La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, p. 15. Vauban had secretly reconnoitred Namur the year before and managed to draw up plans of the town's defences. Guided by these drawings, the French constructed lines of circumvallation, and positioned several large, well-equipped batteries; trenches for three lines of advance opened on the night of 29‚Äì30 May. William, meanwhile, moved his forces southwest closer to Namur, whilst Luxembourg moved his army of observation east from Gembloux to Longchamps, north of the town. William hoped to bring Luxembourg to battle on the Mehaigne, but the rain-swollen river had made a crossing impossible. Most of the garrison of Namur were Spanish troops, weak and in poor condition.La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, p. 16. The garrison managed a small sortie to reinforce a battery covering the main town, but it met with limited success. Offering little resistance the town capitulated on 5 June, at which time it was agreed there would be a truce until the morning of 7 June. During this respite the garrison crossed over to the citadel complex, and the French entered the town. It was also agreed that during the rest of the siege the Allies would not fire down on the town from the heights, and, for their part, the French would not attack the citadel from that direction. In his memoirs, Jean Martin de la Colonie, a participant of the siege wrote, \\"It was through ignorance of the true state of the fortifications that these articles were agreed to, as it is only from the town side that the fortress could be taken, the rest being almost impregnable.\\" Vauban, King Louis XIV‚Äôs greatest military engineer. =Fall of the citadel= The river Sambre separates the citadel and the town; the weakest side of the citadel lies along this river, but due to the terms of the truce signed at the surrender of the town, the French could not attack from this direction. The section of the citadel overlooking the Meuse is on a rocky height and is inaccessible and impossible to attack.La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, p. 17. The key to the citadel, therefore, was Fort William (named after William of Orange who had built it), positioned to the west of the other main strongpoints. It was in this direction that the French were obliged to attack, (see map). river Meuse running south‚Äìnorth). The first task for the attackers was to take the outlying redoubt of La Cachotte, which covered the approaches to Fort William. The trench was opened on 8 June; a major assault ‚Äì consisting of seven battalions, accompanied by the King's Musketeers ‚Äì followed on 12 June. La Cachotte fell, and Vauban turned to seizing Fort William, which was personally defended by Coehoorn. The fort was well sited, just over the crest of the rise, obscuring the stronghold from the attackers until they were almost upon it, and masking its walls from artillery fire.Lynn: The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714, p. 226. French sappers approached from two directions, but the recent heavy rain had made the whole operation extremely difficult. In a dramatic gesture, Coehoorn ordered his own grave dug to symbolise his commitment to defend the position to the end, but although his grave was not needed, the Dutch engineer was wounded in the head by a shell that killed his valet. The final assault on Fort William came on 22 June; despite Coehoorn's resolute defence, he and the 200 men who had garrisoned the fort, capitulated. Vauban greeted his rival the next day, consoling him that at least he had, \\" ‚Ä¶ the honour of being attacked by the greatest king in the world.\\" To which Coehoorn replied that his real consolation was in the fact that he had forced his great rival to move his siege batteries seven times during the assault. Due to the heavy rain the roads had become virtually impassable, greatly restricting the supply of ammunition to the French gun batteries. Saint-Simon writes, \\"It sometimes took as much as three days to move a cannon from one battery to another. The wagons were unusable, and shells, cannon-balls, etc., had to be transported on mules and horses ‚Ä¶ Without them nothing would have been possible.\\"Saint-Simon: Memoirs: 1691‚Äì1709 vol. i, p. 7. But the surrounding country, much of it woodland, provided so little forage that the French were forced to feed their animals on leaves and branches, resulting in many losses. Hampered in this way, and lacking ammunition, Vauban had sought permission from the King to renege on their earlier treaty and attack the citadel from the side of the town; an act that, in Vauban's opinion, would be less disgraceful than raising the siege.La Colonie: The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, p. 19. However, after Fort William fell, the other works did not hold out long. The final capitulation came on 30 June; the remainder of the garrison left on 1 July. To Saint-Simon, who was at the siege, this came none too soon for the besiegers, \\" ‚Ä¶ whose strength and provisions were nearly exhausted on account of the continual rain that had turned everything to a quagmire.\\"Saint-Simon: Memoirs: 1691‚Äì1709 vol. i, p. 8. Aftermath Louis and his entourage left Namur on 2 July and reached Versailles two weeks later. The King ordered Te Deums of thanksgiving for the victory, but in the words of historian John Wolf, he may have neglected the work of his engineers when he wrote, \\"the gloire of so great a victory belong to God alone ‚Ä¶\\"Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 574. But although Louis had secured a great victory at Namur, the proposed descent on England was a failure. Defeat at the Battle of La Hogue in early June had denied the French naval superiority in the English Channel, thus ending any hopes of a landing. The Irish troops destined for England marched off to the Rhineland; the French troops joined the army in Flanders or were deployed to coastal defence. Luxembourg waited while Namur was put into a state of defence before decamping on 8 July, following William III towards Nivelles. News arrived at Versailles that William was planning the recapture of Namur as soon as the Allied commander could assemble his army.Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 575. Louis wrote to Luxembourg, urging him to \\" ‚Ä¶ march with speed ‚Ä¶ and fight him before he can establish his trenches [before Namur] ‚Ä¶ \\" On 1 August William moved to Halle. William, like Louis, also sought battle, and on 3 August he surprised and attacked Luxembourg near the village of Steenkerque. The issue was not completely decisive ‚Äì both sides could claim a victory of sorts ‚Äì but William left the field in French hands, thus ending the Allied threat to Namur. Little of note happened in the remainder of the campaign before they went into winter quarters. Notes References =Primary= *La Colonie, Jean Martin de. The Chronicles of an Old Campaigner, (trans. W.

Its capture by the French in the 1692 and recapture by the Grand Alliance in 1695 are often viewed as the defining events of the war; the second siege is considered to be William III's most significant military success.  Background  After 1693, Louis XIV assumed a largely defensive posture in Flanders. French victories at Steinkirk and Landen and the capture of Namur, Mons, Huy and Charleroi failed to force the Dutch Republic out of the war. The cost had exhausted the French economy with crop failures in 1693 and 1694 causing widespread famine in France and Northern Italy. The Dutch Republic remained intact and the Alliance held together under William through four years of war. Their losses were damaging but not critical; in 1694, they had recaptured towns like Huy and Diksmuide, and by 1695 held a numerical advantage for the first time. However, the Allies had also reached the limit of their resources. The 1690s marked the lowest point of the so-called Little Ice Age, a period of cold and wet weather affecting Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Spain and Scotland in particular experienced famine; the harvest failed in 1695, 1696, 1698 and 1699 and an estimated 5-15% of the population starved to death. Citadel of Namur above the Meuse, modern Parlement de Wallonie below While this theatre is commonly referred to as Flanders, most campaigning took place in the Spanish Netherlands, a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, and dominated by canals and rivers. In the 17th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water and the war was fought for control of rivers such as the Lys, Sambre and Meuse. Retaking Namur became the key objective for 1695 as its location between the Sambre and Meuse made it a vital part of the \\"Barrier\\" system. This was a chain of fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands the Dutch viewed as essential for defence against French invasion and possession would be extremely advantageous in any peace negotiations. The French commander in Flanders, Marshall Luxembourg, died in January 1695 and was replaced by the less talented Villeroi. French strategy for 1695 was to remain on the defensive and Boufflers spent April constructing entrenchments between the rivers Scheldt and Lys, from Coutrai/Kortrijk to Avelgem. William marched on these in June with the bulk of the Allied force but secretly detached Frederick of Prussia to Namur. Once Frederick was in place on 2 July, William joined him; the Allies were now split into a besieging force of 58,000 at Namur and a field army of 102,000 under Prince Vaud√©mont to cover Villeroi.  Siege  Namur was divided into the 'City,' with the residential and commercial areas, and the Citadel that controlled access to the Sambre and Meuse rivers. In 1692, the Dutch military engineer Menno van Coehoorn made the Citadel one of the strongest defensive points in Flanders, but the garrison was less than 5,000, many of them poorly-trained Spanish troops with low morale. While the outer City fell relatively quickly, capturing the Citadel took the French over a month and they were nearly forced to withdraw by torrential rain and sickness. This was partly due to the terms negotiated for surrendering the City; van Coehoorn agreed not to fire on the City from the Citadel, in return for the French agreeing not to attack him from that direction, making it almost impregnable.de la Colonie, p. 16 After its capture, Namur's defences were significantly upgraded by Vauban, while Boufflers had a garrison of 13,000, making it a formidable challenge. During July, the Allies battered their way into the City, both sides incurring heavy casualties; by early August, half the French garrison had been lost.Lenihan, pp. 10‚Äì11 On 3 August, Count Guiscard, Governor of Namur, surrendered the City to Maximilian of Bavaria and asked for a truce to allow the French to withdraw to the Citadel. This was accepted and the siege resumed after six days. Menno van Coehoorn Vaud√©mont's role was to keep his field army between Villeroi and Namur, while Villeroi tried to tempt him out of position by attacking Allied- held towns like Knokke and Beselare, now Zonnebeke. Vaud√©mont refused to be drawn since both sides knew the longer the siege went on, the more likely Namur was to fall. Villeroi's attempts to out-manoeuvre Vaud√©mont were unsuccessful, despite the capture of Diksmuide and Deinze in late July with 6,000 - 7,000 prisoners. The Bombardment of Brussels between 13‚Äì15 August also failed to divert the Allies, despite destroying large parts of the commercial centre; Constantijn Huygens, William's Secretary for Dutch affairs, visited Brussels on 11 September and recorded that the 'ruin caused...was horrible...and in many places, the houses reduced to rubble.' By mid-August, the Citadel was largely intact, Villeroi was making resupply much more difficult, while the besiegers were beginning to lose men to disease, in an age when far more soldiers died from illness than in battle. The Allies were running out of time and Coehoorn and William now agreed a new approach; a battery of 200 guns was established in Namur city and on 21 August began a continuous 24-hour bombardment of the Citadel's lower defences. Boufflers later told Louis it was 'the most prodigious artillery ever assembled' and by 26 August the Allies were ready to assault the Citadel. At midnight on 27th, Villeroi finally made contact with Vaud√©mont but his numerical advantage of 120,000 to 102,000 was offset by their strongly entrenched positions. Having failed to outflank the Allied lines, Villeroi retreated and William gave the order for a general assault.Lenihan, pp. 20‚Äì21 The assaults by the Allies were extremely bloody, that of 30 August alone costing 3,000 men in less than three hours but the defenders were eventually forced back to their final lines of defence. Count Guiscard, now commanding the key outwork of Fort Orange, told Boufflers on 2 September they could not repulse another attack and the garrison surrendered on 4 September, having suffered 8,000 casualties to the Allies 12,000.  Aftermath  The Bombardment of Brussels; the deliberate destruction of a non-military target shocked many in Europe, where all sides were tired of the war's cost. The recapture of Namur was a major achievement for the Allies but Bouffler's energetic defence prevented them taking advantage of French weakness elsewhere, an achievement recognised by Louis promoting him to Field-Marshall.Young, p. 230 Neither side was capable of mounting an offensive in 1696 and serious fighting came to an end, although Louis made one final demonstration prior to the signing of the Treaty of Ryswick in September 1697. De Villeroi, Luxembourg's successor as French commander in Flanders. Namur showcased Coehoorn's offensive tactics and also the defensive precepts set out in his 1685 work New Fortress Construction or Nieuwe Vestingbouw op een natte of lage horisont. These can be summarised as follows; (1) passive reliance on fortifications was not enough and (b) in trying to hold an entire town, defenders simply risked losing it very quickly. This meant dividing fortifications into inner (Citadel) and outer (City) and conducting an 'active' defence that used constant counter attacks to keep the besiegers off guard. Bouffler applied these concepts but jeopardised his defence by committing too many troops to the outer City without means of retreat.Lenihan, p. 290 He would apply these lessons at the Siege of Lille in 1708. Historian John Lynn summarised his defence of Namur as follows; (He) demonstrated one could effectively win a campaign by losing a fortress, provided you pinned down and exhausted the besieging force in the process. He conducted a classic active defence, launching attacks by the garrison on the enemy's siege works, contesting every advance as best he could.Lynn, pp. 248‚Äì249 Prisoners were normally exchanged as soon as possible, partly because neither side wanted the expense of having to feed them.Childs, p. 37 On this occasions, the French refused William's request for the return of the 6,000 - 7,000 troops captured at Diksmuide and Deinze due to a dispute over the terms of their surrender.Childs, p. 40 By now, shortage of manpower was a problem for all combatants; many of the rank and file were forcibly enlisted into French regiments and sent to fight in Italy or Catalonia.Bright, p. 295 Desertion from one army to another to receive a signing-on bonus was common, particularly as these were paid immediately and wages were often months in arrears. As recruiters were paid for each man they enlisted, several thousand additional soldiers represented significant profits for the French officers involved. In retaliation, despite the garrison of Namur being allowed to surrender on terms, Boufflers was taken prisoner and released only when the remaining Allied prisoners had been returned in September. Legacy Tristram Shandy; Uncle Toby recounting the Siege to Widow Wadman While the Bombardment of Brussels failed to distract the Allies, some see it as marking the end of a period where the dominant form of warfare was taking or holding fortifications.Childs, p. 2 By demonstrating fortified towns could no longer resist the massive firepower available in modern warfare, it led to a move away from siege warfare and into the direct confrontations advocated by Marlborough and others in the War of the Spanish Succession.Dekker, p. 45 The assault by 3,000 British troops on the Terra Nova earthwork on 31 August spearheaded by 700 grenadiers is alleged to have been the inspiration for the song 'The British Grenadiers.' The Siege and its aftermath is the centre of the novel Mother Ross; an Irish Amazon by GR Lloyd. This is an update of Daniel Defoe's original that purports to be the story of Christian 'Kit' Cavanagh alias Christian Davies, an Irish woman who enlisted in the British Army in 1693 disguised as a man and was present at the Siege. Defoe claims to have met her in old age when she was a Chelsea Pensioner; it contains a number of factual errors but is an interesting and rare observation of the Siege from the rank and file. Laurence Sterne's 1760 novel Tristram Shandy refers to a number of events from the Nine Years War, including Namur where Tristram's uncle Toby suffered an unspecified 'groin injury.' He and his trusted servant Corporal Trim build a replica of the battle in his garden which he shows to his fianc√©e Widow Wadman among others. The Widow tries to determine how serious Toby's injury is before committing to marriage but he avoids her questions by providing increasingly elaborate accounts of the siege. This episode and Toby's reconstruction appear in the 2006 film A Cock and Bull Story. Fourteen British regiments earned a battle honour for \\"Namur 1695\\" including the Grenadier, Coldstream and Scots Guards, the Royal Scots, the King's Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers, the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey), the East Yorkshire Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment, the King's Own Royal Regiment and the King's Own Royal Border Regiment.

History =Foundation= Earls Colne Grammar School was founded in 1520 when Christopher Swallow, vicar of Messing endowed land in trust to the Earl of Oxford, the income from which was to support a schoolmaster to teach Latin to thirty boys. In 1673 the last Earl of Oxford sold the school estates to members of the Cressener family, who thereby became patrons of the school. Under a succession of clergymen- headmasters the school had achieved a high reputation by the mid 18th century, but the majority of pupils were the fee paying sons of local minor gentry. As a result the patron decided to change the school from curriculum from a classical based one to one giving an elementary education in reading, writing and accounts which, he maintained, would be more useful to the local boys for whose benefit the school had been endowed. This situation remained until the school was closed in 1837 after an investigation by the Charity Commission revealed evidence of mis-management. It re-opened in 1843 under a new scheme by which the estates were transferred to eleven trustees drawn from the local clergy and gentry. It was still called a Free Grammar School but fees of 6d a week were charged and the thirty pupils were given a clerks education up to the age of 14 only. In 1868 the Taunton Commission, investigating endowed grammar schools, was in turn critical of the 1843 scheme. A site for a permanent building was bought in 1876 and plans to amalgamate several local educational charities and establish a central Colne Valley School in Halstead were defeated by local opposition. In 1883 the school was temporarily closed to allow funds to accumulate. A new scheme was drawn up to provide a grammar school education on modern and scientific lines and building began in 1892. =New buildings= In 1904 a master's house, boarding house, laboratories and other buildings had been added, towards the cost of which R. H. Hunt contributed more than ¬£6,000. When Halstead Grammar School was converted to a girls' school its boys were transferred to Earls Colne bringing the numbers up to 90. By 1926 there were 135 boys on the roll but the numbers dropped alarmingly during the depression. A new policy adopted in 1935 whereby the school was to adopt an agricultural bias arrested the decline. =Voluntary control= By the Education Act 1944 the school chose Voluntary controlled status and the County development plan envisaged it as a school for 150 boys aged 11 to 18 with places for 30 boarders. =Closure= In fact numbers continued to grow as facilities and curriculum were extended and reached 230 by 1958. However the school was closed in July 1975 through the re- organisation of County schools on comprehensive lines, being merged with various other local schools into The Ramsey School (now The Ramsey Academy) in Halstead.

It is based in Maplewood, a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesota. 3M made $32.8 billion in total sales in 2018, and ranked number 95 in the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. , the company had approximately 93,500 employees, and had operations in more than 70 countries. In 2016, a complaint was filed against 3M for knowingly selling defective earplugs issued to military personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. These earplugs may have caused permanent hearing damage. 3M paid a $9.1 million settlement to the U.S. government. History Five businessmen founded the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company as a mining venture in Two Harbors, Minnesota, making their first sale on June 13, 1902. The goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value. Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905. The company moved to Duluth and began researching and producing sandpaper products. William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A. G. Bush joined in 1909. 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends. The company moved to St. Paul in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in Maplewood, Minnesota in 1962. The John Dwan Office Building, where 3M was founded, now a museum =Expansion and modern history= In 1947, 3M began producing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) by electrochemical fluorination. In 1951, DuPont started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion-dollar-a-year profit by the 1990s. DuPont referred to PFOA as C8. The original formula for Scotchgard, a water repellent applied to fabrics, was discovered accidentally in 1952 by 3M chemists Patsy Sherman and Samuel Smith. Sales began in 1956, and in 1973 the two chemists received a patent for the formula. In the late 1950s, 3M produced the first asthma inhaler, but the company did not enter the pharmaceutical industry per se until the mid-1960s with the acquisition of Riker Laboratories, moving it from California to Minnesota. 3M retained the name Riker Laboratories for the subsidiary until at least 1985. In the mid-1990s, 3M Pharmaceuticals, as the division came to be called, produced the first CFC-free asthma inhaler in response to adoption of the Montreal Protocol by the United States. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company spent fifteen years developing a topical cream delivery technology which led in 1997 to health authority approval and marketing of a symptomatic treatment for genital herpes, Aldara. After four decades, 3M divested its pharmaceutical unit through three deals in 2006, netting more than . At the time, 3M Pharmaceuticals comprised about 20% of 3M's health care business and employed just over a thousand people. 3M traffic signals installed in Shelton, Washington. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals are invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic in daylight. (A faint glow is visible at night.) The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication. By the 1970s, 3M developed a theatrical blood formula based on red colorfast microbeads suspended in a carrier liquid. This stage blood was sold under the name of Nextel Simulated Blood, and was used during the production of the 1978 film Dawn of the Dead. It has since been discontinued. 3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. In 1979 3M introduced a digital audio recording system called the \\"3M Digital Audio Mastering System\\". 3M launched \\"Press 'n Peel\\" in stores in four cities in 1977, but results were disappointing. A year later 3M instead issued free samples directly to consumers in Boise, Idaho, with 95% of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product. The product was sold as \\"Post-its\\" in 1979 when the rollout introduction began, and was sold across the United States from April 6, 1980. The following year they were launched in Canada and Europe. On its 100th anniversary, 3M changed its legal name to \\"3M Company\\" on April 8, 2002. On September 8, 2008, 3M announced an agreement to acquire Meguiar's, a car-care products company that was family-owned for over a century. On August 30, 2010, 3M announced that they had acquired Cogent Systems for $943 million. On October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc. In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company. As of 2012, 3M was one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, added on August 9, 1976, and was 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list. On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of Avery Dennison was being bought by 3M for $550 million. The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns. In May 2013, 3M announced that it was selling Scientific Anglers and Ross Reels to Orvis. Ross Reels had been acquired by 3M in 2010. In March 2017, it was announced that 3M was purchasing Johnson Control International Plc's safety gear business, Scott Safety, for $2 billion. In 2017, 3M had net sales for the year of $31.657 billion, up from $30.109 billion the year before. In 2018, it was reported that the company would pay $850 million to end the Minnesota water pollution case concerning perfluorochemicals. On May 25, 2018, Michael F. Roman was appointed CEO by the board of directors. There are a few international subsidiaries such as 3M India, 3M Japan, & 3M Canada. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/66740/000155837017000479/mmm-20161231ex215bcecc3.htm On December 19, 2018, 3M announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the technology business of M*Modal, for a total enterprise value of $1.0 billion. In October 2019, 3M completed the purchase of Acelity and its KCI subsidiaries worldwide for $6.7 billion, including assumption of debt and other adjustments. Environmental record Target headquarters in Minneapolis. 3M's Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) program was established in 1975. The program initially focused on pollution reduction at the plant level and was expanded to promote recycling and reduce waste across all divisions in 1989. By the early 1990s, approximately 2,500 3P projects decreased the company's total global pollutant generation by 50 percent and saved 3M $500‚Äì600 million by eliminating the production of waste requiring subsequent treatment. In 1983, the Oakdale Dump in Oakdale, Minnesota, was listed as an EPA Superfund site after significant groundwater and soil contamination by VOCs and heavy metals was uncovered. The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s. During the 1990s and 2000s, 3M reduced releases of toxic pollutants by 99 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 72 percent. The company earned the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Award each year the honor was presented, as of 2012. In 1999, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). These materials are part of a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances often referred to as PFAS, each of which has different chemical properties. 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000. Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M have been used in non-stick cookware, stain-resistant fabrics, and other products. The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFAS from the 1940s to 2002. In response to PFAS contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be \\"cleaned through a combination of groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation\\". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands. The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing PFAS, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River. The clean-up cost estimate, which included a granular activated carbon system to remove PFAS from the ground water was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006. In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management. In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M for 5 billion in punitive damages, claiming they released PFCs‚Äîclassified a toxic chemical by the EPA‚Äîinto local waterways. A settlement for $850 million was reached in February 2018, although in 2019, 3M, along with the Chemours Company and DuPont, appeared before lawmakers to deny responsibility, with company Senior VP of Corporate Affairs Denise Rutherford arguing that the chemicals pose no human health threats at current levels and have no victims.  Earplug controversy  The Combat Arms Earplugs, Version 2 (CAE v2), was developed by Aearo Technologies for U.S. military and civilian use. The CAE v2 was a double ended earplug that 3M claimed would offer users different levels of protection. Between 2003 and 2015, these earplugs were standard issue to members of the U.S. military. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008. In May 2016, Moldex-Metric, Inc., a 3M competitor, filed a whistleblower complaint against 3M under the False Claims Act. Moldex-Metric claimed that 3M made false claims to the U.S. government about the safety of its earplugs, and that it knew the earplugs had an inherently defective design. In 2018, 3M agreed to pay $9.1 million to the U.S government to resolve the allegations, without admitting liability. Since 2018, more than 140,000 former users of the earplugs‚Äîprimarily U.S. military veterans‚Äîhave filed suit against 3M claiming they suffer from hearing loss, tinnitus, and other damage as a consequence of the defective design. Internal emails showed that 3M officials boasted about charging $7.63 per piece for the earplugs which cost 85 cents to produce. The company's official response indicated that the cost to the government includes R&D; costs.  N95 respirators and the COVID-19 pandemic  The N95 respirator mask was developed by 3M and approved in 1972. Being able to filter viral particulates, its use was recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic but supply soon became short. Much of the company's supply had already been sold prior to the outbreak. The shortages lead to the US government asking 3M to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and to Latin American countries, and President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to require 3M to prioritize orders from the federal government. The dispute was resolved when 3M agreed to import more respirators, mostly from its factories in China. 3M later struck a $70MCAD deal with the federal government of Canada and the Ontario provincial government to produce N95 masks at their plant in Brockville, Ontario. Operating facilities 3M facility in St. Paul, Minnesota 3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and some division laboratories in the US are in St. Paul, Minnesota. In the United States, 3M operates 80 manufacturing facilities in 29 states, and 125 manufacturing and converting facilities in 37 countries outside the US (in 2017). In March 2016, 3M completed a research-and-development building that cost $150 million on its Maplewood campus. Seven hundred scientists from various divisions occupy the building. They were previously scattered across the campus. 3M hopes concentrating its research and development in this manner will improve collaboration. 3M received $9.6 million in local tax increment financing and relief from state sales taxes in order to assist with development of the building.

Margherita Durastanti (active 1700‚Äì1734) was an Italian singer of the 18th century. Vocally, she is best described as a soprano, though later in her career her tessitura descended to that of a mezzo-soprano. First heard of professionally in Mantua in 1700‚Äì01, she later appeared in Bologna and Reggio Emilia (1710), Milan and Reggio (1713) and Florence (1715). Today she is particularly remembered for her association with the composer George Frideric Handel: indeed she enjoyed a longer personal association with the composer than any other musician. As well as performing many of his early Italian solo cantatas, Durastanti's first roles for Handel included Mary Magdalene in his oratorio La resurrezione (1708) and the title role in Agrippina (1709), in her capacity as prima donna of the S Giovanni Grisostomo Theatre in Venice, where she sang from 1709 to 1712. After singing at Parma, Florence, Naples (where she appeared in operas by Scarlatti), and, in 1719, Dresden, she came to London in 1720. News of her imminent arrival evinced the following unflattering comment from the librettist Rolli: However, she received a strong recommendation from Steffan Benedetto Pallavicini, court poet at Dresden: She was offered her contract by the Royal Academy company rather late in the day, so was probably not the Academy's first choice as a member of it. Handel on the other hand stayed in Dresden until her contract arrived. The roles Handel wrote for her during the next five years demonstrate her considerable abilities as a musician and actress, displaying a wide range of characters, both male and female, and an ability to cope with wide dissonant leaps in vocal lines and other difficulties, such as chromaticism and dramatic pauses. First period in England Though engaged as the first prima donna in the new company, she in effect began as primo uomo (\\"first man\\"), creating the name-part in Radamisto in April 1720. She was gradually demoted as more vocally gifted singers arrived, though even her lower-status roles, such as that of Sesto in Giulio Cesare (1724) made considerable vocal and theatrical demands. In 1721 she gave birth to a girl, and King George I and the Princess Royal were among the child's godparents; in the autumn of that year she sang in Germany, and then in Italy during the spring of 1722. She returned to London in October 1722, but found herself superseded as \\"first woman\\" by the new sensation Francesca Cuzzoni. Clearly not particularly disconcerted by this turn of events, she remained in Handel's company for a further two seasons. Her final performance for him was a revival of Ariosti's Coriolano (March 1724), given for her benefit. In it she sang an English cantata to a text by Pope containing the lines \\"But let old charmers yield to new; /Happy soil, adieu, adieu!\\". Second period in England Handel brought Durastanti back to England for his 1733‚Äì34 season, when she sang in revivals of Ottone and Il pastor fido, as well as several pasticcios. By this time she was probably in her fifties, and had been singing professionally for over thirty years. It is testimony to her enduring abilities that an aristocratic opera-lover of the time, Lady Bristol, was moved to comment: Although there is little surviving contemporary opinion of Durastanti's singing, Charles Burney wrote insightfully, though at second hand, of her performance in the first revival of Handel's Floridante in 1722: References Winton Dean: \\"Durastanti, Margherita\\", Grove Music Online ed L.

DIRECT was advocated by a group of space enthusiasts who asserted that they represented a broader team of dozens of NASA and space industry engineers who actively worked on the proposal on an anonymous, voluntary basis in their spare time. In September 2008, the DIRECT Team was said to consist of 69 members, 62 of whom were NASA engineers, NASA- contractor engineers, and managers from the Constellation Program. The small number of non-NASA members of the team publicly represented the group. The project name \\"DIRECT\\" referred to a philosophy of maximizing the re-use of hardware and facilities already in place for the Space Shuttle program (STS), hence a \\"direct\\" transition. The DIRECT Team asserted that using this approach to develop and operate a family of high-commonality rockets would reduce costs and the gap between retirement of the Space Shuttle and the first launch of Orion, shorten schedules, and simplify technical requirements for future US human space efforts. Three major versions of the DIRECT proposal were released with the last, Version 3.0, unveiled in May 2009. On 17 June 2009, the group presented its proposal at a public hearing of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, a panel reviewing US space efforts, in Washington D.C. With the October 11th signing of the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (S. 3729) by President Obama mandating work on the Space Launch System Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle, the DIRECT Team declared their effort a success and disbanded. Some members subsequently announced the formation of a new space technology company: C-Star Aerospace, LLC.NASA Has New Authorization but Future Remains Uncertain  SpaceNews.comhttp://www.launchcomplexmodels.org/Direct/documents/Direct-Team- Declares-Success-PR-101310.pdf  Jupiter launch vehicle family  Some envisioned Jupiter configurations, including crew and cargo variants DIRECT advocated developing a single, high-commonality family of rockets named Jupiter, adapted closely from existing Space Shuttle systems. Each Jupiter launch vehicle would use a \\"common core stage\\" consisting of a tank structure based closely on the existing Space Shuttle External Tank with a pair of standard four-segment Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) mounted at the sides as on the Space Shuttle. Up to four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) from the Space Shuttle Orbiter would be attached to the bottom of the External Tank. The engines would be deorbited along with the expended tank to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. Crews would be carried atop the launch vehicle in NASA's planned Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, itself topped by the planned Launch Abort System. Cargo, whether carried behind the Orion spacecraft or alone on a cargo-only launch would be enclosed by a payload fairing. Many configurations of Jupiter were seen as possible, but the DIRECT version 3.0 proposal, released in May 2009, recommended two: the Jupiter-130 and Jupiter-246, with claimed lift capacities exceeding 70 and 110 tonnes, respectively, to low Earth orbit.  Proposed and Possible Missions = Low Earth Orbit and Uncrewed Scientific Missions = Orion spacecraft taking a Space Shuttle Payload Delivery Module (SSPDM) to the ISS, carrying an airlock, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and other cargo on a single Jupiter-130. (Artist's conception) DIRECT asserted that the extra payload capability of the Jupiter-130 would allow for a range of additional cargo payloads to be flown with each Orion crew, a capability which is not possible with the Ares I. The team suggested a number of extra missions which would be enabled by Jupiter in their proposal, including: * New ISS resupply missions with the three ESA/ASI- built Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules * Performing more Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Missions with Orion crews * Launching massive new space telescopes over 8 meters in diameter (more than 3 times the diameter of Hubble) * Perform a Mars Sample Return mission on a single Jupiter launcher, to land on Mars and return a sample of its soil back to Earth for study as early as 2013 * Launching a human crew to fly around the moon as early as 2013 The DIRECT team asserted that these additional new missions could have been planned and funded due to development cost savings with the Jupiter rocket family compared to the current NASA baseline. They suggested that the proposed new missions and payloads could provide useful employment for many people who were working in the Space Shuttle program. = Lunar Mission Architecture = As with NASA's Constellation Program baseline, two launches would be performed for a DIRECT lunar mission. One Jupiter-246 rocket would carry the crew in NASA's planned Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle along with NASA's planned Lunar Surface Access Module lunar lander. Another Jupiter-246 would be launched, its Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS) fully fueled with no payload. This particular JUS would serve as the Earth Departure Stage. The two upper stages would meet in low Earth orbit and the lunar spacecraft would transfer from the spent JUS to the fresh JUS. The assembled Orion/Altair/JUS would leave Earth orbit for the Moon. The spacecraft would enter lunar orbit, and the entire crew would descend to the Moon in the Altair while the Orion remained in lunar orbit. DIRECT calculated that the two Jupiter-246s will be able to send 80.7 t of mass through trans- lunar injection. This compared favorably with an Ares I / Ares V dual launch, as of September 2008, projected to be capable of 71.1 t.  Origins and history  1978 image of a Morton Thiokol-proposed In-Line Shuttle Derived launch vehicle. Note painted tank. DIRECT's Jupiter vehicle would have been an \\"in-line\\" Space Shuttle-derived launch vehicle. This broad category of Space Shuttle adaptations, postulated since before the first Shuttle launch, removes the winged Space Shuttle Orbiter, moves the liquid main engines to the bottom of the cryogenic tankage (typically proposed to be adapted from the Shuttle external tank), and relocates the payload to above the tankage. The first official study of the concept was conducted in 1986 by NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. It was promoted as one of the alternatives for launching uncrewed cargo and would have potentially allowed a restarted lunar program as well. There were, however, no funds available to NASA for building any new vehicles while the Space Shuttle program continued. The idea was shelved and NASA concentrated on fixing and operating the Space Shuttle instead. DIRECT's approach had a resemblance to that of the 1991 National Launch System effort. Proposed jointly by NASA and the Department of Defense as an alternative to the Titan IV, the design was based on the same solid rocket boosters and modified external tank, but instead of the reusable Space Shuttle main engine, specified four of the proposed disposable, less expensive Space Transportation Main Engines. The United States Congress did not appropriate funding for the development. A great deal of reference material exists in the public domain regarding NLS. NASA's Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) of 2005 included a similar design to the DIRECT proposal using three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME). Known as LV-24 in crew launch form, and LV-25 in cargo configuration, the idea was dismissed because it did not have sufficient performance for the proposed lunar program - however the concept was not considered using an Earth departure stage (EDS). DIRECT's re-exploration of the SDLV idea began in 2006 in frustration with the high cost and delays of Ares I and worries that any similar issues with the giant Ares V might put the whole Constellation Program in jeopardy. An additional goal was to maintain US ability to launch crews to space with as short a gap as possible after the planned retirement of Shuttle. = DIRECT v1.0 = According to the DIRECT team, the first version of the DIRECT proposal was the product of a three- month study produced by more than a dozen NASA engineers and managers working in their free time, and a small group of engineers and non-engineers outside NASA. DIRECT took the final ESAS recommendation of using the EDS during the ascent phase of the flight to gain additional launch performance on the Cargo LV, and applied this same methodology to the LV-24/25. The next change in DIRECT's development was in response to NASA dropping the Space Shuttle Main Engine on the Ares V design due to the high manufacturing cost of the SSME engines and the difficulty in producing the required number of units per year with existing manufacturing facilities. NASA specified five RS-68 engines as the core engines for Ares V. The DIRECT proposal specified that its core should include two RS-68 engines. Additional performance for carrying payloads to Low Earth Orbit would be provided by upgrading the main engines with Regenerative Cooling Nozzles to improve their efficiency. The v1.0 proposal was submitted on October 25, 2006 to NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, and a wide range of industry, political and advocacy groups involved in the Constellation program. =Criticism of v1.0= In late 2006, the head of the ESAS Study, Dr. Doug Stanley, declared that the DIRECT v1.0 proposal could not work as it relied on overly optimistic and speculative performance specifications for an upgraded RS-68 Regen engine. Stanley produced official specifications from Rocketdyne about the RS-68 Regen upgrades as evidence for his point. = DIRECT v2.0 = Expanded diagram of the DIRECT v2.0 Jupiter-232 configuration human-rated version of the existing RS-68 engine design. On May 10, 2007, a revised DIRECT proposal was released. To address criticism of relying on engine studies rather than working engines, DIRECT v2.0 specified human-rating the standard performance RS-68 as used on existing Delta IV launchers and for the upper stage chose the lower of two specifications of J-2X engine which Rocketdyne is currently developing for NASA's Ares launchers. DIRECT v2.0 introduced a scalable, modular family of Shuttle- derived launch vehicles, starting with the Jupiter-120 and Jupiter-232. According to the proposal, the single-stage Jupiter-120 could achieve low Earth orbit with two standard ablative RS-68 engines, while an extra RS-68 was required on the core stage of the heavier two-stage Jupiter-232. The Earth Departure Stage for Jupiter-232 now required two standard J-2X engines instead of one. The DIRECT team produced a 131-page DIRECT v2.0 exploration architecture study that was released on September 19, 2007 at the AIAA \\"Space 2007\\" Conference in Long Beach, California. According to the group, this paper was created within a nine-month study. The paper provided detail on how the launch vehicles would be one component of a wider-reaching architecture for enabling the US to maintain the International Space Station (ISS), fly lunar missions, and provide additional capabilities for the NASA human spaceflight program. These capabilities included missions to Mars, Lagrangian point staging architecture options, and mission architectures for visiting Near- Earth object destinations. =Criticism and Rebuttal of v2.0= In June 2008, David King, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center stated that NASA has considered DIRECT as well as many other rocket proposals, and that the Ares family was the right set of rockets for the mission. \\"DIRECT v2.0 falls significantly short of the lunar lander performance requirement for exploration missions as specifically outlined in Constellation Program ground rules. The concept also overshoots the requirements for early missions to the International Space Station in the coming decade. These shortcomings would necessitate rushed development of a more expensive launch system with too little capability in the long run, and would actually increase the gap between space shuttle retirement and development of a new vehicle. Even more importantly, the Ares approach offers a much greater margin of crew safety - paramount to every mission NASA puts into space.\\" In July 2008, following NASA statements of no special studies on DIRECT, the space agency released some internal studies conducted in 2006 and 2007. Nearly a year later, on 18 May 2009, the DIRECT team released a rebuttal to the charges raised by NASA, concluding that \\"significant flaws in the evaluation of DIRECT\\" rendered the October 2007 analysis useless. = DIRECT v3.0 = Expanded diagram of the DIRECT v3.0 Jupiter-130 configuration To save development time and costs, Direct v3.0 proposed to use \\"off the shelf\\" Space Shuttle Main Engines which were already human-rated. On 29 May 2009, DIRECT spokesperson Stephen Metschan gave a presentation to the 28th Annual International Space Development Conference in Orlando, Florida entitled, \\"Direct 3.0: Landing Twice the Mass on the Moon at Half the Cost.\\" In April 2009, following NASA trade studies comparing use of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) to the originally planned RS-68 engine for Ares V, the DIRECT Team announced that future DIRECT proposals would recommend SSME as the core-stage engine. The engine change was due to concerns that the ablatively-cooled RS-68 would not survive the intense heat produced by the nearby exhaust plumes of the Space Shuttle SRBs. DIRECT asserts that the higher cost of the regeneratively cooled SSME will be offset by the time and money saved by not human-rating the RS-68. Similarly, for the upper stage, the DIRECT Team recommended using six of the flight-proven RL10B-2 engine. In May 2009 the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee to be chaired by Norman R. Augustine. On 17 June 2009, team member Stephen Metschan presented the DIRECT v3.0 concept to the Committee, which was formed to offer independent advice to the incoming Obama Administration. The Committee's final report did not directly compare DIRECT to the Constellation Program, but did offer budget, schedule, and mission combinations where a shuttle-derived launch vehicle could be used. On 19 January 2010, amid rumors that NASA would propose a DIRECT-like inline launch vehicle, the DIRECT team made a presentation to NASA Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, Douglas Cooke, and NASA Associate Administrator for Space Operations, William H. Gerstenmaier, in a meeting convened by NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, Jr. Integrated Approach - reuse existing facilities Pegasus barge delivers a Space Shuttle External Tank to the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center in Florida from the Michoud Assembly Facility in Louisiana. DIRECT would use the existing barge to transport its planned similar tank from Michoud. According to the DIRECT team, many NASA engineers and managers supported the concept and completed a cost analysis comparison with NASA's current Constellation program and a detailed series of evaluations for supporting facilities such as data on the existing manufacturing facilities for the External Tank at the Michoud Assembly Facility and the various launch-processing facilities currently at the Kennedy Space Center. DIRECT proposed to re-use nearly all of the existing facilities with minimal modifications in contrast to the Ares I and Ares V rockets which would have required extensive modifications and replacements over existing facilities. The DIRECT's core stage would have remained at the existing diameter of the Shuttle's External Tank compared to for Ares V. The DIRECT team claimed that by not increasing the core stage diameter the existing External Tank manufacturing tooling at the Michoud Assembly Facility, the existing Pegasus barge used to transport the tank from Michoud to Kennedy Space Center, the existing work platforms in the Vehicle Assembly Building, the existing Mobile Launcher Platforms and Crawler-Transporters, and parts of the structure of the existing Fixed Service Structure and Flame Trenches at Launch Complex 39 could be used without major modifications. The Space Launch System, NASA's eventual successor to Ares, retained the Space Shuttle tankage diameter of . Ares I/Ares V Cost and Schedule vs. DIRECT =Ares I/V Costs= One of the strongest programmatic criticisms with the Ares I and Ares V architecture was the high cost for both developing two new launchers and for operating two concurrent programs. The cost concerns were cited in GAO Reports to Congress noting that the Ares I alone was expected to cost up to $14.4 billion to develop. Former NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin confirmed that the total cost for developing both Ares launchers would be $32 billion, indicating that the Ares V would be more expensive to develop than the Ares I. =Ares I Schedule= The schedule for Ares I incurred several delays since the inception of the new lunar program. The original intent in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) Report was to have a crewed flight as early as mid-2011 after the Space Shuttle retirement in 2010. A subsequent official NASA schedule had a 65% confidence that the first crewed flight of Ares I with Orion (Orion 2) would occur in March 2015. A critical activity of Ares I development was the schedule for the J-2X upper stage engine and the five- segment version of the SRB. Engineers were concerned about thrust oscillation and Orion-Ares I integration. In 2008, Lockheed Martin requested that NASA redesign Ares I in order to end integration risks with the Orion crew capsule. The combined test results from the Ares I-X launch and the Ares I static test firing indicated that thrust oscillation was not a critical issue, according to program engineers. =DIRECT self comparison to Ares= DIRECT contended that the requirement to develop 5-segment SRBs and the J-2X upper stage engine for Ares I in order to fly the first Orion was directly responsible for the delays in schedule and the comparatively high development costs. All-new manufacturing at the Michoud Assembly Facility and launch facilities at Kennedy Space Center would also be required for Ares I. In contrast, DIRECT proposed to reuse the existing 4-segment fully human rated Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster and Space Shuttle Main Engine. DIRECT also proposed reuse of existing manufacturing to build a modified variant of the existing Space Shuttle External Tank. Only moderate modifications would be required at Kennedy Space Center to enable launches. DIRECT's proposal for a single launch vehicle were intended to remove the program risks associated with the possible cancellation of the Ares V launcher due to budgetary constraints. DIRECT asserted its Jupiter launchers would avoid the delays of Ares I by not requiring the J-2X on the first-generation Jupiter-130 vehicle, by not requiring the five-segment SRB and by providing more than 60 t of lift performance that would ameliorate weight issues on the Orion design. DIRECT also claimed that money would be saved by avoiding a parallel development of the Ares V booster, since the Jupiter family would represent a single rocket family program. The group suggested that the money saved on Ares V be reused to speed development work of such other elements as the Orion, the Jupiter-130, launch facility modifications and all associated systems. A significant cash injection was expected to allow the schedules of all those elements to be trimmed substantially, allowing full operational capability of an Orion/Jupiter-130 system to perform 6-person crew rotations and cargo deliveries to the ISS by 2013. =Cost Savings and Crewed Spaceflight Gap= Proponents asserted that the DIRECT proposal would enable NASA to fulfill the mandate of the Vision for Space Exploration sooner and more safely than the planned Ares I and Ares V, at a lower cost and with less programmatic risk due to a simpler approach which decreases new development efforts. Advocates said the DIRECT proposal would allow NASA to provide sufficient money to continue funding programs beyond launch vehicle development and operation, including extending its participation in the International Space Station, which was scheduled to end in 2016 as of 2009. The DIRECT proposal also suggested that NASA could use costs savings from the DIRECT proposal to accelerate the VSE's schedule for returning to the Moon and to potentially fly other missions such as servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope. In contrast to these claims, NASA senior manager for the STS program, John Shannon stated that he thought the DIRECT proposal underestimated the costs for the Jupiter rocket family. =Orbital Assembly Steps= The DIRECT proposal required more orbital assembly steps than the proposed Constellation Program. In Constellation, after Low Earth Orbital rendezvous of Ares I and Ares V, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (approximately 22 t ) from the Ares I would invert and dock with the Altair lunar lander (approximately 44 t ) which would still be attached to the Ares V Earth Departure Stage. In the case of DIRECT, the combined mass of Orion and Altair would exceed the carrying capacity of the Jupiter-130. If a Jupiter-130 were launched with Orion and a Jupiter-246 launched with Altair, the Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS) with Altair would have insufficient propellant to push Altair/Orion beyond Earth orbit. Thus, the DIRECT baseline was to launch two Jupiter-246s, one with a partially fueled (75 t) JUS carrying Orion/Altair and the other with only a fully fueled (175 t) JUS. After orbital rendezvous, the Orion would invert and re-dock with Altair much like in the Apollo Program and Constellation Program. However, with DIRECT, the crew in Orion would have to separate Orion/Altair from the first JUS and dock Altair to the second JUS. The second JUS would have enough remaining propellant to serve as the Earth Departure Stage. The first JUS would be discarded in Low Earth Orbit, while the second would be discarded after its Earth departure burn. =Jupiter Upper Stage Mass= The Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS) mass to propellant capacity has been regarded as realistic. Minimal upper stage mass is desirable so that the stage may propel the Orion and Altair spacecraft out of Earth orbit, but the JUS would need to be large enough to carry enough propellant to both achieve low Earth Orbit and to serve as the Earth departure stage. The DIRECT v3.0 JUS had a putative mass of 11.3 t for a propellant capacity of 175.5 t. While claiming a design heritage from the Centaur series of upper stages, DIRECT specifically cited new materials, new welding techniques, and a common bulkhead separating the Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen tanks as sufficient to account for the low stage mass. Bernard Kutter of United Launch Alliance described the even more radical DIRECT v2.0 JUS design as, \\"...very reasonable. I‚Äôd even call it conservative.\\" =Payload Capacity= The payload capacity of Ares V to low earth orbit, according to NASA, would have been 188,000 kg. This was more than the largest proposed Jupiter rocket (Jupiter-246 Heavy with 5 segment SRBS) which was claimed to lift about 120,000 kg to LEO.http://www.directlauncher.org/documents/Baseball_Cards/J246H-41.5004.08001_EDS_090608.jpg For potential Mars missions more launches per mission would thus be required using Jupiter instead of Ares V and the mission modules would need to be separated in more different parts. However, NASA's Design Reference Mission 5.0 completed in 2007 required only a 125mt+ launch vehicle with a 10m+ diameter shroud for a Mars mission with 6 separate Ares V launches. The Jupiter rocket would fulfill the requirements of the Design Reference Mission with only a very narrow shortfall in payload to LEO, while fulfilling the volume requirements. The Jupiter rockets would be shorter in height than the Ares V, permitting very long payload fairings and thus greater total internal volume than possible with the taller Ares V, which would quickly encounter restraints due to height limitations within the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center.

The term \\"world riddle\\" concerns the nature of the universe and the meaning of life. The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or allegorical meaning within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of Also sprach Zarathustra (1896) by composer Richard Strauss. \\"Colorado Symphony Orchestra - Richard Strauss (1864-1949): Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" (program notes), Charley Samson, Colorado Symphony Orchestra, 2004, webpage: CSO-AlsoSprach. \\"Classic Records Catalog / LSC-1806: Liner Notes\\" (description), Chicago Symphony Orchestra, R.

Friedrich Nietzsche referred to the \\"World Riddle\\" (Weltr√§thsel) in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.  View of Haeckel  Ernst Haeckel viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, \\"What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?\\" which he explained, in a lecture in 1892, would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system: Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as \\"mechanical work of the ganglion-cells\\" as stated.  View of William James  The philosopher and psychologist William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone. In his book Pragmatism (1907) he satirized the world-riddle as follows:  Emil du Bois-Reymond  Emil du Bois-Reymond used the term \\"World Riddle\\" in 1880 for seven great questions of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In a lecture to the Berlin Academy of Sciences he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.

His music has been played by many national and international performers and ensembles including the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Martyn Brabbins and Grant Llewellyn and the English Northern Philharmonia under Paul Daniel, and is mainly performed abroad from Mexico to Russia among other places and artists. He was a visiting Composition Lecturer at the Birmingham Conservatoire (BCU) until early 2014. Biography Glover was born in Birmingham, UK. He studied in Nottingham and gained his Doctorate in 1994 from Keele University after studying with George Nicholson . His composition is influenced by world music and rock. He has won several competitions. His best-known work is the aggressive work for orchestra \\"Fractured Vistas\\" from 1995. Played and broadcast in various countries and shortlisted in the Lutoslawski Prize in 1997. In 2000 he began working on his concerto The Death of Angels: A Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, based on John Milton's Paradise Lost. This work was premiered and broadcast by the BBC in February 2003. His 45-minute Piano Concerto took four years to compose between 2002 and 2006 but remains unperformed to date but he has always stated that he feels it is his best work. After three years research, experimentation with Sound Files and electronic principles and historic research into the Eastern Roman Empire he completed his \\"Symphony No.2: Byzantium\\" in 2009 which was released on the CDP label in Britain. Further research and experimentation produced the \\"Anglo Saxon Trilogy\\" based on Anglo Saxon culture and language. Both works are for fixed media (CD). In April 2013 a 50th birthday concert at the Birmingham Conservatoire of Music showcased some of his more recent chamber music to great critical praise.  Musical style  Glover worked as a semi-professional flautist as a student and much of his output features the flute, with several commissioned compositions for the Japanese/Mexican flutist Asako Arai. Much of Glover's early work dealt with the manipulation of pulse and time. He said in an interview on BBC Radio in 2004 that his fascination in this area came from watching nature's natural rhythms of life change and move at different rates of change, and \\"the sound of the great earth cracking‚Ä¶\\". This informed the works in his PhD thesis and culminated in works such as Fractured Vistas and The Fickle Virgin of Seventeen Summers. This research work lead to his study of the polyrhythmic, micro-macro aleatory works of Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and Witold Lutos≈Çawski. His own work is something of a development of these ideas into a more modern idiom, this is particularly evident in the slow movements of his Violin and Flute Concertos.  Alleged political stance  In November 2008 a database with names of British National Party members was made public by Wikileaks, with Dr Andrew Glover's name, address, phone number, email address and a short biography appearing on the list. Subsequently, in the Daily Mirror, Alun Palmer quoted Glover as saying \\"I am not particularly open about my involvement in the BNP because people choose to presume we are racists.\\" The then Deputy Chairman of the BNP, Simon Darby, said the source of the leak could be a disgruntled ex-member. Thereupon, in March 2009, a petition launched by Rose Mitchell (a second-year student), Love Music Hate Racism and Unite Against Fascism sought to have Glover removed from his post as visiting lecturer at Birmingham City University due to his alleged membership. Mitchell said she had been shocked by allegations that Glover was a BNP member. \\"He teaches students from all over the world. I don't have any evidence that he has behaved in a racist way towards students,\\" she said, adding that the allegation that he was involved in a far-Right party was \\"very worrying\\". The effort failed. Simon Darby said \\"He [Glover] is merely a member, or an alleged member, of the BNP and is being driven from his job as a result\\". The BNP advised those named on the list to deny their membership and said that they would confirm that in writing if required. In a Times Higher Education Supplement interview Glover denied being a current member of the BNP and accused the left wing of a \\"1950s McCarthy witch-hunt\\" against him.

The cloning vector is limited, as a host (usually E. coli) can only contain one fosmid molecule. Fosmids can hold DNA inserts of up to 40 kb in size; often the source of the insert is random genomic DNA. A fosmid library is prepared by extracting the genomic DNA from the target organism and cloning it into the fosmid vector. The ligation mix is then packaged into phage particles and the DNA is transfected into the bacterial host. Bacterial clones propagate the fosmid library. The low copy number offers higher stability than vectors with relatively higher copy numbers, including cosmids. Fosmids may be useful for constructing stable libraries from complex genomes. Fosmids have high structural stability and have been found to maintain human DNA effectively even after 100 generations of bacterial growth. Fosmid clones were used to help assess the accuracy of the Public Human Genome Sequence. Discovery The fertility plasmid or F-plasmid was discovered by Esther Lederberg and encodes information for the biosynthesis of sex pilus to aid in bacterial conjugation. Conjugation involves using the sex pilus to form a bridge between two bacteria cells; the bridge allows the F+ cell to transfer a single- stranded copy of the plasmid so that both cells contain a copy of the plasmid. On the way into the recipient cell, the corresponding DNA strand is synthesized by the recipient. The donor cell maintains a functional copy of the plasmid. It later was discovered that the F factor was the first episome and can exist as an independent plasmid making it a very stable vector for cloning. Conjugation aids in the formation of bacterial clone libraries by ensuring all cells contain the desired fosmid. Fosmids are DNA vectors that use the F-plasmid origin of replication and partitioning mechanisms to allow cloning of large DNA fragments. A library that provides 20‚Äì70-fold redundant coverage of the genome can easily be prepared.\\\\ DNA libraries The first step in sequencing entire genomes is cloning the genome into manageable units of some 50-200 kilobases in length. It is ideal to use a fosmid library because of its stability and limitation of one plasmid per cell. By limiting the number of plasmids in the cells the potential for recombination is decreased, thus preserving the genome insert.Gibson, Greg. Muse, Spencer. \\"A Primer of Genome Science\\". Third edition. Sinauer Associates p.84-85 Fosmids contain several functional elements: *OriT (Origin of Transfer): The sequence which marks the starting point of conjugative transfer. *OriV (Origin of Replication): The sequence starting with which the plasmid-DNA will be replicated in the recipient cell. *tra-region (transfer genes): Genes coding the F-Pilus and DNA transfer process. *IS (Insertion Elements): so-called \\"selfish genes\\" (sequence fragments which can integrate copies of themselves at different locations). The methods of cutting and inserting DNA into fosmid vectors have been perfected. There are now many companies that can create a fosmid library from any sample of DNA in a very short period of time at a relatively low cost. This has been vital in allowing researchers to sequence numerous genomes for study. Through a variety of methods, more than 6651 organisms genomes have been fully sequenced, with 58,695 ongoing. Uses Sometimes it is difficult to accurately distinguish individual chromosomes based on chromosome length, arm ratio, and C-banding pattern. Fosmids can be used as reliable cytological markers for individual chromosome identification and fluorescent in situ hybridization based metaphase chromosome karyotypes can be used to show whether the positions of these fosmids were successfully constructed.Liu, C 2010 Karyotyping in Melon (Cucumis melo L.) by Cross- Species Fosmid Fluorescence in situ Hybridization, CYTOGENETIC AND GENOME RESEARCH The fosmid system is excellent for rapidly creating chromosome- specific mini-BAC libraries from flow-sorted chromosomal DNA. The major advantage of Fosmids over other cosmid systems lies in its capability of stably propagating human DNA fragments. Highly repetitive in nature, human DNA is well known for its extreme instability in multicopy vector systems. It has been found that the stability increases dramatically when the human DNA inserts are present in single copies in recombination deficient E. coli cells. Therefore, Fosmids serve as reliable substrates for large scale genomic DNA sequencing.

Named after the geologist Charles Lapworth, the origins of the Museum date to 1880, and it reopened in 2016 following a ¬£2.7 million redevelopment project that created new galleries and displays, as well as new visitor and educational facilities. The Lapworth Museum is free to visit, and its galleries are aimed at a broad range of audiences, from families and children to undergraduate students and specialist geology groups. The galleries use the Lapworth's collections to tell the story of the evolution of life and the planet over 4.5 billion years of Earth history, with a particular focus on how the environment, climate, plants and animals of the English Midlands have changed over time. The Lapworth's collection includes more than 250,000 specimens of fossils, rocks and minerals that are of international scientific significance, as well as an important archive that documents key scientific discoveries and important historical geologists. The Lapworth was one of five UK museums shortlisted for Art Fund Museum of the Year 2017.  Exhibition and visitor facilities  left The Lapworth Museum contains three public galleries. The main hall of the Lapworth Museum forms the Evolution of Life gallery, and contains replica skeletons of the carnivorous dinosaur Allosaurus and the flying reptile Pteranodon, as well as a floor-to-ceiling rock wall showing the major rock types and explaining the rock cycle. The gallery uses the Lapworth's fossil collections to tell the story of life from the Precambrian to the present day. Animated reconstructions show the changing local environment of the Midlands at key points in Earth history, including tropical reefs in the Silurian Period, swampy rainforests in the Carboniferous Period, shallow oceans in the Jurassic Period, and ice age tundra during the Quaternary Period. The gallery also contains displays on modern biodiversity, human evolution, and the life and work of Charles Lapworth. Active Earth gallery of the Lapworth Museum of Geology. The gallery explores Earth processes such as climate change, earthquakes and volcanoes. The Active Earth gallery explains Earth processes, including earthquakes, volcanoes, climate change and the formation of mountains. An interactive globe projector allows visitors to view datasets such as the changing positions of the continents through geological time. The Mineral Wealth gallery explores the diversity, excavation, classification and uses of minerals, and includes information on important local historical figures such as William Murdoch and Matthew Boulton, as well as gemstones and the Jewelry Quarter of Birmingham. There is also a display of fluorescent minerals that can be viewed under ultraviolet light. Visitor facilities include a manned reception desk, a small shop and cafe, and toilets. All galleries are fully accessible. There is a dedicated education room for the delivery of educational sessions, and a small temporary exhibition space featuring changing displays. The collections and archive are accessible to academic researchers and the public on request. The Lapworth also has an extensive volunteer programme.

The Lapworth Museum is based in one of the wings of this historic building. Charles Lapworth, first Professor of Geology at the University of Birmingham, after whom the Lapworth Museum is named. The Lapworth Museum is located within one of the wings of the Grade II* listed Aston Webb Building on the main campus of the University of Birmingham. The Aston Webb Building was designed by the architects Sir Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, and it retains many of its original Edwardian features. The Lapworth has occupied its current space from the 1920s, but the history of the Museum dates back to 1880 and the foundation of Mason College, the forerunner of the University of Birmingham. The Museum is named after Professor Charles Lapworth, an English geologist who was the first Professor of Geology at the University, and a key figure in 19th century geological science. The Lapworth collections have long provided a teaching aid for the University of Birmingham's geology students, and are the subject of active research by palaeontologists, geologists, archaeologists and historians from the University of Birmingham and internationally. = Redevelopment project = Lapworth Museum of Geology in 2014, prior to the redevelopment of the Museum. The Lapworth Museum closed to visitors in December 2014 for a ¬£2.7m redevelopment project. The aims of this project were to completely redevelop and expand the galleries and displays, making them more accessible and appealing to a broader, non-academic audience, add key visitor and educational facilities that were previously missing (e.g. Education Room, reception desk, shop, cafe, toilets), make all Museum spaces fully accessible, and upgrade the Museum collections storage facilities. Funding for the redevelopment came from a major Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£1.693m, as well as from University of Birmingham alumni through the Circles of Influence campaign, and grants from Arts Council England and DCMS Wolfson. The redevelopment project was delivered by Lapworth Museum and University of Birmingham staff and volunteers, in collaboration with external partners including Associated Architects, Real Studios (exhibition design), The Hub (exhibition fit-out) and Squint/Opera (AV design). The Museum was reopened in June 2016 by Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel Prize winner and former President of the Royal Society, Professor David Eastwood, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Birmingham, and Professor Alice Roberts, the University's Professor of Public Understanding of Science.  Collections and archive  The Museum collection contains over 250,000 specimens of fossils, rocks and minerals, as well as geological maps, equipment, models, and photographic material, and also zoological specimens and stone axes. Also housed in the Museum is the Lapworth Archive, a detailed and extensive archive of Charles Lapworth's work that represents one of the most complete archives of any 19th century geologist, as well as important archives relating to other significant 19th and 20th century geologists such as Professor L. J. Wills and Professor Fred Shotton. Archival material also documents the time spent at the University of Birmingham by the Chinese geologist Li Siguang, as well as the work of pioneering female scientists such as Dame Maria Ogilvie Gordon and Dame Ethel Shakespear. In 2008 the entire collection of the Lapworth was officially designated as of outstanding national and international importance by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and subsequently by Arts Council England. The Lapworth is also accredited by Arts Council England. The significance of the Lapworth's collections to the scientific community is recognised by funding through the HEFCE Museums, Galleries and Collections Fund. In 2009, the Earth Science collection of the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery was relocated to the Lapworth Museum as a long term loan. = Palaeontology (fossil) collections = The strengths of the palaeontological collections reflect the geology of the local region, as well as the research interests of past and present University of Birmingham palaeontologists. One of the most important collections is of Silurian marine animals from the 428 million-year-old Wenlock Limestone of the Dudley area. The limestone records animals living in and around ocean floor reefs when the Midlands was covered by warm, shallow tropical seas. Fossils were primarily collected during the 18th and 19th century during quarrying of the limestone for use as flux during the production of iron. Key collections made in the 19th century by Charles Ketley and Sir Charles Holcroft were acquired by the Lapworth. The Lapworth also includes an important collection of graptolites, marine colonial organisms that are highly important for correlating and dating rocks, as a result of the work of Charles Lapworth, who was a leading expert on the group. Other key collections include: plants and animals from the Coal Measures of the South Staffordshire Coalfield, particularly those preserved in exceptional in ironstone nodules from Coseley; ice age mammals such as mammoth and cave bear; exceptionally preserved fish fossils from Brazil, Italy, Lebanon and the USA; and specimens from famous international fossiliferous deposits such as the Solnhofen Limestone of southern Germany and the Burgess Shale of British Columbia. Specimen of the extinct trigonotarbid Eophrynus prestvicii held at the museum (A ‚Äì dorsal view, B ‚Äì ventral view) = Mineralogy collections = The Lapworth collections include around 12,000 minerals collected worldwide, but with particularly fine examples from the British mining areas of Cornwall, Cumbria, Shropshire and Wanlockhead. The specimens include many from collections dating back to the eighteenth and nineteenth century, an from mines long since closed. A particularly important collection is that of William Murdoch, an engineer and inventor who worked at Soho House with James Watt and Matthew Boulton.  Events and educational activities  Following the redevelopment project, the Lapworth launched a new education programme including workshops aimed at a range of key stages, all of which have been developed to link to the National Curriculum. The Lapworth is used by schools, colleges, home education groups, university and adult education groups as a teaching aid. Talks, hands on sessions and \\"behind the scenes\\" tours can be arranged for visiting groups wishing to learn more about natural history. A new annual public lecture was established following the redevelopment of the Lapworth. The Keith Palmer Lecture Series, named after the lead individual donor to the redevelopment, was established to promote the public understanding of natural science by a distinguished invited speaker. The lectures are aimed at the non-academic community of the local region. The first Keith Palmer lecture in 2017 was given by Professor Kenneth Lacovara. The Lapworth also organises a series of public talks, the 'Lapworth Lectures', by leading geologists and palaeontologists every other Monday, at 5pm, during term time. A full list of guest speakers and dates is provided on the Museum's website. The Lapworth runs a variety of family activities at the University of Birmingham's annual community festival each year. Details of the community festival and planned activities are provided on the University of Birmingham website. The Lapworth also participates in other regular University of Birmingham events, such as the annual Arts & Science Festival. Temporary exhibitions are organised several times a year within the Lapworth's temporary exhibition space.  Opening hours  Monday - Friday 10.00 to 17.00 Saturday & Sunday 12.00 to 17.00 Bank holiday opening times are available on the Museum's website.

It lies 17 km west of the city of Granada. Its population was recorded in 2005 as 4,590. The principal crops are asparagus, olives and apples. The village is famous as the birthplace of the poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. His birthplace is now a museum, the Museo Casa Natal Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. The municipality includes the population centers of Fuente Vaqueros, La Paz, and a small part of Pedro Ruiz, located between the municipal border of Fuente Vaqueros and Santa Fe. In addition there was the village of El Martinete, an old flour mill of which only its ruins are preserved. In this town was born the most important Spanish poet of the 20th century: Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, whose figure is the main tourist and cultural claim of the town.  History  Fuente Vaqueros shares history with the rest of the places of the Vega of Granada. Of probably Arab origin, it lived the splendor of the Nazar√≠ Dynasty, until the Reconquista in 1492. It also suffered, like the other towns of the zone, the expulsion of the Moriscos and its later repopulation with settlers of other regions. El Soto de Roma, owned by the Kings of Granada, became part of the crown royal estate after the war of Granada, as a hunting and recreation site, with dense forests and plantations. For three hundred years he was in royal hands, giving his Majesty King Carlos III to Ricardo Wall in 1756. In 1767 began the colonization of the estate. In 1777 he returned to the Crown, passing then to Manuel Godoy. Upon returning to the Crown, in 1813 the Cortes donated the estate in perpetuity to the Duke of Wellington as a reward for the services rendered during the War of Independence against the French. In the center of this enormous estate there was an area where a lot of water accumulated, becoming a swamp sometimes due to the losses of the aquifer of la vega, there were two farms: Alquer√≠a de la Fuente and Alquer√≠a de los Vaqueros, which later would lead to Fuente Vaqueros. Until 1940 the present municipality of Fuente Vaqueros belonged to the Duke of Wellington, having its land leased to the settlers and little by little it was sold to them, that populated and gave way to the present municipality.  Culture   Cristo de la Victoria  During the War of Independence (1808‚Äì1812), in a village called Darajali, the grandparents of a neighbor of the village, better known as Enanilla de Rute, lived as landlords. One night four men knocked at the door, not knowing if they were Spanish or French, asking for wood in exchange for something they had hidden: a Christ with his cross and life size. The landlord gave them firewood and stayed with the Christ, but the house was very small and they had no place to have it, so they took it to the grain store in the village called El Tr√©bol. The Christ spent a few weeks there, until French officers arrived in the village, occupying the wheat store. The mayor of the village, who was called Don Vidal, and his wife, Dona Vicenta, ordered the landlords who took the Christ to the store to feed the French. The officers, seeing the Christ, wanted to burn him for warmth, but the mayor avoided it, offering them firewood. The mayor Don Vidal took the Christ to his house, hiding it under the bed, where the people of the town visited him and gave him the name of Se√±or del t√≠o Vidalico. When Don Vidal died, his sons donated the Christ to the village church, with the name of the Holy Christ of Victory, a name that comes from the victory of Spain to the French. The day of the Christ was the 3 of September, in the Feria Real del Ganado (days 1, 2, 3 and 4 of that month), but the parish priest of the Church, Don Eduardo Mart√≠n Granados, being the fair a pagan festival traveled to Rome (Italy), in order to register him as a patron saint of Fuente Vaqueros, and changed his day, which since the 50s became the 14th of September, the day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.  Gastronomy  The vegetables that are grown in the fertile lands of Fuente Vaqueros are the traditional dishes of the municipality. In fact, its main irrigation crop is green asparagus - which together with potatoes, spinach and peppers - is a regular component of its recipe. As dishes of vegetables stand out the leche pava, which does not carry milk but gourd, the maimones soup and the patatas en gloria, with oil and vinegar. As for the meats, stand out preparations as the collejas en ajillos, cuchifritos and the pig and its derivatives, that are cooked in the typical slaughters. The huevos a la nieve is a typical dessert, along with the wine rolls. The fruit trees, such as apple trees, plums, persimmons and pear trees that line the fields of Fuente Vaqueros, put the dessert to their menus.  External links  * P√°gina web del Excmo.

Health problem Jarrar has suffered from bouts of deep vein thrombosis, and her lawyer has expressed concern that appropriate medical care for her condition might not be available in an Israeli prison.'Lawyer: Israel to detain Palestinian MP for six months,' Al Jazeera 6 April 2015. In July 2010, Jarrar was informed by a doctor that tests indicated she needed an urgent brain scan to establish an exact neurological diagnosis. Since the medical equipment to make the diagnosis was not available in the West Bank, where she was then detained, she was informed that the PNA's Health Ministry would cover the costs of her hospitalization in Amman, but not in Israel. As a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, expatriation for medical tests should, she was assured, could be arranged. An Israeli official for the Civil Administration of the West Bank, said there was no security threat were she to be treated in Jordan. On August 29, she was denied transit to Jordan via the Allenby Bridge, and Shin Bet stated that she was a security threat to the region. Former European Parliament vice president Luisa Morgantini called on the European Parliament to intervene by requesting that Israel allow Jarrar to go to Amman for the necessary medical treatment.'EU official: Israel denying lawmaker access to hospital,' Ma'an News Agency 20 September 2010.

Expulsion order On 20 August 2014, approximately 50 Israeli soldiers surrounded Jarrar's home in Ramallah, and an Israeli officer gave her an expulsion order stating she was a threat to the security of the region and was to leave her home of residence, Ramallah, and transfer to the district of Jericho where she was to live under a restricted movement protocol for six months. The order was to be considered immediately effective. She rejected the order, stating: \\"it is the occupation who must leave our homeland.\\" Ramallah, according to the Oslo Accords, is located in Area A, and under complete Palestinian jurisdiction. Jarrar refused to sign the order.'Urgent Appeal: Palestinian Legislative Council Member Khalida Jarrar Expelled to Jericho,' Addameer org. 20 August 2014.

But Jarrar actually never left Ramallah. According to a left-wing columnist of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, her refusal to be deported lead to her arrest in April 2015. Administrative detention and trial On 2 April 2015, at around 1:15 a.m., Jarrar was arrested at her home by Israeli soldiers.

No reason was given him for the arrest, though a commander, a Captain Yihye, said she had flouted an earlier army order to leave her home. Soldiers tried to prevent the husband and wife from embracing as she left, but Yihye intervened to allow them to do so. One of their daughters was found by her father bound by plastic handcuffs, after Khalida was taken away. According to the arrest warrant, she was involved in 'incitement and involvement in terror.' She was incarcerated in HaSharon prison.Gideon Levy, Alex Levac, 'My wife, the jailed Palestinian MP', Haaretz 24 April 2015. Two computers and a mobile phone were confiscated. A six-month administrative detention, which can be renewed indefinitely, was issued against her by Central Command Chief Gen. Roni Numa and was reviewed by a military court on April 8,'PA lawmaker sent to six months in jail without trial,' The Times of Israel, 6 April 2015 where it was confirmed, despite international protests. Her detention without trial was condemned by Israel's Haaretz newspaper, which claimed Israel at times adopts the procedure excessively.Haaretz Editorial, 'Israel is punishing Palestinian activist through vindictive administrative detention,', Haaretz, 7 April 2015:'International conventions do not prohibit administrative detentions, but restrict their use to extremely irregular cases, due to the harsh infringement of civil and prisoners‚Äô rights involved.

Israel's Palestinian Arab MPS, including Ahmad Tibi, called for her immediate release and Aida Touma-Suleiman called it 'a political detention of an elected official who is opposed to the occupation.'Jack Khoury, 'Israeli Arab MKs call for release of Palestinian lawmaker arrested by Israel,' Haaretz 8 April 2015. A Palestinian prisoner advocate who tracks the welfare of Palestinian prisoners, Kaddoura Fares, said the timing of the arrest aroused suspicions that Israel's measure against Jarrar was motivated by vindictiveness, given her role in monitoring International Criminal Court (ICC) procedures, and the fact that the order for her detention was implemented immediately after the Palestinian National Authority was accepted as a member of the ICC and was arrested just after the Palestinian Authority joined the ICC. Her husband also stated it may be a possible retaliation for Palestine's membership of the ICC. Amnesty International noted that Jarrar suffers from chronic health problems, with the prospect of facing indefinite detention without charge or trial.'Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories: Parliamentarian detained without charge: Khalida Jarrar,' Amnesty International 7 April 2015. 58 Members of the European Parliament protested her arrest in an open letter to Federica Mogherini, stating that attempts to forcibly transfer a person under occupation, to which she was subject in August 2014, constituted a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Haaretz stated at the time of her arrest: > 'If Jarrar broke the law, Israel must put her on trial and prove she > committed a crime. If, on the other hand, the reason for her detention is > revenge, she must be released immediately.' Her administrative detention led to formal imprisonment pending a trial, which began with a closed session on April 15, at a military criminal court at Ofer Prison where the prosecutor at the Israeli military court laid 12 charges against her, based on her association with the PFLP, including membership of an organization Israel classifies as illegal; participation in protests, and incitement to kidnap Israeli soldiers.'Israeli court brings 12 charges against MP Khalida Jerrar', Ma'an News Agency 18 April 2015.'Until the charges against her on Wednesday, Jerrar had been held in Israeli prisons under administrative detention.' Several counts refer to her having given interviews, speeches and lectures, participating in marches and a politicized book fair, calling for Palestinian prisoners to be released, and opposing the Israeli occupation. The indictment also spoke of suspicions she had visited the homes of prisoners‚Äô families, and of having attended a book fair, of calling for the release of Ahmad Saadat, a leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.Gideon Levy, Alex Levac, 'Palestinian lawmaker Khalida Jarrar has been incarcerated in an Israeli jail without a trial for 20 months. Another period of ‚Äòadministrative detention‚Äô will soon expire. Will she come home?,' Haaretz 15 February 2019. Haaretz has called the trials \\"a Kafkaesque perversion of military law\\". According to Addameer, the presiding judge confirmed the administrative detention order, which means she cannot be released on bail.'PLC Member Khalida Jarrar indicted but continues to be detained under administrative detention' , Addameer 15 April 2015. A date of 29 April was set for a judicial review of the charges, in a hearing that will determine if she is to be detained on remand until the end of her trial. If it is decided that she will be remanded, the administrative detention order will be cancelled. If she is not remanded, the order for her administrative detention will be reviewed on 6 May 2015. On April 26, a Haaretz editorial argued that the Military Advocate General had decided to press terrorist charges against her only after her arbitrary detention aroused international criticism and that a suspicion exists was that the trial was payback for her involvement in Palestine's successful entry into the ICC. The Editorial noted that the arrest of a democratically elected official in violation of her parliamentary immunity, by Israeli forces inside territory under full Palestinian jurisdiction had been generally ignored by the Israeli media, had stirred almost no protests by women's groups on behalf of a female activist, and no significant move by her counterparts in the Israeli Knesset.Haaretz Editorial, 'Israel must free Palestinian MP Khalida Jarrar', Haaretz, 26 April 26, 2015. She was the only female detained under Israel's administrative detention policy, and joined a further 16 Palestinian lawmakers already imprisoned without trial under the same administrative detention measure, along with 450 administrative detainees held in prison with no legal process, 319 of which have been served with administrative detention orders in the first 4 months of 2015, six times higher than the number for the preceding year, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Centre for Studies. Palestinian parliament member Khalida Jarrar with MK Ayman Odeh Head of the Joint List after the Israeli authorities released her On 21 May 2015 the court ruled Jarrar was to be released to house arrest. She was also fined $5,180. Amnesty International, which stated she had been brought to stand trial with her legs in shackles, reportedly stated that the judge had ruled that the prosecution's case was based on insufficient and dated evidence. The prosecution was given 3 days to appeal the decision.'Israel to release MP Khalida Jarrar under house arrest', Ma'an News Agency 21 May 2015. The prosecution then appealed the decision to release her on bail, and the court reversed the ruling on May 28, stating Jarrar was a \\"security risk\\" on the basis of secret evidence, according to Addameer The court ordered that she been held in detention until proceedings against her have concluded.'Israeli military court goes back on Jarrar release', Ma'an News Agency2 June 2015.Israeli court keeps Jarrar in detention Her trial is scheduled for June 22.

Cap., () (1556 ‚Äì February 4, 1612) is a saint of the Catholic Church. Life He was born Eufranio Desiderio at Leonessa, a small town then in Umbria, now in the Lazio. It is said that from a young age he showed a remarkably religious bent of mind; he used to erect little altars and spend much time in prayer before them, and often he would gather his companions and induce them to pray with him. Whilst yet a boy he used to take the discipline on Fridays in company with the Confraternity of the Holy Savior. He was educated by his uncle, who had planned a suitable marriage for him, but in his sixteenth year he fell sick of a fever, and upon his recovery, without consulting his guardian, he joined the Capuchin reform of the Franciscan Order.\\"Saint Joseph of Leonissa\\", Franciscan Media He made his novitiate at the friary of the Carcerelle near Assisi. As a friar he was remarkable for his great abstinence. \\"Brother Ass\\", he would say to his body, \\"there is no need to feed thee as a noble horse would be fed: thou must be content to be a poor ass.\\" In 1599, the year before the Jubilee year, he fasted the whole year by way of preparation for gaining the indulgence. At Constantinople In 1587 he was sent by the Minister General of his Order to Constantinople to minister to the Christians held captive there. Arrived there he and his companions lodged in the Galata district in a derelict house of Benedictine monks, actually the St. Benedict high school. The poverty in which the friars lived attracted the attention of the Turks, who went in numbers to see the new missionaries. He was very solicitous in ministering to the captive Christians in the galleys of the Ottoman Empire's navy. Every day he went into the city to preach, and he was at length thrown into prison and only released at the intervention of the Venetian agent. Urged on by zeal he at last sought to enter the palace to preach before Sultan Murad III, but he was seized and condemned to death. For three days he hung on the gallows, held up by two hooks driven through his right hand and foot; his legends state that he was then miraculously released by an angel. Return to Italy Returning to Italy, he took with him a Greek archbishop who had apostatized, and who was reconciled to the Church on their arrival in Rome. Joseph now took up the work of home missions in his native province, sometimes preaching six or seven times a day. In the Jubilee year of 1600 he gave the Lenten sermons at Otricoli, a town through which crowds of pilgrims passed on their way to Rome. Many of them being very poor, Joseph supplied them with food; he also washed their clothes and cut their hair. At Todi he cultivated with his own hands a garden, the produce of which was for the poor. He died at Amatrice in 1612. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XIV in 1746. His feast day is kept on February 4, within the Franciscan Order. In his hometown, there is a church and sanctuary of San Giuseppe da Leonessa. The main street is called the Corso San Giuseppe, after him. Devotion to him is mostly local to central Italy; churches at Otricoli and San Lorenzo Nuovo contain paintings of him.

Introduced in 1966, the M40 was built up from a Remington 700 bolt-action rifle. The major components of sniper equipment are the precision sniper rifle, various optical scopes and field glasses, specialized ammunition and camouflage materials for the sniper‚Äôs body and equipment. A sniper‚Äôs spotter typically also wears camouflage. In the 2010s, a spotter uses various optical gear and in some cases a laser rangefinder. Snipers may also use monopods, bipods or tripods to steady their aim. Sniper rifles H-S Precision Pro Series 2000 HTR sniper rifle with telescopic sight and a bipod. Historic military sniper rifles up to and including the Second World War were usually based on the standard service rifle of the country in question. They included the German Mauser Gewehr 98K, U.S. M1903 Springfield and M1 Garand, Soviet Mosin‚ÄìNagant, Norwegian Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen, Japanese Arisaka, and British Lee‚ÄìEnfield No. 4. Models used for sniping were generally factory tested for accuracy and fitted with specialized components, including not just optics but also such items as slings, cheek pieces, and flash eliminators, which disperse gases at the muzzle away from the sniper's view, helping avoiding having the sniper blinded by the flash. Modern sniper rifles, from the 1960s onwards, have been increasingly purpose-built. The critical goal is reliable placement of the first shot within one MOA (minute of angle). Most include special features for this purpose, including tight building tolerances and precise components. Measures are also taken to ensure the rifle is affected as little as possible by heating, vibration and other effects which may reduce accuracy. Besides that, purpose-built sniper rifle systems often offer factory made accessories like telescopic sight mounting sets, MIL-STD-1913 rails (Picatinny rails), auxiliary iron sights for emergency use, cleaning kits, muzzle brakes/flash-hiders and sound suppressors (silencers), monopods (buttspikes), bipods, handstops, mirage bands, soft and heavy-duty transit cases and various maintenance tools. An example of a non-factory-made accessory could be shooting sticks that can be employed as rifle field rest. Common modern sniper rifles, such as M24 and L96 are widely used by sniper teams. The importance of using anti-materiel rifle was also considered during World War II.  Optics  The sniper and spotter use a wide variety of optics, such as the sniper scope, spotter weapon scope,nowadays in modern warfare there are several improvements in the field of computerised optic and manual optics .A range of devices are used to accurately mark an enemy .it has become a trend to use high caliber rifles . A telescopic sight, commonly called a scope, is an optical sighting device that is based on a refracting telescope.[1] It is equipped with some form of graphic image pattern (a reticle) mounted in an optically appropriate position in its optical system to give an accurate aiming point. Telescopic sights are used with all types of systems that require accurate aiming but are most commonly found on firearms, particularly rifles. Other types of sights are iron sights, reflector (reflex) sights, and laser sights. The optical components may be combined with optoelectronics to form a night scope. binoculars, laser rangefinders and a spotting scope. Ammunition Most snipers are issued with specially developed and manufactured match-grade military ammunition. This ammunition is typically manufactured to highly exacting tolerances and therefore provide improved accuracy over standard military ammunition. This ammunition often features a boat-tail (narrowing at the base end), because it provides better ballistic performance due to the reduced air resistance (drag). Though target shooters often assemble their own ammunition from components to more precisely control the load and tune it to the specific rifle and task, this is practically unknown in military and police circles as this may interfere with various laws. Ideally, a shooter would acquire rounds from a single lot or batch of manufactured ammunition, zero the rifle to that lot, and then use only that ammunition until it runs out. This ensures that every bullet is as similar as possible to the previous one, and assists consistency. However, this is rarely practicable. A sniper will enter information into a Data On Previous Engagement (DOPE) book, such as lot number, temperature, wind speed/direction, humidity and altitude. If the same conditions are encountered again, the data is available to assist in making an accurate shot. Most information gathering must start over if the barrel is replaced, as each barrel has distinct characteristics. Camouflage A camouflaged sniper lying prone Snipers employ camouflage and limit their movements in order to avoid detection. Special care has to be taken with the telescopic sight, because the front lens cannot be fully covered and is made of a highly reflective surface (normally polished glass) off which the glare of the sun can easily reflect, drawing attention to the sniper's position. Common solutions are to avoid exposure to direct sunlight by taking up a position in a shaded area or by covering the lens in non-reflective materials (some type of duct tape, fabric or metal mesh) leaving only a small slit to see through. Snipers also have to take into account their appearance under infrared (IR) light, because many armed forces now employ thermal vision devices that work in this spectrum of light as opposed to normal night vision devices that simply gathers and intensifies normal light. Some clothes or equipment stand out when viewed with thermal vision devices and care has to be taken in selecting and covering equipment so that the sniper is not readily visible when viewed under infrared light. Clothing or equipment not readily visible under infrared light is said to have a \\"low IR signature\\". Plastic or foil \\"thermal blankets\\" can also be employed to cover a sniper and their equipment, but these, in turn, must then be camouflaged (often local foliage or material). = Ghillie suit = Snipers with extreme requirements for infiltration and camouflage use a ghillie suit. The ghillie suit was originally developed by Scottish game wardens to better count game and catch poachers. A US Marine sniper wearing a ghillie suit Ghillie suits can be constructed in several different ways. Some services make them of rough burlap (of the hessian kind) flaps attached to a net punch. U.S. Army ghillie suits are often built using a pilot's flight suit, or some other one-piece coverall as the base. A full cover of rough webbing or fish-netting in a durable fabric is attached in irregular patterns designed to hide lines and blend in. Then, this is weathered using mud, by dragging it under or running over it with a car. When on location, as much of the local foliage as possible without restricting movement is applied to blend in. It is customary for the ghillie suit to be made by the sniper, rather than bought. An inherent problem with ghillie suits is internal temperatures. Even in relatively moderate climates, the temperature inside of the ghillie suit can soar to over 50 ¬∞C (120 ¬∞F).

Gill chose Joanna for setting An Essay on Typography, a book by Gill on his thoughts on typography, typesetting, and page design. He described it as \\"a book face free from all fancy business.\\" Design Joanna is based on the traditional old-style serif model of the Renaissance. However, the spare, sharp squared serifs and minimal contrast of strokes give the design a 20th-century modernist feeling, reminiscent of the Didone and slab serifs of the nineteenth century but far lighter than most typefaces of this genre. This is very similar to Gill's earlier typeface Solus, also rather light and monoline with horizontal serifs similar to Monotype's pre-existing Bodoni 135 typeface. (Solus was never particularly popular, perhaps because it did not have an italic.) Many of the letter forms of Joanna are characteristic of Gill's preferences, for example the lack of serif on the top left of the 'a', the splayed leg of the 'R' and handwriting-like italic 'g', with many similarities to his stonecarving and also to his other serif typefaces, Cockerel and Perpetua, for example in its handwriting-style italic 'g'. The italics are more vertical than traditional, with only a slope of about 3¬∞: indeed, in the original cut Gill did not bother to have italic capitals created, simply using the upright ones. The 'f', too, does not descend below the baseline. A book published by Antonio Blado in 1531, using italics as was normal in the period similarly to Joanna in its first uses: lower-case italics, upper-case upright capitals, relatively moderate slant of the italics. The modern concept of an italic using sloped capitals had not become widespread at this time. History The typeface was originally designed for proprietary use by Gill's printing shop Hague & Gill, run with his son-in-law Ren√© Hague. The type was first produced in a small quantity by the Caslon Foundry for hand composition. In the metal type version, Gill used two sizes of capitals, one to ascender height and one below it that could be used as preferred depending on how strong the capitals were intended to appear. Later around 1937, Monotype recut Joanna for their hot metal typesetting system for exclusive use by publisher J. M. Dent. It was eventually licensed for public release by Monotype in 1958, after Gill's death, when J.M. Dent's exclusivity expired. It was first shown in the Monotype Recorder in 1958, accompanied by an exhibition on his work. Once released widely, prominent users included the Penguin Modern Classics series in their classic blue-grey covers of the 1960s, before they switched to Helvetica. The original metal type, however, was Gill's property, and is now partly in the collection of the Clark Library in Los Angeles.Aid for the Collection on Eric Gill, 1887‚Äì2003. Gill's friend and later bibliographer Robert Harling described it in a 1976 book on Gill's work as innovative in its reduced contrast: \\"the letter-forms have character and beauty, discipline and gaiety. No other alphabet of this century has managed to make typographical affectation so readable....defiant of almost every typographical canon of the day...Joanna Italic is gaily triumphant.\\" =Joanna Nova= Like several Monotype typefaces digitised in the early digital era, the original digital release was criticised for being too light compared to the real thing, though this effect may be compensated for when printing on poor-quality paper into which ink tends to absorb and spread. Monotype released in 2015 a more complete and fuller-bodied digitisation named Joanna Nova (shown), by Ben Jones. All the Monotype versions are somewhat different to the original Caslon type made for Gill, that used in the first edition of An Essay on Typography (historian James Mosley considers it as superior to Monotype's, and Vivian Ridler also felt the Monotype version in some ways less characterful than the metal), and Jones described his goal as being to compromise between the different versions \\"to create a version of Joanna that appears in your mind when you think of Joanna.\\" The family includes 18 fonts in 9 weights and 2 weights, with complementary italics. Character set support includes W1G. Related typefaces =Joanna Hellenic (1998)= Joanna Hellenic is a Greek version of Joanna designed by Hector Haralambous. The family includes 7 fonts in 4 weights and 1 width, with complementary italics on all but the heaviest weight. =Joanna Sans Nova (2015)= Monotype released Joanna Nova in 2015 with a matching sans-serif design by Terrance Weinzierl, Joanna Sans Nova, intended to somewhat resemble Gill Sans but complement Joanna more closely, with a more normally slanted italic not solely inspired by either. The family includes 16 fonts in 8 weights and 2 weights, with complementary italics. Character set support includes W1G. =FF Scala (1990)= One of the typefaces most influenced by Joanna is FF Scala, designed in 1990 by the Dutch type designer Martin Majoor and released by FontFont. It is similar in its geometric simplicity combined with the old-style letterform. Majoor created a complementary sans-serif design, FF Scala Sans. The resulting font superfamily was one of the first such designs to be popular, and remains common in book printing. Joanna is the corporate typeface of the United States' Department of Homeland Security, while Scala is used on its seal. Notes Bibliography *Bringhurst, Robert. The Elements of Typographic Style.

One of these states is the hypothetical point of departure (\\"the original state\\"). According to the compensation principle, if the prospective gainers could compensate (any) prospective losers and leave no one worse off, the alternate state is to be selected (Chipman, 1987, p. 524). An example of a compensation principle is the Pareto criterion in which a change in states entails that such compensation is not merely feasible but required. Two variants are: * the Pareto principle, which requires any change such that all gain. * the (strong) Pareto criterion, which requires any change such that at least one gains and no one loses from the change. In non-hypothetical contexts such that the compensation occurs (say in the marketplace), invoking the compensation principle is unnecessary to effect the change. But its use is more controversial and complex with some losers (where full compensation is feasible but not made) and in selecting among more than two feasible social states. In its specifics, it is also more controversial where the range of the decision rule itself is at issue. Uses for the compensation principle include: * comparisons between the welfare properties of perfect competition and imperfect competition * the Pareto principle in social choice theory * cost‚Äìbenefit analysis.

Part of the Dragonlance series of novels, it is the second novel in the Dragonlance Legends trilogy, which details the journey of the fictional twins Raistlin Majere and Caramon Majere, along with Crysania and Tasslehoff Burrfoot. The book details their adventures during the Dwarfgate Wars, some 100 years after the Cataclysm, a monumental event in the Dragonlance world that altered the shape of the world. The story sees Raistlin, Caramon, and Crysania arrive in the Tower of High Sorcery at Palanthas. Caramon, before bent on stopping Raistlin's quest for godhood, must now aid him to return to his own time period. Plot summary Upon arrival in the Tower of High Sorcery, Raistlin is tested by the undead guardians to prove that he is really the Master of the Tower. It is revealed that he has beaten Fistandantilus and absorbed his soul, thus increasing his power immensely. Raistlin goes to find the Portal to the Abyss, which is necessary to his ascension to godhood. When he goes to it, he discovers that it is not there. Having been bribed with the Globe of Present Time Passing, created by Raistlin, Astinus reveals that it is in the magical fortress of Zhaman, located in dwarven lands. The scene shifts to Tasslehoff Burrfoot, who finds himself in the Abyss. Tasslehoff encounters Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness, who tells him how he has altered time and possibly allowed her to take over the world. Tas meets Gnimsh, a gnome, who claims he is a failure because all of his inventions worked (gnomes in the Dragonlance world constantly invent, and more often than not they fail. The gnomes believe failure is a means of learning). Gnimsh agrees to help Tasslehoff get out of the Abyss and starts to fix the device of Time Journeying. Caramon, Raistlin, and Crysania create the so-called Fistandantilus Army from local populace under pretension of ravaging the dwarven kingdom Thorbadin in the far South, with Caramon being their leader. Many come to join his army, and they number several hundred. The army continues south. The hill dwarves join up with Caramon's army, believing that the mountain dwarves have stolen supplies and wealth from them. Crysania flees when Raistlin rejects her love and makes plans to bring word of the true gods to the people, 200 years before Goldmoon would during the War of the Lance. She encounters a place stricken by plague and finds a dying false cleric, who she tries to convert. She discovers that people are still too angry to accept the true gods yet. Raistlin and Caramon begin to joke and share memories. Later, Raistlin and Caramon go to the village where Crysania is. Raistlin uses his immense power to summon a massive fire that razes the town. He is in fact preparing Crysania to come with him into the Abyss with trials comparable to Huma Dragonbane's. Caramon and his army soon capture the fortress of Pax Tharkas, thanks to the help of traitorous dark dwarves. The mountain dwarves retreat to Thorbardin and close the gates, preparing for war. Kharas, the dwarf hero, led a daring assassination attempt on Raistlin. Kharas wounds him drastically, but Raistlin has time before death. Crysania heals Raistlin, perhaps against his will. It is then discovered that Tas and Gnimsh have escaped the Abyss and were captured in Thorbardin. Raistlin appears and rescues Tas, but kills Gnimsh, presumably to correct Fistandantilus's mistake of allowing the gnome to be at the Portal when he tried to enter. Soon after, it is revealed that the dark dwarves betrayed them and had slowly killed off the hill dwarves. They attempt to assassinate Caramon, but are beaten back. Raistlin, after a last talk with his brother, opens the Portal with Crysania's help; at the same time Caramon and Tas activate their device, returning to their proper time period. The result is the explosion that levels Zhaman; however, this time, Crysania and Raistlin enter the Portal whereas Denubis, Crysania's equivalent in the past, had died and Fistandantilus had departed that plane of existence. The book ends with Raistlin entering the Abyss.

The facility is now operating as Chantier Davie Canada Inc. History The Davie shipyard in Lauzon, Quebec has a complex ownership history. =19th century= The Davie shipyard was founded in 1825 by Allison Davie (May 4, 1796 ‚Äì June 1836), an English ship captain; the construction record, however, only dates to 1897. The company was established on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River across from Quebec City in the community of Lauzon, Quebec (now part of the city of Levis, Quebec). Davie's father-in-law, George Taylor, had begun a shipbuilding business in 1811 and Davie apparently purchased those assets as well. Following Allison Davie's death, the company was headed by his wife Elizabeth Davie until 1850, when it became \\"George T. Davie & Sons\\" under Davie's son George Taylor Davie (1828‚Äì1907). It changed its name in 1914 to \\"Davie Shipbuilding & Repairing.\\" The Davie family sold the shipyard to Canada Steamship Lines (CSL) in 1929 but started the \\"George T. Davie shipyard\\" immediately next door to the larger Lauzon facility. The second shipyard was managed by sons Allison Cufaude Davie and George Duncan Davie, with the former taking full control following the death of the latter in 1937. Davie's Brothers Limited remained in family ownership until 1951 and was owned by Logistec Corporation (1971) and finally, √âquimer (1987) before the yard closed for good in 1989. =20th century= The company built a wide range of vessels in the 1800s and the first half of the 20th century, ranging from wooden sailing vessels and steamers to modern steel ships, both cargo and passenger carriers. During World War II, Davie built 35 warships (minesweepers, corvettes and destroyers). On October 27, 1955, the Davie yard was almost destroyed by a massive fire which started in the foundry. It lasted eight hours, and although no one was injured many employees were left unemployed for several months. By the 1970s, Canada Steamship Lines was owned by Power Corporation and in a 1976 restructuring, it sold the Davie yard to Societ√© de Construction Navale (Soconav) which was established by former employees of Marine Industries Ltd with the financial backing of the Quebec provincial government's Societ√© G√©n√©rale de Financement. In 1981 the Davie shipyard was sold to Dome Petroleum and in 1985 it was sold to Versatile Corporation which changed the name of the shipyard to \\"Versatile Davie Incorporated\\". In the 1970s to 1980s the Davie yard built oil rigs and some warships. However, after CSL ended its ownership the company began to fail. By the 1980s, the company was in financial trouble and was bailed out by both the provincial and federal governments. In 1986 the federal government asked Quebec to rationalize its shipyards. Marine Industries Ltd (MIL) merged with Versatile Davie Inc to become MIL-Davie Shipbuilding. Under this new arrangement, MIL's shipyard in Sorel, Quebec was called \\"M.I.L. Tracy\\" (for Tracy, Quebec, a neighborhood of Sorel) and the former Davie yard in Lauzon was called \\"M.I.L. Lauzon.\\" Shortly after the merger, the new company, MIL- Davie Shipbuilding closed the Sorel shipyard along with the Versatile Vickers shipyard in Montreal, resulting in a total loss of 1,700 jobs but kept the Lauzon yard open as it was working on building two large vessels for Marine Atlantic and three warships for the Royal Canadian Navy's Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. After the warship project was finished in the early 1990s, MIL-Davie Shipbuilding, along with the Davie yard in Lauzon went into receivership. After being bought by the Quebec government, Davie was sold to Dominion Bridge Company for $1. In 1998, the parent Dominion Bridge Company went into bankruptcy and the Davie shipyard went into trusteeship in 1998. It was sold again in 2000 and became \\"Industries Davie, Ltd\\". During this period, the company undertook a number of projects involving vessels and rigs which serve the offshore oil and gas market. These included the upgrade of a semi- submersible platform for Petrobras and the conversion of a vessel for pipe laying. =21st century= In 2006, the shipyard was almost auctioned in June,canada.com: \\"Davie on the brink\\" 20 May 2006 before it was sold to TECO Maritime ASA of Norway and was restructured into a new company called Davie Yards Incorporated. In February 2010 TECO received protection from its creditors. It employed at the time, 1,000 people. Investissement Qu√©bec held CAD$28 million in share capital, so Davie can be considered partly an SOE. In early 2011, TECO announced that Davie Yards Inc announced a bid by Fincantieri ‚Äì Cantieri Navali Italiani of Italy and Fincantieri subsidiary DRS Technologies Canada to purchase the shipyard from TECO. This deal fell through in July 2011. After the Fincantieri deal fell through, the yard underwent financial restructuring in July 2011 in order to qualify to bid for a portion of the first stages of the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy (NSPS) which will see ships built for the Canadian Coast Guard, Royal Canadian Navy and Department of Fisheries and Oceans, for a total value of CAD$33 billion or $35 billion. The NSPS had its bidding deadline extended by three weeks specifically to accommodate the Davie restructuring. As part of the restructuring, on 21 July 2011 Upper Lakes Groups Inc. (owner of Seaway Marine & Industrial Inc. in St. Catharines) bought the assets of the bankrupt Davie Yards Inc. The Canadian engineering conglomerate SNC-Lavalin, Upper Lakes Groups Inc. and South Korean shipbuilder Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) had formalized the week before a joint venture to bid for the contract. The new company bore the name Chantier Davie Canada Inc. Davie was not selected for the first contracts in the NSPS program, which went instead to Vancouver Shipyards, a subsidiary of Seaspan, and Halifax Shipyards, a unit of the Irving Group of Companies. Vancouver Shipyards obtained an $8 billion contract to supply the Coast Guard, while Halifax Shipyards obtained a contract valued at $25 billion to supply the Navy. Each ship is worth $1 billion. The Davie bid was only for the Coast Guard contract. Davie had only 15 employees during this time. Provincial politicians had no power over the bidding process due to the federal nature of the contracts. DSME canceled its involvement in the joint venture at this loss. SNC-Lavalin withdrew from the joint venture in May 2012, under a cloud of controversy, as its CEO had resigned in March 2012. Upper Lakes, which was at the time the only owner of the yard, sold it in November 2012 to a partnership between Zafiro Marine of the UK and the Norwegian operator Cecon ASA, the latter of which encountered financial difficulties during the bid from which it emerged with its fleet intact. The S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec on 5 December 2012 opened an investigation over government interference, influence peddling, corruption on the allegations of Michel Juneau-Katsuya, who at the time was president of a failed bidder for the assets. He had previously been employed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. The Government of Quebec, and its agent Investissement Quebec, had $100 million at risk. Juneau-Katsuya alleged that manager Richard Bertrand had solicited a bribe. Zafiro Marine later changed its name to Inocea and kept the Davie name for its Canadian operations. Davie launched MV in October 2013; it was the first ship launched from the yard in over a decade. Davie CEO Alan Bowen said \\"This is a great day for Davie. There are only a handful of shipyards across the globe, mainly in Europe, capable of building a vessel to this specification and with this level of technology.\\" It was the 717th ship built at the yard. The vessel was scheduled for final delivery to Cecon ASA in February 2014. \\"It's used for multi-purpose applications. From pipe laying to subsea construction to deep sea well intervention, it's really about the deep sea,\\" said Alex Vicefield, chairman of the shipyard. Export Development Canada forgave a loan to Cecon ASA\\"Norsk Tillitsmann: Summons to Bondholders' meeting\\", esp see Schedule 3. of approximately $216 million during the Zafiro-Cecon sale process, which had tied up for many years three partly finished keels: the above-mentioned Cecon Pride, Sovereign and Excellence. In 2014, Minister of Public Works and Government Services Diane Finley turned down Davie's bid to build Canada's next icebreaker, saying that the $500 million that the firm's fixed price offer would save the taxpayer over the Seaspan bid was rejected \\"based on the credibility, the viability, the reliability of the companies\\". In 2018 Davie, along with Victoria Shipyards and Halifax Shipyards, agreed to share a $7 billion contract to maintain and repair the s, and will share with Halifax six ships based on the east coast. This was later clarified as a $500 million contract for the maintenance of three east coast frigates. It is the largest contract the shipyard has ever signed.

The Impossibles were among the first Thai pop bands to cover English-language songs and were the first Thai rock band to record an English-language album overseas, during a tour of Europe. In addition to rock and pop, the band's sound frequently crossed over into funk, R&B;, country and folk. They did two covers of Kool and the Gang tracks (\\"Give it Up\\" and \\"Love the Life You Live\\") on their 1975 album \\"Hot Pepper\\", an all-English lyrics recording.

Originally known as Colm√°n (variously rendered Koloman, K√°lm√°n, Colman, and Colomannus), he was an Irish pilgrim en route to the Holy Land and was mistaken for a spy because of his strange appearance. He was tortured and hanged at Stockerau, near Vienna, Austria, on 16 July 1012. Later tradition has it that he was \\"a son of M√°el-Sechnaill (d. 1022), high king of Ireland.\\" (Breen, 2009) At the time of his death, there were continual skirmishes among Austria, Moravia, and Bohemia. Coloman spoke no German, so he could not give an understandable account of himself. He was hanged alongside several robbers. According to Aidan Breen, \\"He was made a saint by the local people, possibly out of remorse for the deed and because of his endurance under torture and the many miracles reported from where his body was buried.\\" (Breen, 2009) Veneration Sarcophagus of Coloman. Melk Abbey, Austria. On 13 October 1014, his relics were transferred to the Abbey of Melk by Bishop Megingard at the request of Marquis Saint Henry of Austria. Decades later, they were taken to Hungary. Coleman became the object of a popular cult, and many churches and chapels in Austria, the Electorate of the Palatinate, Hungary, and Bavaria were dedicated to him. He is also venerated in Ireland. A legend states that Coleman's body remained incorruptible for eighteen months, remaining undisturbed by birds and beasts. The scaffolding itself is said to have taken root and to have blossomed with green branches, one of which is preserved under the high altar of the Franciscan church at Stockerau. G√©za I of Hungary named one of his sons, King Coleman of Hungary, in his honor. In the 13th century, the younger brother of King Bela IV of Hungary was named Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria in honor of the saint. Eventually, the relics of Saint Coleman were taken back from the Cathedral of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r to Melk Abbey in Austria, where they are still kept. Many Austrian rulers made modifications to the tomb of this saint, and the actual reliquary was made in the Baroque style.

He is currently serving life in prison without parole in Illinois. Earlier confrontations with police On both December 10 and 13, 1978, Chicago police were contacted by Allen's common-law wife, Bianca Smith, who complained of having \\"problems\\" with Allen, and that he was heavily armed. Officers were both times dispatched to Allen and Smith's residence to deal with the domestic complaints. The second time, Allen was refusing Smith entry to their shared residence, and demonstrated his willingness to continue to do so by brandishing various firearms at police from his front doorstep and telling the officers \\"the next fucking pig that puts his foot on my property, I'm going to blow his head off\\" and \\"you motherfuckers are all going to pay for this.\\" Eventually, after a nineteen-hour standoff and in front of several Chicago TV crews, Allen surrendered to the police without a shot being fired. While Allen was incarcerated pending bail for this incident, Judge Everette Braden issued a search warrant for Allen's home. It was executed later that day, while Allen was still in jail, whereupon officers retrieved the following firearms: * one Colt .45 semiautomatic pistol * one Smith & Wesson revolver, model 27 * one Smith & Wesson revolver, model 57 * one Colt .357 Python revolver * one .44 Ruger Super Blackhawk revolver * one Winslow 7mm rifle * one Weatherby 12-gauge shotgun Along with over a thousand rounds of various kinds of ammunition. Officers on the scene of the standoff claimed to have seen Allen at times bearing a gun that appeared to be an M16 rifle, however no such gun was recovered by the officers executing the search warrant. Upon returning home from jail, Allen was furious that his guns had been confiscated. He contacted lawyer Kermit Coleman to sue for their return, but was informed it was unlikely he would ever get them back from the police. The murders Three months later, Allen still seethed with resentment over the incident. Early in the afternoon of March 3, 1979, Allen visited a locksmith and glazier with a curious question. He wanted to know if the glass in Chicago police cruisers was bulletproof. The proprietor of the shop, Stanley Evans, told him that only Chicago riot wagons had bulletproof glass. Two and a half hours later, Allen parked his brown Ford across the street from Chicago police officers William Bosak and Roger van Schaik as they were conducting a routine traffic stop. With the officer's back to him, Allen opened fire on Bosak with a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, emptying the magazine. Bosak was hit three times and was killed instantly. Allen drew a second pistol and exited his car to engage Van Schaik‚Äîwho was on the opposite side of the unmarked police cruiser from Allen‚Äîin a gun battle, the two men circling the officers' car. Both men exhausted their ammunition without scoring a hit. Allen then returned to his car and retrieved a .30 caliber carbine rifle, again opening fire on Van Schaik, wounding but not killing the officer. The rifle jammed after two or three shots. While Van Schaik lay wounded on the ground, Allen retrieved the .38 caliber service revolver from the corpse of Officer Bosak. He returned to the front of the car where the wounded Van Schaik lay, pleading for his life, and executed him with two shots to the face at point blank range. Allen remained on the scene until two other officers arrived in response to the distress call. He initially fled in his car but quickly returned, attempting to shoot the officers as he drove past. Several more squad cars arrived in pursuit of Allen, still firing from the windows with the service revolver and a now unjammed carbine. After two collisions with police cruisers and one with a CTA bus, Allen was finally stopped when Officer Lawrence Rapien intentionally steered his cruiser head on into Allen's car. Several guns were confiscated from Allen's car, along with about 250 rounds of ammunition, and a notebook containing the names, addresses, license plate numbers and phone numbers of several police officers and Everette Braden, the judge who had signed the search warrant authorizing Chicago Police to enter Allen's home. The trial and afterwards Kenneth Allen represented himself at his trial and sentencing hearing. He pleaded guilty to the murders of Bosak and Van Schaik. In court he stated he had killed the officers for committing \\"another violation of the people's rights by police\\" (i.e. the traffic stop), and because he recognized‚Äîmistakenly‚ÄîBosak from the standoff at his house on December 13. Neither officer had been present at that incident. Because of this, and because of evidence‚Äîthe large amount of ammunition, the notebook, the earlier questioning of the glazier‚Äîthe jury agreed that he had premeditated the killings, Allen was sentenced to death. Kenneth Allen remained under a sentence of death for many years before his sentence was commuted in 2003 in controversial circumstances by embattled Governor of Illinois George Ryan. As his last act in office, Ryan commuted (to \\"life\\") the sentences of all 167 convicts on or waiting to be sent to Illinois' Death Row.CNN.com - 'Blanket commutation' empties Illinois death row - Jan. 13, 2003 Kenneth Allen remains in Menard Correctional Center.

History Inside of Fort Purcell, better known as \\"The Dungeons\\" The Fort was built by the Dutch at an unascertained date in either the late 16th or very early 17th century, and was known by the Spanish authorities in Puerto Rico as the \\"donjon\\" (from which the English name, \\"the Dungeon\\" comes ‚Äì the fort has never actually been used as a dungeon).It has been suggested that the earthen fort was originally constructed by the Spanish, and this is why the name has stuck, but there is little evidence to support any Spanish settlement of the Territory prior to the Dutch. The fort was originally only earthen, and was occupied intermittently, but it was restored by the Dutch privateer Joost van Dyk in 1625 or 1626. Documents from archives in Seville, Spain, report about two attacks that the Spanish made on Tortola in 1646 and 1647. The reports indicate that the Spanish anchored a warship in Soper's Hole at West End and landed men ashore. They then sent another warship to blockade Road Harbour. After a team of scouts returned a safe report, the Spanish landed more men and attacked Fort Purcell by foot from the land. The Dutch were massacred and the Spanish soldiers then moved overland to Road Town. The Fort fell into disrepair, but was restored in the early 1650s during the First Anglo‚ÄìDutch War. Reports of the next vary according to historical sources. Dutch historians aver that at the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, the then (Dutch) owner of Tortola, Willem Hunthum, put Tortola under the protection of Sir William Stapleton, the English Governor-General of the Leeward Islands. Colonel William Burt was dispatched to Tortola to oversee the annexation on the understanding that the island would be returned to the Dutch when peace was declared. However, the British decided that Tortola had strategic importance and reneged upon the bargain, retaining control of the island. But before leaving the island, Colonel Burt destroyed the Dutch forts and removed all their cannon to avoid any inclination of the Dutch settlers to rebel. The English version suggests that Colonel Burt was sent to attack Tortola with a meagre force of 100 men, but that the Dutch immediately surrendered. Recognising that he could not hold the island, Burt dismantled the forts and removed the weaponry before returning to Saint Kitts. After the end of the war, the Dutch asked for return of the island, but the British declined. Fort Purcell was not rebuilt. Part of Fort Purcell, better known as \\"The Dungeons\\" Accordingly, in 1686, when pirates attacked a new British settlement, there was no fort and the island was taken easily. By 1715, the fort had still not been rebuilt when Captain Chandler, on HMS Winchelsey, made a report on the islands. The population and economic activity on Tortola expanded, and the question of fortification of the island became more pressing. In the early 1750s, Governor Purcell wrote to the Lords of Trade and Plantations that he had rebuilt a fort with four bastions on the site of the original Dutch fort which had been laid to ruin by the British in 1672 (it is presumably at this point Fort Purcell was named or renamed after the Purcell brothers, James Purcell (1750-1751) and John Purcell (1751-1775) who served as Presidents of the British Virgin Islands Council consecutively from ; their plantations were in this area and the fort was rebuilt privately to protect their interests; planters would also have had to erect batteries and forts at their own expense at the time, to protect the individual plantations in secluded bays not covered by the Government forts). With the subsequent severe economic decline of the islands which accompanied the abolition of slavery, the Purcell plantation was abandoned, and the fort fell into ruin. Structure The use of different stone types in various parts of the building shows the evolution of the building's construction. Inside one of the rooms are a series of graffiti drawings carved into the wall by a bored member of the garrison. One drawing shows a dancing girl and another, an officer or gentleman in a three quarter length coat. By dating the clothing worn by the people in the drawings we able to see that the fort would have been garrisoned during the Seven Years' War which took place between 1756-63. A red brick staircase leads to the gun battery which would have mounted six guns allowing the fort to completely cover the surrounding area of the Sir Francis Drake Channel. There is also a water cistern and a number of masonry platforms that would once have had wooden buildings on them for the officers and garrison accommodation. Today Not unusually for historical buildings in the British Virgin Islands, Fort Purcell is on private land (the land was owned by the late Cyril Romney, a former chief minister of the Territory). However, it is freely accessible and often visited by tourists. Periodically suggestion is made that the government should acquire the site and clean it up, but this has not happened. The island does not treat the ruins especially well today. They are not protected or preserved by law, and the area surrounding the Fort is often used as a dumping ground for waste (ironically enough, the incinerator for destroying rubbish, for which there is no charge in the Territory, lies less than half a mile away in Pockwood Pond). The ruins become heavily overgrown during the rainy season. There are also periodic reports of amateur archaeologists using metal detectors and removing historical artifacts from the unexcavated areas around the site.

The first mention of the stone circle in modern times, in 1754, is found in the work Antiquities, historical and monumental, of the County of Cornwall by William Borlase, who reported 19 upright standing stones. William Copeland Borlase, a descendant of the earlier Borlase, conducted excavations and found a cist and a funerary urn near the stone circle, dating from the early Bronze Age. Borlase described his discoveries in 1872 in his work Naenia Cornubiae, which concerns prehistoric monuments of Cornwall.

Alongside Cuban-born Roland Alphonso, Barbadian Jackie Opel and fellow Trinidadians Lynn Taitt and Lord Brynner, Lord Creator was an important and positive \\"outside\\" influence during the early development of the Jamaican music scene. Career He started as a calypso singer in Trinidad under the stage name Lord Creator and recorded his first hits, \\"The Cockhead\\" and \\"Evening News\\", in Trinidad in 1958 and 1959 respectively with Fitz Vaughan Bryan's big band. Due to the success of his hit \\"Evening News\\", which was released in Trinidad on the Cook label and also in the UK on the Melodisc label, he moved to Jamaica in late 1959 to perform and record and decided to settle there. In 1962, he recorded \\"Independent Jamaica\\" with producer Vincent \\"Randy\\" Chin,Campbell, Howard (2012) \\"Lord Creator marks JA's Independence celebration\\", Jamaica Observer, 3 August 2012.

After \\"Little Princess\\" in 1964, he recorded a calypso album, Jamaica Time, at Studio One. It included calypso classics like \\"Jamaica Farewell\\" and \\"Yellowbird\\", as well as a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". His next album, Big Bamboo, was recorded at Dynamic Studios sometime after 1969, when the studio was established by Byron Lee. Carlton Lee is listed as the producer. Creator had another big hit with \\"Kingston Town\\", a tune he recorded for producer Clancy Eccles in 1970. After that, Lord Creator virtually disappeared from the music industry; although in 1976, he still recorded \\"Big Pussy Sally\\", a no-holding-back, free-spirited song which was done on the same tape as Fay Bennett's equally lewd and light- hearted \\"Big Cocky Wally\\" for Lee 'Scratch' Perry in the Black Ark studio. Both songs were released on two separate Island Records singles in the UK, both on the B-side accompanied by two different Upsetters dubs. In 1978 Creator returned to the Black Ark to re-record his in 1968 in Randys studio recorded, Vincent Chin produced song, \\"Such is Life\\". He returned to Trinidad and Tobago after suffering two strokes. In 1989, the British band UB40 recorded a cover version of \\"Kingston Town\\", which helped to revive Lord Creator's career.

The copy had been made from a manuscript found by his friend Du Pin during the siege of Belgrade in 1688. Nodot published a new edition of the Satyricon at Paris in 1693.

Maull's barbecue sauce is a popular barbecue sauce in St. Louis, Missouri and is a common ingredient in preparing St. Louis-style barbecue. It is a rich and pungent, spicy semi- sweet, tomato based sauce, somewhat unusual for containing anchovies and pepper pulp. Maull's makes eight varieties of sauce now: Genuine, Sweet-N- Mild, Sweet-N-Smokey, Onion Bits, Beer Flavor, Smokey, Jalape√±o, and they even make a Kansas City-style barbecue sauce. History of the company The Louis Maull company started in 1897 as a grocery business selling out of a horse- drawn wagon. In 1905 it was incorporated as the Louis Maull Cheese and Fish company and had switched to wholesale distributing to restaurants and grocery stores. Starting in 1920 they were selling a line of condiments. Only by 1926 did they create a barbecue sauce recipe. It eventually became their most popular product, and they eliminated their other interests to focus solely on its manufacture and distribution. The company remains a family owned business in St. Louis.

She recalls sitting for hours copying words from an Arabic grammar without trying to understand the meaning of the words. Her art is very much influenced by early hurufiyya artists including; Iraqi artist, Jawad Salim, Palestinian writer and artist, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra and Iraqi painter Shakir Hassan al Said, who rejected Western aesthetics and embraced a new art form which was both modern and yet referenced traditional culture, media and techniques.Quilty, J., \\"Arabic art embraces politics and heritage,' The Daily Star, 24 April 2003, Online: http://www.dailystar.com.lb/ArticlePrint.aspx?id=102634&mode;=print Inspired by Japanese leporellos, Adnan also paints landscapes on to foldable screens that can be \\"extended in space like free-standing drawings\\".

Le Th√©√¢tre du Soleil is located at La Cartoucherie, a former munitions factory in the Vincennes area of eastern Paris. The company creates new theatrical works using a devising process based on utilizing physical theatre and improvisation. Sociohistorical context The Theatre du Soleil was founded as a theatre collective in 1964, in the midst of cultural turmoil that was sweeping the western world. With the capitalist west and the Communist east locked in the midst of the Cold War, nuclear warfare was imminent while the whole of Europe was slowly recovering from the destruction of World War II. In 1965 Charles de Gaulle was re-elected President of France in the first election with direct popular vote for the office. The year 1968, a watershed for protests and turmoil around the world, was characterized by rebellion against conventional culture, huge political demonstrations, and labor strikes in France involving 11 million workers, students, and far-left politicians. It was in the middle of this period of uncertainty, changing cultural attitudes, and disillusionment that Mnouchkine, a student in land, started Le Theatre du Soleil with her peers who were interested in creating original theatre.

Although they have never presented a formalized mission statement, from their inception they have been characterized by a commitment to long-term collaborative rehearsal processes; the merging of a wide variety of art forms both Western and non- Western, including music, dance, and puppetry; actively communicating and mingling with their audiences; and maintaining a large, hierarchy-free company that lives together and equally shares the work of creating their productions. Company members describe working for the Theatre du Soleil as \\"a style of life\\", while a reviewer for The New York Times said of their production Les Ephemeres: \\"The aim here is not to shape life into taut dramatic form but to present lived experience intimately and without evidence of artists' interpretation and manipulation.\\" Mnouchkine summarized the philosophy of the organization as \\"Theatre du Soleil is the dream of living, working, being happy and searching for beauty and for goodness‚Ä¶.It's trying to live for higher purposes, not for richness. It's very simple, really.\\" The company's productions have included both re-imaginings of classics of Western theatre such as Shakespeare's Richard II and Moliere's Tartuffe, but the company is equally well known for their original works. The collective, consisting of 70 members as of July 2009, takes the concept and direction for their original productions from founder Ariane Mnouchkine, and works together in a collaborative rehearsal process that stretches out over many months to create a finished performance event. For example, their six-hour-long 2005 production Le Dernier Caravans√©rail (Odyss√©es) was based on a compilation of letters and interviews collected by Mnouchkine and her colleagues from refugee camps from around the world, while Les Ephemeres in 2009 was based on nine months of improvisations stemming from Mnouchkine's question: What would you do if you found out that all of humanity would die out within three months? At other times, they provocatively, directly comment on contemporary events, such as their production of Tartuffe in which the title character was presented as an Islamic zealot at a time when there was a movement in France against foreign immigration. They have drawn inspiration from non-Western cultures, such as when they used bunraku-style puppetry in their production Tambours sur la Digue. The company's emphasis on movement and physical theatre is in part due to Mnouchkine's study under Jacques Lecoq. Their performances also frequently feature direct contact between the actors and the audience members, whether through a dressing and makeup area that is open to the public's view or lunch for both actors and audience served at intermission. Beyond their production process, part of the company's philosophy includes communal living and a complete lack of hierarchy for every member of the organization. All employees, whether actors, administrators, or technicians, are paid the exact same wage, and must sometimes go without a salary for months when the company is not performing and earning income. The company lives together in shared housing and equally shares the work of cooking, cleaning, and otherwise maintaining their living space. In addition, all performers do technical work on productions, such as maintaining moving set pieces for Les Ephemeres. Major works The Theatre du Soleil's premiere performance was in 1964‚Äì65 with Les Petits Bourgeois. The company's first widely recognized production was in 1967 with Arnold Wesker's 1957 play The Kitchen. They continued on to form a theatre collective and produce their first major success 1789, a show about the French Revolution. Their performance suggested \\"the Revolution was subverted by those more concerned about property than justice\\". Another of the company's most famous works was Les Atrides. This was made up of Euripides' Iphigenia at Aulis and Aeschylus' The Oresteia. The production took over two years to mount, played in numerous countries including the United States and Germany, and integrated several forms of Asian dance and drama. In 2005, Le Theatre du Soleil presented Le Dernier Caravanserail (Odyssees) or The Last Caravansary (Odysseys). One of the company's most recent major works was their production of Les Ephemeres created and directed by Ariane Mnouchkine. The show premiered at the 2009 Lincoln Center Festival. Les Ephemeres is centered on the river of time with its events both past and present. The Village Voice characterized the show's theme as \\"To go with the flow, to accept the fact that time is the great devastator. Tout passe, tout casse, tout basse, says a French proverb: Everything passes, everything breaks, everything sinks.\\" The performance is split in two three-and-a-half-hour-long sections with the full run time just over seven hours long. Major players While Ariane Mnouchkine, acknowledged as the founder of the troupe, regularly acts as the company's concept creator and director, a number of her fellow students were also her collaborators in the initial founding of the company, including: *Georges Donzenac‚Äîphysical training, physical education teacher *Myrrha Donzenac‚Äîactress *Gerard Hardy‚Äîactor *Philippe Leotard‚Äîactor *Roberto Moscoso‚Äîdesigner *Jean-Claude Penchenat‚Äîactor, director *Jean-Pierre Tailhade‚Äîactor *Francoise Tournafond‚Äîcostume designer Senior members such as Mnouchkine are not given preferential treatment. Mnouchkine, for example, refused to be interviewed alone for a New York Times article, although individuals such as Helene Cixous (playwright) and Jean-Jacques Lemetre (composer and musician) repeatedly fulfill specific production roles and have done so for many years.

Though born in London, his Irish ancestry allowed him to be capped by Republic of Ireland at Youth, Under-21 and B levels. Power played in three qualifiers in the 1990 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship qualifying campaign and in the 1990 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship as well as the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship. Playing career Power began his career as a trainee with Norwich City, making his first-team debut against Aston Villa in April 1990, before turning professional in June the same year. His initial form was good enough to earn a call-up to the Republic of Ireland Under-21 side and he went on to make a then record number of appearances (13) for them. Despite a promising start to his Norwich career, Power struggled to maintain a regular place in the first team, particularly with competition from the likes of Chris Sutton and Efan Ekoku. He requested a transfer and moved to Charlton Athletic on loan in December 1992. Further loan spells with Sunderland (in August 1993) and Portsmouth (in October 1993) followed before a ¬£200,000 move to Bradford City in March 1994. He scored on his Bradford debut, a 2‚Äì1 win at home to Swansea City on 12 March 1994, but his progress was impeded by a virus that threatened his career. In July 1995 he moved to Peterborough United for a fee of ¬£80,000, subsequently moving to Scottish League side Dundee in December 1996. He scored twice on his Dundee debut, a 6‚Äì0 victory over East Fife, and his form soon attracted the attention of other clubs. After Dundee's manager Jim Duffy moved to Hibernian he signed Power and his teammate Paul Tosh for a combined fee of ¬£200,000 in March 1997. Power was a Hibs regular for the remainder of the 1996‚Äì97 season, but lost his place when Alex McLeish took over as manager and was allowed to join Ayr United on a free transfer in March 1998 until the end of the season. In July 1998, Power had a trial with Carlisle United, playing in a friendly against Rangers, but joined Plymouth Argyle later that month. He struggled to settle at Plymouth and in December 1998 joined Halifax Town on loan, the move becoming permanent in January 1999. His final footballing move, on the playing side, came in November 1999 when he joined Southern League side Boston United for a fee of ¬£25,000. He also coached Boston, but left in January 2001. His early retirement from football came at the relatively early age of 28, though was not entirely surprising after two broken legs. Post-playing career Power worked as a football agent before joining forces with Danny Lake and setting up the sports publishing company CRE8. Power is also a racehorse owner. In May 2003, Power was part of a consortium that aimed to take over Luton Town. The proposed move was not well received by Luton fans, particularly as it involved sacking the popular manager Joe Kinnear. He subsequently joined the board at Cambridge United and took over as chairman of the-then Conference National side in August 2006. In September 2006 he acted as caretaker manager following the dismissal of manager Rob Newman and his assistant Tony Spearing. On 22 January 2008, on the same night that Cambridge United beat Droylsdon 5‚Äì0, Power resigned as chairman of the club, citing personal differences with fellow board members as the chief reason. In April 2008, Power joined the board of Cambridge's Conference rivals Rushden and Diamonds. Power joined the board of directors at Swindon Town and took an ownership stake in the club in April 2013. He invested ¬£1.2 million in the club, which enabled a transfer embargo to be lifted. Power took full control of Swindon Town in December 2013. On 18 October 2015, Power took 'temporary' control over Swindon's first- team affairs following Mark Cooper's departure from the club. In November 2016 Power agreed a deal to become owner and chairman of Irish club Waterford United. He said there were a number of reasons behind the deal, claiming that the facilities in Waterford were Premier League standard and better than Swindon's. Power also said he was attracted by the club's highly successful youth system. In addition, Power had family from Waterford, his Irish descent having enabled him to play for the Republic of Ireland at international level, so the deal was, in his words, \\"a no-brainer\\". He went on to appoint Pat Fenlon as director of football and Alan Reynolds as head coach for the 2017 season. He also changed the club's crest and changed the club's name back to its original identity of Waterford FC. References External links *Career information at Ex-Canaries.co.uk * *Profile at UpThePosh!

Vinson, the son of Ronald Vinson, a farmer, was educated at Pangbourne. After school he served in the Queen's Royal Regiment from 1948 to 1950, reaching the rank of Lieutenant. In 1952 Vinson, then aged 21, set up a small plastics company, later to be named Plastic Coatings, with two employees. The company, which operated from a Nissen hut in Guildford, was one of the first to find the technical means to apply a thin coat of plastic to metal and to recognise the huge number of applications that this would have. By 1969 when the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange, it employed over 1,000 employees in five different locations, winning the Queen's Award for Industry in 1971. At the time of the flotation, Vinson gave 10 percent of the shares to the company's employees before selling his own stake in the firm to Imperial Tobacco, resigning as executive chairman a year later. Vinson's decision to give up a full-time business career was the result of his determination to find a role for himself in reversing economic and political trends which he believed would have left Britain poorer and less free and to champion the concept of a social market economy. After a failed attempt to be selected as the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Aldershot in 1974, he sought instead to assist others directly engaged in seeking to challenge the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Introduced to Anthony Fisher, the eccentric old Etonian founder of the IEA, Vinson gave money to the Institute at a time when its finances were precarious and its survival uncertain. Vinson became an IEA trustee, chairman of its trustees from 1989-95 and life IEA vice-president, becoming a close friend and ally of Ralph Harris (later Lord Harris of High Cross), the Institute's General Director. Harris introduced Vinson to Sir Keith Joseph who had broken with his party's commitment to the neo-Keynesian middle way in favour of market-based policies. In 1974, Vinson joined Joseph and Margaret Thatcher as a co founder of the Centre for Policy Studies which, according to Thatcher, \\"was where our Conservative revolution began.\\" Vinson, who found the Centre's first premises, underwrote the lease and employed its staff, served as honorary treasurer as well as contributing to the intellectual life of the think-tank. The role of the Centre was \\"to act as outsider, skirmisher, trail-blazer, to moot new ideas and policies. Our task was to question the unquestioned, think the unthinkable, blaze new trails...\\" Vinson was the co-author of the Centre's first publication, Why Britain Needs a Social Market Economy (1974). According to Vinson's biographer he may have been influential in persuading Joseph not to stand for the Tory party leadership because the latter was temperamentally unsuited to the role, thereby setting the stage for Thatcher to enter the leadership race in 1975. When he resigned as CPS treasurer in 1980, Thatcher acknowledged in a personal letter of thanks the part Vinson had played in changing the direction of British politics: \\"What has been achieved during the last six years by way of winning the intellectual argument in favour of free enterprise and against socialism and corporatism would never have been possible without your patient guidance and tireless ability to provide, and then maintain, the foundation stone on which we have built.\\" According to a study of the part played by conservative and neo-liberal think tanks in reversing political trends during the 1970s and 80s, among the most influential of the CPS policy groups was its Personal Capital Foundation Group chaired by Vinson. This produced three proposals that became Government policy - Personal Pensions, Personal Equity Plans (now ISAs), and the Enterprise Allowance scheme. Although he broadly championed the pro-market policies advanced by the IEA and CPS, Vinson repeatedly argued that the high interest rates imposed as the centrepiece of Thatcher's counter inflation policy were needlessly harsh, causing severe and unnecessary hardship. When an independent assessment of UK monetary policy confirmed that this was the case monetary policy was gradually relaxed. From 1980-90 Vinson served as the Chairman of the Rural Development Commission, during which time he initiated a series of reforms designed to remove restrictions and controls on rural enterprise. These included a change to planning laws that enabled redundant farm buildings to be turned into workshops leading to the creation of thousands of small rural firms. Vinson believed that the reforms slowed and ultimately reversed the drift of population from the countryside to towns and cities.Making Things Happen Vinson was Deputy Chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's Smaller Firms Council from 1979-84 and President of the Industrial Participation Association from 1979 to 1989. Vinson was Deputy Chairman of Electra Investment Trust 1990 to 1998. From 1976 to 1978 he was an honorary director of the Queen's Silver Jubilee Appeal. He was a Member of the Northumbrian National Parks and Countryside Committee between 1977 and 1987, and a member of the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1991 and 1996. Since 2003, he has been a Trustee of Civitas (think tank). He was a member of the Design Council from 1973 to 1980. He was founder donor of the Martin Mere Wildfowl Reserve in 1972 and gave a village green to Holbourn, Northumberland, in 2006. Vinson was invested as a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO) in the 1979 New Year Honours (note: prior to 31 December 1984 classified as a Member fourth class (MVO)). On 7 February 1985, he was created a life peer as Baron Vinson, of Roddam Dene in the County of Northumberland. He was a council member of St George's House, Windsor Castle, from 1990 to 1996. Vinson has been married to Yvonne Collin since 1972; they have three daughters and nine grandchildren. He is a regular attender at House of Lords debates, and spoke in the 2007 and 2014 sessions in support of nuclear power, against what he sees as the folly of policies based on costly British renewable generation solutions, increasing, he argues, fuel poverty, whilst the growing world population issue remains unaddressed. On 4 August 2012, Lord Vinson threatened to defect to UKIP unless the Conservatives took a more Better Off Out approach to Europe. On 4 June 2013 he spoke and voted in the Lords against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. The Nigel Vinson Charitable Trust, which Vinson set up in 1970 with an initial donation representing ten percent of current wealth, has since given more than ¬£10 million to educational, humanitarian and environmental projects as well as to individual scholars and public policy foundations.Making Things Happen Beneficiaries have included the University of Buckingham which unveiled the ¬£8 million Vinson Building housing the Vinson Centre for Economics and Entrepreneurship in 2018. In 2019, in an article in Standpointmagazine, Vinson criticised a number of major UK charities for failing to spend their donors' money for purposes other than those for which it was raised, for overpaying senior staff and for staying into political activism.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 28, 2007. It was written by Joel H. Cohen, and directed by Michael Polcino. Plot After the Simpsons' car is cut off by the Rich Texan while driving to the airport for their Miami vacation, Homer's motivation for revenge prompts his family to tell three stories concerning vengeance, hoping to convince Homer that pursuing revenge is not a good idea. =The Count of Monte Fatso= Marge tells a cautionary tale of revenge taking place in 19th century France, parodying the 1844 novel The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas. Moe, parodying Fernand, breaks up the marriage of Homer and Marge, parodying Edmond Dant√®s and Mercedes respectively, by framing Homer as an English traitor. When Moe marries Marge, Homer, now in a French prison, swears revenge. His cellmate, Mr. Burns, parodying Abb√© Faria, tells Homer to find his buried treasure through a tunnel Mr. Burns dug. After initial failure, Homer finds the riches and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Five years later, Homer invites Moe and Marge to a party at his mansion, where Homer kills Moe with a homemade machine, expecting Marge to take him back. However, Marge angrily rebuffs him for killing Moe, asking, \\"Now who's going to take care of the triplets?\\" and showing him the triplets she had with him. At the end of the story, Marge's explanation is that revenge can lead to misery and sadness. However, Homer was listening to the radio at the time and was unintentionally reminded of his revenge. =Revenge of the Geeks= Titled as a parody on the movie Revenge of the Nerds, Lisa's story revolves around Milhouse's campaign to fight back against the school bullies and the consequences when he goes too far. Tired of being bullied by Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney, the geeks plan their revenge. In the science lab, Martin reveals his latest creation, The Getbackinator, a weapon that shoots a ray causing the targeted individuals to perform various playground tortures on themselves such as wedgies and wet willies. Milhouse‚Äîthe only geek with hand‚Äìeye coordination‚Äîuses the weapon on the bullies, but then begins attacking anyone who has ever (accidentally or on purpose) wronged him, including his own friends, such as Martin for accidentally hitting him with a shuttlecock, Richard for being more popular with girls, and Wendell for not giving him \\"Chinese cuts\\" in the lunch line. Milhouse even shoots a first-day student of the school who had never done anything to him, claiming it is \\"prevenge\\". Milhouse gives Groundskeeper Willie an Ultimate Noogie, which decapitates him. Lisa eventually convinces Milhouse to stop, and he reluctantly throws the device aside. Afterwards, Nelson, whom Milhouse forgot about, returns from an absence due to mumps and finds the weapon. Nelson ends up using the weapon against Milhouse. Homer enjoys the story, because it has what he likes in a story: an ending. Lisa claims the moral of the story is that taking revenge makes a person as bad as those who hurt them; Homer claims that the moral is for someone to never put down their weapon, at which point he draws a baseball bat and resumes his pursuit of revenge. =Bartman Begins= Having missed their flight to Miami, Homer begins to approach the Rich Texan to enact his revenge until Bart offers to recount \\"Bartman's 'origin story'\\", based on Batman's origin as revealed in the film Batman Begins. After leaving the Gotham City Opera House, Homer and Marge, parodying Thomas and Martha Wayne respectively, are killed by Snake Jailbird, parodying Joe Chill, in a dark alley. For his last words, Homer pleads Bart, who is parodying Bruce Wayne, to avenge him \\"in flamboyant, impractical fashion\\". Bart does as his father says and swears revenge on Snake, giving birth to his superhero alter ego, Bartman. The alter ego is achieved with the help of his grandfather, who had a past alter ego as the Crimson Cockatoo. Bartman flies around Gotham City, defeating enemies in his way for justice. The villains' Springfield identities are Otto Mann (The Toker), Ned Flanders (The Diddler), Hans Moleman (Mr. Mole), Patty and Selma Bouvier (Sugar and Spice), and Lenny (Poison Lenny), who was not actually a villain, but a transvestite. When Serpent, Snake's alter ego, attempts to steal the \\"Stealable Jewels of the Orient\\" from the Gotham Natural History Museum, Bartman arrives, retrieves the Jewels, and kills Serpent by impaling him on the fangs of a snake statue. Afterward, Lisa, parodying reporter Vicki Vale, reminds Bartman that the Serpent's death will not bring his parents back. Bartman agrees that she has a point, but adds that he feels better since he finally avenged the death of his parents, and has now gained \\"zillions of dollars\\" and freedom from said parents. In conclusion, Bart says that revenge can be satisfying and thus goes against the wishes of Marge and Lisa. However, during the story, Homer is seen to have made amends with the Rich Texan after hearing that they are both from Connecticut. =End credits= At the end, the credits read \\"This episode is dedicated to all who died in the Star Wars films\\". The list includes Darth Vader, Darth Maul (whose death was later retconned by Star Wars: The Clone Wars, although he finally dies in Star Wars Rebels), Greedo, Uncle Owen, Storm Trooper #5, Jango Fett, General Grievous (Droid), Storm Trooper #22, Dak, Obi Wan (Ben) Kenobi, Yoda, \\"Whoever Jimmy Smits Played\\", Hutt, Jabba the, Sy Snoodles, \\"Unfortunately, not Jar-Jar Binks,\\" and \\"everyone on both Death Stars when they blew up\\". There are errors in the list, including the names of Jar Jar Binks and Sy Snootles being spelled incorrectly, and Sy Snootles was not shown to die in Return of the Jedi. Critical reception On TV.com, the episode has a user rating of 8.2 based on 190 votes. Dan Iverson of IGN gave the episode a rating of 7.7, writing \\"While there was some really funny material in the episode, \\"Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times\\" was still under par for The Simpsons. \\"The Count of Monte Fatso\\" showed the fact that the writers can still do a silly parody well, but the other two stories were rather mediocre, relying on gags and humorous visuals to make the segments passable. The trilogy style of episodes continues to be very entertaining, and even though this particular episode wasn't astounding, we will still anticipate the next time that the show gives us parody stories with our favorite television family.\\" References External links Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about revenge Category:The Count of Monte Cristo Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Television episodes set in France ","title":"Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times"},{"id":"7665862","text":"Theater ¬´Petrushka¬ª Tombstone of Vaslav Nijinsky in Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. The statue, donated by Serge Lifar, shows Nijinsky as the puppet Petrushka. Petrushka () is a stock character of Russian folk puppetry. Italian puppeteers introduced it in the first third of the 19th century. While most core characters came from Italy, they were soon transformed by the addition of material from the Russian 'lubki' and 'intermedii.'Catriona Kelly, \\"From Pulcinella to Petrushka: The History of the Russian Glove Puppet Theatre.\\" Oxford Slavonic Papers 21 (1988): 41-63. Petrushkas are traditionally marionettes, as well as hand puppets. The character is a kind of a jester distinguished by his red dress, a red kolpak, and often a long nose. Word origin Although the Russian word \\"petrushka\\" has a homonym meaning \\"parsley\\", in this context the word is actually a hypocoristic (diminutive) for \\"Pyotr\\" (–ü—ë—Ç—Ä), which is Peter in Russian. Despite this, the character has little or nothing in common with the commedia dell'arte stock characters of Petruccio or Pierrot, but is instead a Russian version of Punch or Pulcinella. History Pietro-Mira Pedrillo of Italy, the court jester of the Empress Anna Ioannovna, allegedly served as a prototype for Petrushka. Like Punch, Petrushka's voice was created with the help of a special whistle, and the dialogue was based on a momentary change of the pishchik and the \\"live\\" voice of other characters. There were a number of basic plots: the medical treatment of Petrushka, his learning of soldier‚Äôs service, the scene with his bride, and the buying of a horse and testing it. Initially, Petrushka was characteristic of typical slapstick comedy, targeting an adult audience. As puppet theatre gradually became a predominantly children's entertainment, Petrushka became less vulgar and aggressive. In the Soviet Union, Petrushka appeared widely in agitprop theater, defending poor peasants and attacking kulaks.Richard Pipes, Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime, p305, The Russian Children's Welfare Society (RCWS) hosts an annual \\"Petroushka Ball\\", which is named after a version of the Petrushka character who fell in love with a graceful ballerina.RCWS.org  See also  * Guignol * Petrushka (ballet), music by Igor Stravinsky * Punch and Judy  References   External links  *Petrushka *Petrushka and Vertep: On Traditions of Russian Puppet Theatre Category:Puppets Category:Russian culture Category:Stock characters Category:Traditional dolls ","title":"Petrushka"},{"id":"7665870","text":"Jeffrey Roger Goodwin (born January 28, 1958) is a professor of sociology at New York University. He holds a BA, MA (Sociology) and PhD (Sociology) from Harvard University. His research interests include social movements, revolutions, political violence, and terrorism. He is a past chair of the Comparative and Historical Sociology Section and the Collective Behavior and Social Movements Section of the American Sociological Association (ASA). The underlying argument of his best known book, No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991, is that revolutionary movements are not only a response to economic inequality or exploitation, but are also a response to political repression and violence. Goodwin has written and edited a number of works with his friend and former NYU colleague James M. Jasper. They wrote a famous critique of the political-opportunity theory developed by Charles Tilly and Doug McAdam, republished in Rethinking Social Movements, which Goodwin and Jasper edited. They also edited The Contexts Reader (New York: W. W. Norton), Social Movements (Routledge), The Social Movements Reader (Wiley-Blackwell), and (with Francesca Polletta) Passionate Politics (University of Chicago Press), a leading work in the sociology of emotions. In October 2011, Goodwin was one of 132 New York University (NYU) faculty and staff members who signed a statement calling for disinvestment in several American companies that do business in Israel. In response to sharp criticism from Congressman Gary Ackerman, Goodwin accused Ackerman of moral blindness and stated that \\"Ackerman's apparent denial that Israel is occupying Palestinian territories and systematically violating basic Palestinian rights is simply shocking.\\"Rep.

First published in the literary journal Sur in December 1940, it was included in the 1941 collection The Garden of Forking Paths () and the 1944 collection Ficciones. It was first published in English in View (Series V, No. 6 1946), translated by Paul Bowles. Epigraph The story's epigraph is taken from Chapter 4 of Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll: \\"And if he left off dreaming about you...\\". It comes from the passage in which Tweedledee points out the sleeping Red King to Alice, and claims she is simply a character in his dream.Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass 38 Plot A wizard arrives by canoe at the burned ruins of an ancient temple. The temple is centered on the statue of an ambiguous deity that appears to be a tiger or a horse. The wizard immediately falls asleep; his goal, the narrator reveals, is to \\"dream a man... in his minute entirety and impose him on reality.\\" Local villagers bring the wizard food, and he spends most of his time sleeping in the ruins. At first, the wizard dreams that he is addressing a group of pupils on anatomy, cosmography, and magic; he hopes to find among his pupils \\"a soul worthy of participating in the universe.\\" The wizard eventually narrows the group of students down to a boy who resembles him, but soon finds himself stricken with insomnia and unable to continue dreaming. After taking a rest to regain his strength, the wizard attempts a different tactic: he begins to dream a man piece by piece, beginning with his heart and slowly adding other organs and features. The process takes over a year and is painstaking. At a point of frustration, the wizard consults the temple's deity, which in a dream is revealed to be a multifaceted deity known as \\"Fire\\" that also can appear as a bull, a rose, and a storm. Fire promises the wizard that he will bring the dreamed man into reality, and that everyone but Fire and the wizard will believe the conjured man to be flesh and blood. Fire demands that after the conjured man's education is finished he be sent to another ruined temple downstream \\"so that some voice would glorify him in that deserted edifice.\\" The wizard spends two years instructing the conjured man, whom he comes to view as his son. Though he secretly dreads their separation, the wizard eventually sends his son to the second temple. Before he does so, though, he destroys his son's memory of his apprenticeship, \\"so that his son should never know he is a phantom, so that he shall think of himself as a man like any other.\\" The wizard remains at his temple and hears word from travelers of his son, who is reportedly able to walk on fire without being burned. Though the wizard still worries his son will find out his true origins, his fears are interrupted by a forest fire that emerges from the south and envelops the ruined temple. Accepting death, the wizard walks into the flames. He feels no pain and realizes \\"with relief, with humiliation, with terror\\" that he too is an illusion, and that someone else is dreaming him. Themes The short story deals with themes that recur in Borges's work: idealism, the manifestation of thoughts in the \\"real world\\", meaningful dreams, and immortality. The manifestation of thoughts as objects in the real world was a theme in \\"Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\", but here Borges takes it to another level: the manifestation of human beings rather than simple objects. The story also seems to symbolize writers as creators who engender one another and whose existence and originality would be impossible without their predecessors, a theme he wrote about in other works such as \\"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\\", another short story from the Ficciones collection. Its treatment of dreaming reality and free will is similar to La vida es sue√±o, a Spanish play published in 1635 by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca.

She sailed for this company for 38 years hauling iron ore and coal until 1955 when she was sold to the Wilson Marine Transit Company. It was in this fleet that she received her current name. For this company she carried a wider array of bulk goods including grains and stone. Valley Camp was a member of the Wilson Fleet only until 1959 when the Republic Steel Corporation bought her and several of her Wilson fleetmates, including her identical sister ship Silver Bay (formerly Albert Heiken of National Steel). Republic kept Valley Camps name, and for that company she hauled iron ore and coal to their mills in Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; and Indiana Harbor, Indiana. In 1966, Valley Camp made her last voyage. Her age was not an issue in her retirement, but a major problem with a coal-burning boiler was, Her twin, Silver Bay, went on to sail until the early 1980s.

The ship was powered by a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine which she retains to this day. Never the flagship of the fleet, her quarters were spartan yet comfortable. The crews quarters are lined by wood trim and equipped with simple bunks. The wheelhouse is lined with wood and trimmed by brass. Her original steering wheel is in place. In the stern, her original smokestack, including her double-chime whistle are still in place. Almost unmodified from her original configuration, she is the most intact example of the classic Great Lakes ore carriers that once numbered in the hundreds and few of which survive to this day.

The game (which also would be the first NCAA football game played in the Southern Hemisphere), was to have been held at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, matching up the third place teams from the then Pacific-10 Conference (now the Pac-12 Conference) and Western Athletic Conference (stopped playing football after the 2012-13 season). The payout for participating teams was set at $1.5 million, double the NCAA's standard minimum at that time, and the minimum payout set for an international game. However, the contest, scheduled for 27 December 1996, was never played: when the Haka Bowl committee could not come up with financial guarantees, the NCAA revoked the license for the game, and the idea died.

A rump state is the remnant of a once much larger state, left with a reduced territory in the wake of secession, annexation, occupation, decolonization, or a successful coup d'√©tat or revolution on part of its former territory. In the latter case, a government stops short of going into exile because it still controls part of its former territory. Examples =Ancient history= * Seleucid Empire after losing most of its territory to the Parthian Empire. * After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in Gaul, the Kingdom of Soissons survived as a rump state under Aegidius and Syagrius until conquered by the Franks under Clovis I in 486. =Post-classical history= * After the Jin dynasty assumed control over northern China, the Southern Song existed as a rump state of the Northern Song. * After the Madurai Sultanate assumed control over most of Pandya Nadu, and which was later captured by Vijayanagara Empire, the Southern Pandyas formed a rump state from 1330 to 1422 ruling over modern day Tirunelveli and Thuthukudi districts along with certain regions of Western Ghats. They further lost their territory and ruled from Tenkasi region as Tenkasi Pandyas formed a rump state there until 1623. * After the Ming dynasty established control over China proper, the Yuan dynasty retreated to the Mongolian Plateau and survived as a rump state called the Northern Yuan. *After the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532, the Neo-Inca State based at Vilcabamba survived as a rump state until 1572. * After the Qing dynasty assumed control over most of China proper, the Ming dynasty survived as a rump state called the Southern Ming. =Modern history= * The Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth was left as a rump state after the First Partition of Poland by Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1772. The resulting rump state was partitioned again in 1793 and annexed outright in 1795. After Napoleon's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1807, he created a new Polish rump state, the Duchy of Warsaw. After Napoleon's defeat, the Congress of Vienna created a state, Congress Poland in 1815; it is unclear whether this should be seen as a rump state or a puppet state. * The Hungarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed in March 1919 after the resignation of the government of the First Hungarian Republic when, following their absorption of the Social Democrats, the Communists took control of the country. Though sometimes controlling only around 23% of the territory of the Hungarian state, after some initial military successes, in the end the army was defeated and the government fell in August 1919. * The Republic of German-Austria was created in 1918 as the initial rump state for areas with a predominantly German- speaking population within what had been the Austro-Hungarian Empire. * The rump Republic of Sal√≤ (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, 1943‚Äì1945), led by Benito Mussolini, claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Kingdom of Italy; it was in fact a puppet state of Nazi Germany.James Hartfield, Unpatriotic History of the Second World War, , 2012, p. 424Eric Morris, Circles of Hell: The War in Italy 1943-1945, , 1993, p. 140 * At the height of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949) (ROC) retreated to the island territory of Taiwan (marking the establishment of the modern de facto state of Taiwan). Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took control of mainland China and established the People's Republic of China (PRC) following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949. The political status of Taiwan prior to 1949 was already complex; strictly speaking, it was not part of China despite being under Chinese occupation (the ROC unilaterally annexed Taiwan from the Empire of Japan in 1945 during the aftermath of WWII), though it also wasn't an independent country nor was it actively claimed by any other country. Since 1949, some sources have regarded the ROC on Taiwan as a rump state, based on the premise that Taiwan is part of China, whereas other sources have regarded the ROC on Taiwan as a government in exile, based on the premise that Taiwan is not part of China. * Pakistan was left a rump state by the secession of Bangladesh in 1971 after the Bangladeshi War of Independence (where about 55% of the Pakistani population living in East Pakistan seceded from the remaining 45% who were West Pakistanis). * Ethiopia was left a rump state by the independence of Eritrea in 1991 after the Eritrean War of Independence. * The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is, the name the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro used from 1992 to 2003, was often viewed as the rump state left behind by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945‚Äì1992) when it broke up. This view of it was held not only by its founders, but also by many people antagonistic to them. In fiction *In the manga and anime series Attack on Titan, the nation of Eldia existed in an upside down map of Africa. It later grew unstable due to internal conflicts between the families with the power of the Titans, and collapsed during the Great Titan War a century ago. Eldia lost most of its land as well as seven of the Nine Titans to a newly reborn Marley, a nation long persecuted by Eldia, and many Eldians retreated to Paradis Island, the surviving rump state of Eldia. The 145th Eldian King, Karl Fritz raised the Walls with thousands of Colossal Titans to protect Eldia from Marley and the other nations of the world, and erased the memories of Eldia from the ethnic group, the Subjects of Ymir inside.

The family lived in a series of houses beginning on Long Island where Brown bought a 100-acre estate on St. James Harbor where they raised and raced horses. They commissioned Archibald Manning Brown to design a large, modern country house, although they never lived in it. (It's now known as the Knox School). While Brown served in Congress and as the assistant to the Secretary of Interior, they lived near the White House in Washington. They later moved to Manhattan, then The Windmill on Montauk Point, and Boston.  Purchase of ranch in Big Sur  H√©l√®ne Hooper Brown, Lathrop Brown, and daughters Halla and Camilla, about 1915 In 1924, Brown and his wife H√©l√®ne Hooper Brown, who at age 15 in 1910 inherited $10,000,000 and became an orphan at the same time, visited Big Sur, California, seeking some wild land on which they might build a house. They bought the Saddle Rock Ranch totaling 1,600 acres from pioneer homesteader Christopher McWay, after which Julia Pfieffer Burns leased some land for cattle. H√©l√®ne became a good friend of Julia until the latter died in 1928. = Build Waterfall House on coast = The Browns first built a redwood cabin on the cliffs across from McWay Falls, which at the time fell directly into the ocean. It was located where the Waterfall Overlook is today, but the location then and now is often shrouded by a marine layer of cold fog. The Carmel-San Simeon Highway was completed in 1937, and in 1940 the Browns constructed \\"Waterfall House\\" to replace the cabin. The multi-story house had a 16 foot wide marble staircase at its base and fine furnishings. An ornamental brass fish, a large gold octopus with long tentacles, and a compass rose were inlaid in the entryway. They decorated the home with art by Degas, Dufy and Gauguin. Very large windows overlooking the Pacific Ocean. H√©l√®ne Brown's bedroom was the only room with a direct view of the waterfall. The small room was painted entirely black and had gold stars on the ceiling. One large window looked out on the falls. The bathroom adjacent to her bedroom was finished in a deep blue tile inlaid with gold, and mirrors were mounted and positioned to create endless reflections. Behind the house were terraced gardens and a caretaker's cottage. The house was sited about halfway down the cliff from the newly completed highway. To reach it, visitors boarded a short Funicular railway. It was a beautiful contemporary building, But the house experienced the same weather conditions as the cabin before it. The Browns wanted a home out of the fog's reach. = First electricity on coast = Hans Ewoldsen, the Saddle Rock Ranch foreman, built a Pelton wheel on McWay Creek in 1932. He worked in the machine shop of the highway construction crew, using hand-split redwood from the canyon and other materials he bought. The undershot wheel ran a 32-volt generator and was the first electric power in the Big Sur area. It supplied power to three residences, a blacksmith shop, and the Funicular railway. = Construct Tin House inland = In 1944, during World War II, they decided to build a house three miles inland on a ridge high above the fog. War-time rationing of vital supplies - included building materials - meant some ingenuity was required for the project. A side impact of the rationing was that gasoline was in short supply, forcing some gas stations out of business. The Browns saw opportunity in adversity and bought two abandoned gas station buildings. They selected a site on a ridge 1,960 ft (597m) above the coast, built a road, hired a crew to haul the deconstructed tin gas stations up the steep road, and paid an architect to assemble a home using those various parts. When complete, the distinctive, modern house had bold lines, along with a kitchen, living room, and quarters for a maid. The family called it the \\"Gas Station\\" house, although it later become known as \\"Tin House\\". The home had spectacular views. The main windows in the large living room looked not out to sea, but up and down the coast. A wall was constructed facing due west to block the intense, direct rays of the afternoon sun. The living room was richly painted in blue. Despite the beautiful sights above the reach of the fog, legend has it that the Browns only spent one night in the new residence. They hadn't anticipated the metal siding and roof expanding and contracting with the day-time heat and night-time cold, and the unexpected, noisy popping and creaking from the tin siding was unacceptable to the Browns. After a sleepless night, they never returned. Brown was elected to the sheriff's posse of Monterey County in 1947. A story exists that Tin House was built as a vacation getaway for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In actuality, Lathrop Brown and Franklin Roosevelt were childhood friends and each other's best man when they married. But FDR never visited the Tin House. Lathrop and H√©l√®ne left Big Sur for Florida in 1956, where Lathrop died in 1959. In 1961, H√©l√®ne Hooper Brown donated the entire property to the state, stipulating that it be used as a park and named for her good friend, Julia Pfeiffer Burns, a \\"true pioneer.\\" She included the requirement that Waterfall House be converted into a museum within five years to house Big Sur history, otherwise that it be razed. For several reasons this was not accomplished and the mansion was demolished in 1966. The Waterfall Overlook of McWay Falls was built on that spot. Visitors to the site today can view the remnants of the home's landscaping, including palm trees. The Pelton wheel is on display as well.  Later life  Brown was a member of a committee to supervise the Graduate School of Public Administration of Harvard University in 1954 and 1955. He died in Fort Myers, Florida and was cremated; the ashes were interred in Abbey of the Light, Manasota Memorial Park, Sarasota, Florida. His home at Nissequogue, New York, known as Land of Clover, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

The islands of Jost Van Dyke and its smaller neighbor Little Jost Van Dyke (\\"Little Jost\\"), as well as Little Dix Bay on Virgin Gorda island, are named after him. Soper's Hole settlement Fort Recovery The early colonial history of the British Virgin Islands is not especially well documented. However, it is known that during the early years of the seventeenth century, Van Dyk had created a small settlement at Soper's Hole on Tortola's West End, leading a largely unremarkable career as a privateer or pirate, and that he was trading with the Spanish settlers in Puerto Rico in breach of a Papal concession to the Spaniards. Between raids, Van Dyk and his crew farmed cotton and tobacco. By 1615 Van Dyk's settlement was recorded in Spanish contemporary records as having expanded, and consisting of Dutch, French and English pirates, who had constructed some small defences. At this time the Spanish Governor in Puerto Rico began to regard Van Dyk less as an irritation and more as a potential threat to Spanish trading interests in the region. However, at the time the Dutch Republic and Spain were subject to a binding truce. When the truce came to an end in 1620 Van Dyk perceived his potential vulnerability, and built a more substantial earthen fort at what would later be named Fort Recovery. Road Town settlement By 1625 Van Dyk was recognised by the Dutch West India Company as the private \\"Patron\\" of Tortola, and had moved his operations to Road Town (at that time, simply known as \\"The Road\\"). During the same year Van Dyk lent some limited (non-military) support to the Dutch Admiral Boudewijn Hendricksz, who sacked San Juan, Puerto Rico (although he was unable to take Fort San Felipe del Morro). In 1628 Dutch Admiral Piet Heyn plundered the Spanish treasure fleet, and these two attacks stung the Spanish to retaliation. In September 1625 the Spanish led a full assault on the island of Tortola, laying waste to its defences and destroying its nascent settlements. Joost van Dyk himself escaped to the island that would later bear his name, and sheltered there from the Spanish. He later moved to the island of Saint Thomas until the Spanish gave up their attacks and returned to Puerto Rico. Baugher's Bay settlement Remains of Fort George Despite their limited economic importance, the Dutch West India Company still considered the Virgin Islands to have an important strategic value, as they were located approximately halfway between the Dutch West India Company's colonies in Brazil and New Amsterdam (now New York City). Under the orders of Peter Stuyvesant, the director of the Dutch West India Company, Van Dyk built large stone warehouses at Freebottom, near Port Purcell (just east of Road Town), with the intention that these warehouses would facilitate exchanges of cargo between North and South America. Fearing a repetition of the recent attack, Van Dyk erected some small earthworks and a three-cannon fort above the warehouse, on the hill where Fort George would eventually be built by the English. He also constructed a wooden stockade to act as a lookout post above Road Town on the site that would eventually become Fort Charlotte. He also stationed troops at the Spanish \\"dojon\\" near Pockwood Pond, later to be known at Fort Purcell, but now ordinarily referred as \\"the Dungeon\\". Virgin Gorda settlement In 1631 the Dutch West India Company expressed an interest in the copper which had been discovered on Virgin Gorda. Joost van Dyk set up another settlement on that island, which came to be known as \\"Little Dyk's\\" (now known as Little Dix). Decline of the Dutch West India Company Notwithstanding the strategic location of the settlements, or the discovery of copper, the settlements were not an economic success, and the evidence suggests that Van Dyk spent most of his time more profitably engaged in privateering (or piracy, depending upon one's perspective). The lack of prosperity of the territory mirrored the lack of commercial success of the Dutch West India Company as a whole. The company changed its policy, and it sought to cede islands such as Tortola and Virgin Gorda to private persons for settlement, and to establish slave pens. The island of Tortola was eventually sold to Willem Hunthum at some point in the 1650s, at which time the Dutch West India Company's interest in the Territory effectively ended. Death In September 1625, Joost van Dyk's recorded involvement with the British Virgin Islands came to an end. He is believed to have died in or after 1631.

Early life Ishimoto was born to a samurai-class family in Himeji, Harima Province (present-day Hy≈çgo Prefecture). Soon after his birth, his family's house in Edo was destroyed in the Ansei earthquake of 1854, and in the subsequent Meiji Restoration, his father lost his employment and privileged status. Despite his family's desperate financial situation, he was sent to the Daigaku Nank≈ç (the predecessor of Tokyo Imperial University) for a military education, and was enlisted as a cadet in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. Military career In February, 1875, Ishimoto was accepted into the 1st class of the new Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and enrolled in the military engineering program. He was able to put his education to immediate use in the Satsuma Rebellion. Afterwards, from 1879‚Äì1882, he was sent as a military attach√© to France, where he was able to complete his education in engineering and artillery at the French Army's √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. He returned to Japan for a year, and was sent overseas again from 1883 to 1887 as military attach√© to the Kingdom of Italy. On his return to Japan, his rise through the ranks was rapid. He was promoted to colonel in 1895, and major general in 1897, and became an instructor in military engineering, first at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and then at the Army Staff College, and afterwards he worked as a section head in the Japanese Army Corps of Engineers. His knowledge and ability caught the eye of General Terauchi Masatake, who made him a chief of staff during the Russo-Japanese War. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1904.Dupuy, Encyclopedia of Military Biography After the war, Ishimoto was elevated to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. In 1911, Ishimoto was appointed Army Minister under the cabinet of Prime Minister Saionji Kinmochi.Wendel, Axis History Factbook At the time, there was a major controversy between the Army's demand for an expansion by two additional infantry divisions, and the cabinet's insistence that there was not enough money in the budget to pay for the expansion. He died while in office, at the relatively young age of 59, with the issue unresolved. His grave is located at the temple of Tenno-ji, located in Tait≈ç, Tokyo. Ishimoto's wife was the daughter of General Adachi Shotar≈ç. They had several children; their second and fifth sons also rose to the rank of general in the Imperial Japanese Army, and were killed in World War II.

In 1905, Hadow was elected the first Old Malvernian member of the Council of Malvern College.The Council, The Malvern Register (1865-1904), 1904 In 1909, he was appointed principal of Armstrong College in the Newcastle Division of Durham University before succeeding, as Warden and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Durham in 1916. In 1919, he was appointed the Vice-Chancellor of Sheffield University (1919‚Äì30). As chairman of several committees, he published a series of reports on education, notably The Education of the Adolescent (1926). This called for the re-organization of elementary education and the abandonment of all-age schools (separate schools from the age of 11, when existing schools, both state and voluntary (i.e. associated with a particular religious denomination), often educated children up to the age of 14), and the creation of secondary modern schools for children over the age of 11. These became known as the Hadow Reports. He was a leading influence in English education at all levels in the 1920s and 1930s. He chaired a committee, established in 1926 jointly by the British Broadcasting Company (later BBC) and the British Institute of Adult Education, to report on the possibilities of using radio broadcasting for education. The results were published as a book, \\"New Ventures in Broadcasting - A Study in Adult Education\\". Hadow wrote and edited a number of publications on literature, music and music theory. He took on the general editorship of the original six volume edition of the Oxford History of Music between 1901 and 1905, writing the fifth volume (covering the period from C.P.E.

The building, which forms part of a series of imposing buildings at Chester Castle, is a Grade I listed building. History The current building replaced a previous shire hall which had been built just outside the main gate in 1310 but which was in a derelict state by the late 18th century. In 1785 the justices insisted that an architectural competition be held for a new shire hall as well as a new prison to be located behind the new shire hall: the site selected for the new complex formed part of the outer bailey of the castle. Work on the new complex began with the demolition of the old buildings in 1788. The new shire hall was designed by Thomas Harrison and completed in 1801. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nineteen bays facing onto Castle Square with the end bays projecting forwards slightly; the central section of seven bays featured a large hexastyle portico with twelve Doric order columns (in two rows), projecting forwards by about with a plain tympanum above. Its two-storey fa√ßade was about long and high. Internally, the principal room was an imposing main courtroom which was inspired by the School of Anatomy in Paris. It was described by Charles Dupin as \\"most assuredly the handsomest of this kind that is to be seen in Europe.\\"The Builder, volume 21, p. 204 The prison, which Harrison had also designed and which had been located behind the shire hall, was demolished in 1902. A statue of Queen Victoria, designed by Frederick William Pomeroy, was unveiled outside the share hall by the Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton, on 17 October 1903. The building was used as a facility for dispensing justice from the early 19th century and was latterly used as a Crown Court. Famous trials at the court have included those of the Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, known as the Moors Murderers, in April 1966. Bullet proof glass was erected around the dock to ensure the two defendants were protected during the trial. The court was also the venue for the trial of Peter Reyn-Bardt, accused of murdering his estranged wife, Malika de Fernandez in December 1983; Reyn-Bardt was convicted based on his confession even though the human remains which had been dug up and which had led to his arrest were subsequently dated to the Roman period. The court also saw the trial and conviction of Howard Hughes for the murder of Sophie Hook in June 1996.

This is in contrast to secondary tumors of the heart, which are typically either metastatic from another part of the body, or infiltrate the heart via direct extension from the surrounding tissues. Types Micrograph of an atrial myxoma, the most common primary tumor of the heart. =Benign= The most common primary tumor of the heart is the myxoma. In surgical series, the myxoma makes up as much as 77% of all primary tumors of the heart. Less common tumors of the heart include lipoma and cystic tumor of the atrioventricular nodal region. =Malignant= About 20 percent of primary tumors of the heart are malignant in nature. Malignant tumors of the heart include rhabdomyosarcomas, angiosarcomas, myxosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, reticulum cell sarcomas, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and liposarcomas. The cardiac sarcomas may occur at any age, but are more commonly seen in individuals in their 20s to 40s. They occur equally in males and females. =Valvular= A subset of the primary tumors of the heart are tumors that are found on the valves of the heart. Tumors that affect the valves of the heart are found in an equal distribution among the four heart valves. The vast majority of these are papillary fibroelastomas. Primary tumors of the valves of the heart are more likely to occur in males. While most primary tumors of the valves of the heart are not malignant, they are more likely to have symptoms related to the valve, including neurologic symptoms and (in a few cases) sudden cardiac death. Prognosis The vast majority of the tumors of the heart have a benign course and are not directly fatal. However, even the benign tumors of the heart can be lethal due to either direct extension into the electrical conduction system of the heart (causing complete heart block or a fatal dysrhythmia), or due to emboli from the tumor mass that may have lethal sequelae. The malignant tumors of the heart have a worse prognosis. Cardiac sarcomas generally lead to death within 2 years of diagnosis, due to rapid infiltration of the myocardium of the heart and obstruction of the normal flow of blood within the heart.

Skorodumov was born in 1892. He graduated the 1st Cadet Corps and the Pavlovsk Military Academy in 1912, as a sub-lieutenant of the Pavlovsk detachment. In 1914 with his detachment he was sent to the front. He was awarded the St. Vladimir order for bravery in battle, during which he was heavily wounded and consequently placed off duty. Skorodumov lobbied strongly to return to the front, and in 1915 was taken prisoner by the Germans. He unsuccessfully tried to escape three times, and after seven months of imprisonment returned to St. Petersburg in a prisoner exchange agreement (thanks partly to the lobbying of Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna). He was awarded the Cross of St. George for bravery. In the wake of the October Revolution Skorodumov joined an underground anti-Bolshevik officer's organization. Upon its discovery by the Reds, he fled to join the Volunteer Army in the south of Russia. He served in the army as an invalid wearing a prosthesis, and was additionally wounded in the leg during the siege of Kiev in 1919. After being interred in Poland he left for the army of General Pyotr Wrangel in the Crimea. After Wrangel's defeat, Skorodumov evacuated with the army to Gallipoli, after which he moved to Bulgaria. As a commandant in the city of Lovech, he left with General Alexander Kutepov to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There in Yugoslavia, Skorodumov built a memorial for the fallen Russian veterans of World War I. In 1941, Skorodumov offered the German occupying forces in Yugoslavia to form the Russian Corps, an independent armed outfit of Russian white emigres with the purpose of defending the local Russian populace from the atrocities of communist guerillas. Skorodumov hoped that the Germans would agree to deploy the Corps on the Eastern front, where it would become the centre of a Russian anti-communist liberation movement. The German forces agreed to work with Skorodumov and appointed him as the head of the Russian Corps, only to be arrested by the Gestapo three days later for proclaiming the corps as an \\"independent\\" armed force. Skorodumov passed on command to Boris Shteifon, whom the Germans approved of. After leaving jail, Skorodumov demonstratively refused to join the Corps and worked for three years as a cobbler. In 1944, Skorodumov decided to enlist in the Corps as a private, then went to Austria to save his family from the advancing communist armies. He moved to the United States and pleaded with the \\"Humanity Calls\\" organization to help the veterans of the Corps receive displaced person status, thus enabling them to seek refuge in the United States. Skorodumov died in Los Angeles on November 15, 1963, and was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

It stemmed from the Free Association of German Trade Unions (FDVG) which combined with the Ruhr region's Freie Arbeiter Union on September 15, 1919. The FAUD was involved in the revolution in Germany from 1918‚Äì1923, and continued to be involved in the German labor movement after the FAUD began to decline in 1923. After 1921, the FAUD added an \\"AS\\" to their name, signifying a full transition from simple syndicalism to anarcho-syndicalism. This also led to further difficulties between the intellectual elites of the FAUD (AS), such as Rudolf Rocker, and the rank and file workers, mostly in the Ruhr, who were more worried about \\"bread and butter\\" issues than anarchist political activities. These workers, the majority of the FAUD-(AS) members, formed the :Gelsenkircherichtung (Gelsenkirche tendency) within the movement, and given the movements federalist structure, began to drift away from the FAUD-(AS) intellectually and organizationally. Eventually, those workers who had joined during the revolution left the movement and the remaining FAUD-(AS) members came from the FDVG's original constituencies of the building trades and specialized textile workers. The Nazis suppressed the FAUD in January 1933 after coming to power. However, many of its members continued to do political work illegally and organized resistance against the Nazi regime, both in Germany and elsewhere (see: Gruppe DAS and the revolution in Spain, 1936‚Äì1939). The International Workers Association, of which the FAUD was a member, was founded upon the initiative of the German organization in 1922. The Free Workers' Union (FAU), which was founded in 1977, sees itself in the tradition of the FAUD. At its peak, the FAUD had 150,000 members. The primary organ of the FAUD was the newspaper Der Syndikalist, which was first published in December 1918, and continued until the groups suppression by the Nazis.Hans Manfred Bock, ‚ÄúAnarchosyndicalism in the German Labour Movement: a Rediscovered Minority Tradition.‚Äù In Revolutionary Syndicalism: An International Perspective, translated by Wayne Thorpe, 59‚Äì80 (Aldershot, England: Scolar Press, 1990) pp. 59-80; This text gives a general overview of the topic in English.

The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 6,018. It was the subject of an article in a special report by The Economist entitled \\"A new kind of ghetto\\", which described it a predominantly White area of high unemployment and low aspirations. Corner Brook, Stockbridge Village Barons Hey, Stockbridge Village History Cantril Farm was built in the mid 1960s to rehouse some 15,000 people from inner-city slum clearances. It was part of a deal to rehouse some 200,000 people from inner-city Liverpool in new residential areas beyond the city's borders, with other families from inner- city Liverpool moving to other overspill places like Leasowe, Huyton, Kirkby, Halewood, Skelmersdale and later, Runcorn New Town. The land on which Cantril Farm would be built was purchased by Liverpool council in 1961 for a sum of ¬£132,500. The first homes on the estate were ready for occupation during 1965, but initially the estate lacked facilities such as public transport, health care and shops, these facilities not being provided until about 1967. Mobile shops were located on the estate until permanent buildings were erected. The first pub on the estate was opened in 1968, around the same time that the first bus routes were established. Subways were also erected to underpass the busiest roads on the estate for pedestrian safety. Small supermarkets were also erected in the late 1960s and the Withens Shopping Centre opened in 1970. St Jude's Parish Church was opened in 1972 at a cost of ¬£40,000. St Albert's Roman Catholic church opened in 1966, and later on Cantril Farm Methodist Church opened. A second Parish Church, St Brigid's, opened in October 1967. In the autumn of 1968 two primary schools were opened on the estate - St Albert's and St Brigid's. Cantril High School was also opened to serve pupils aged 11‚Äì16, but it was only open for just over 20 years, closing in July 1991 due to falling pupil numbers. It was damaged in an arson attack not long after its closure and eventually demolished. A total of nine tower blocks were built in the late 1960s, however four of these were demolished in the 1990s and the five that remain have been refurbished in a multimillion-pound regeneration project which covered the whole estate. However, the estate was in deep decline by 1980. There was a riot on the estate in 1981. By 1982, unemployment on the estate was at 49% among males and 80% among young people. burglary and violent crime were rife on the estate. Shop units were becoming vacant. Household spaces were also becoming vacant as families were wanting to leave the estate and the vacant properties were difficult to let to new tenants. Two school buildings on the estate were wrecked in arson attacks and had to be completely rebuilt. Car theft was a serious problem in the 1980s and 1990s, when joyriding was at its peak nationally, as were arson attacks on parked vehicles. Stockbridge Village Trust Limited was established on 18 February 1983 as a non-profit-making Private Company limited by guarantee. The estate within the Borough of Knowsley, which was owned by the Borough Council, was conveyed to the Trust on 6 April 1983, at the District Valuer's valuation of more than ¬£7million. This resulted in the Cantril Farm Estate being split, with two-thirds owned by the Trust, and one third owned by Liverpool City Council. The main part of the estate was renamed Stockbridge Village, while the section in Liverpool retained the Cantril Farm name. As well as the demolition of the tower blocks, some 600 maisonettes and 340 low-rise flats were also bulldozed. The remaining properties were refurbished. The layout of the estate was altered to improve vehicular access. The shopping and recreational areas of the estate were also improved or replaced. All council properties on the estate were transferred to the Village housing association in 1995. In 2010, further regeneration work began on Stockbridge Village seeing a number of changes, such as the famous Heat Waves swimming baths being demolished as well as St Dominic's school being replaced by a new community centre and two new schools.

It was published by SoftKey Multimedia. It is a revised version of the original The Oregon Trail video game. It was redesigned with the help of American Studies PhD Wayne Studer. In contrast to the original version of the game, Oregon Trail II made an effort to include greater roles for women and racial minorities. In addition to the regular edition, MECC released a 25th Anniversary Limited Edition Oregon Trail II Computer Game. The CD-ROM came with an official strategy guide and certificate of authenticity, all packaged in a commemorative wooden storage box. Development alt=A screenshot from the Windows version of Oregon Trail II. Oregon Trail II graphics are considerably more detailed than those in the original. In addition, events such as diseases (including dysentery, measles, cholera, and others), obstacles on the path, accidents while traveling, and even interactions with other groups in one's wagon train involve being directed to choose a course of action from a set of multiple choices. Gameplay When players start a new game, they can choose their name, occupation, level, date of travel, their starting point and destination, and type of wagon. Also, they may select how many others are with them in their wagon, along with their names and ages. After selecting an occupation, the player can select various skills. The player chooses skills with a 120-point limit. Automatic skills are free. The more important the skill is, the more it costs. Each skill can make good events more likely to happen, and bad events less likely to happen. While some occupations have more money than others, the low income occupations get a greater final bonus, which proves crucial in getting a high score in the end of the game. However, if the player settles at a destination other than the one they had selected at the start of the game, they will not receive a bonus, regardless of their chosen occupation. Oregon Trail II includes far more detail than the original. For instance, rafting down the Columbia River is a much greater challenge than it was in the original game. Whenever an event (e.g. an accident or illness) happens, the game halts and the player must make a choice of action, so it is much more interactive than the previous version. Players are also able to talk with other settlers along the way and ask their advice. At any point in the game, if the player dies, the game is over. This version also allows the player to choose between 21 years of travel (rather than 1 in the original) from 1840 to 1860. Travel is much easier in later years, as there are more towns and trading posts along the way for resupply. The online guidebook resource alters its displayed help based upon the year of travel, but not with the target and trailhead ends chosenhence to read the book, one needs to wade past pages of useless information applicable to sub- scenarios (such as alternate routes over a local regional stretch) one hasn't chosen. Outfitting the supplies and choosing the parties equipment of their journey becomes a possible point of player control leading to increased scoring chances. Additional supplies means adding weight to the player's wagon. When the wagon's weight limit is reached, it is not possible to continue on the trail and some goods will have to be dumped. The game offers players an immense selection of supplies available for purchase. During the beginning of the game, package deals are available up to six months of provisions. However, many perils in the game will cause many provisions to be lost or used for trade. One has the option of taking a computer generated \\"package deal\\", ostensibly offered by the trailhead town's merchants. Or the player can shop the town and choose a custom strategy, quantities, tools and so forthor take the package then shop or trade in addition to that. One problem with the package is finding someone to trade for unwanted items for useful ones. Conversely, some assets are only available by the package (e.g. Chains, anvils, plows) or by tradingthough many of those can be purchased from merchants or blacksmiths farther down the trails. If a player decides to buy supplies without the package, the player may buy chains or anvils from Westport, Fort Kearny or Fort Laramie. All forts or towns with a blacksmith's shop will sell chains, nails (measured in pounds), and anvils. 25th Anniversary Limited Edition This version includes Oregon Trail II 1.3, Oregon Trail for DOS 2.1, Oregon Trail Deluxe VGA 3.01, Oregon Trail for Windows 1.2, series of 5 interview videos for Oregon Trail game history, a collector's wooden box package with branded artwork on the sides, The Oregon Trail Strategy Guide, $25.00 rebate coupons for MECC/SoftKey International products, and a limited edition stamped certificate of authenticity. Remake The Oregon Trail 5th Edition: Adventures Along the Oregon Trail is a 2001 video game, and the sequel to The Oregon Trail 4th Edition. =Gameplay= The game design is based on Oregon Trail II, but adds various new features to the game. The plant gathering feature was carried over from editions 3 and 4. The \\"Wild Fruits and Vegetables\\" event from Oregon Trail II is removed. This feature involves identifying which plants are edible and which are poisonous. (Incidentally, the option to \\"go look for edible plants\\" whenever someone is diagnosed with scurvy was kept.) The player can also go fishing. Updated graphics have been provided for river crossings. There are also added cinematics which follow the fictional journey of the three Montgomery children: Parker, Cassie, and Jimmy, who leave Independence accompanied by an African-American trailblazer named Captain Jed Freedman to search for the children's father in Oregon. Various points of the children's story are triggered when the player reaches a certain destination on the trail, which ranges from dangerous experiences (Jimmy is bitten by a snake) to campfire scenes in which Captain Jed would tell a story that reflects other historically accurate incidents (e.g. the Donner Party, the California Gold Rush, and the Santa Fe Trail).
